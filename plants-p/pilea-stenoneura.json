    "intro": "Pilea stenoneura, commonly known as the Shiny Pilea, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea stenoneura is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
