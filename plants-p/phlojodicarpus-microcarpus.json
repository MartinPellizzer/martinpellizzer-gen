    "intro": "Phlojodicarpus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically opposite and elliptical in shape. It produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
