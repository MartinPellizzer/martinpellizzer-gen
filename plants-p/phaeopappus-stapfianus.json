    "intro": "Phaeopappus stapfianus, commonly known as the Stapf's brown pappus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant is notable for its dark brown, fuzzy pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
