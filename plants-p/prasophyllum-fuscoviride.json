It is a perennial herb with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a spike of greenish-white flowers, which are often tinged with purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Prasophyllum fuscoviride is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
