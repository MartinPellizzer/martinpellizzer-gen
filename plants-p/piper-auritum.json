    "intro": "Piper auritum, commonly known as Mexican pepper or golden vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central America and northern South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family and is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into elliptical, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant's rapid growth and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and as a decorative plant."
