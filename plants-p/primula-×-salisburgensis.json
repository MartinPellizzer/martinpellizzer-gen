    "intro": "Primula \u00d7 salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg primrose, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet. The plant typically blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, and thrives in cool, moist environments with partial shade. Its foliage consists of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are densely arranged around the stem. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
