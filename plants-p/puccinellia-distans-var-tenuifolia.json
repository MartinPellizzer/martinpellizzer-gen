    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved saltbush, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and inland dunes. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds allow for wide distribution in harsh environments. Puccinellia distans var. tenuifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
