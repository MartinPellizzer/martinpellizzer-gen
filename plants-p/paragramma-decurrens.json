    "intro": "Paragramma decurrens, commonly known as the creeping paragramma, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a thalloid structure with a prostrate growth habit, and its leaves are often arranged in a spiral pattern. It produces spores in small, cup-like structures called sporophytes, which are typically located at the tips of the leafy shoots. Paragramma decurrens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
