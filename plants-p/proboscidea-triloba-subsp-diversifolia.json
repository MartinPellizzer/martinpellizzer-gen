    "intro": "Proboscidea triloba subsp. diversifolia, commonly known as the three-lobed proboscidea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
