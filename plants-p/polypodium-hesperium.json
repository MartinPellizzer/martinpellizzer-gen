    "intro": "Polypodium hesperium, commonly known as the western wall fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated edge. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polypodium hesperium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
