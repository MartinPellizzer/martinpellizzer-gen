    "intro": "Phragmipedium besseae f. flavum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered phragmipedium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant inflorescences bearing showy, yellow-orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
