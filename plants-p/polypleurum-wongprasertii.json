    "intro": "Polypleurum wongprasertii, commonly known as the Thai fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival."
