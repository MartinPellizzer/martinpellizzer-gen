    "intro": "Pleurothallis anthurioides, commonly known as the \"arrowhead orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling the shape of an arrowhead. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
