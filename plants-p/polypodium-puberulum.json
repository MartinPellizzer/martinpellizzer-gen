    "intro": "Polypodium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually divided into a series of lance-shaped segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
