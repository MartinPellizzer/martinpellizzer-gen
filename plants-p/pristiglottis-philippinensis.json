    "intro": "Pristiglottis philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a flattened, ribbon-like body called a thallus. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the upper surface of the thallus. Pristiglottis philippinensis plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its native habitat."
