    "intro": "Pitcairnia cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andean cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a common adaptation among bromeliads. The plant produces inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white trichomes, which help in water retention and light reflection. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
