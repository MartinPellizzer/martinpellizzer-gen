    "intro": "Polygonum bistorta var. cordifolia, commonly known as heartleaf bistort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, rhizomatous growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and slightly serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine for its purported health properties."
