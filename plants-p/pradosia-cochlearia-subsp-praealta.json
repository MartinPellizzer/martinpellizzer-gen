    "intro": "Pradosia cochlearia subsp. praealta, commonly known as the tall pradosia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
