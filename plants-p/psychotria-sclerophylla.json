    "intro": "Psychotria sclerophylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, pubescent layer. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are clustered in cymes, attracting various pollinators. Psychotria sclerophylla is also known for its potential pharmacological properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its medicinal applications."
