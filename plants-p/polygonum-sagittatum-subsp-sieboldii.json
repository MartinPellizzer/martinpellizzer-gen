    "intro": "Polygonum sagittatum subsp. sieboldii, commonly known as the arrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and North America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
