It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate watering. Pilea purpurella is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
