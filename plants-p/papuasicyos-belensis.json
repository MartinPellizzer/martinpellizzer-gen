It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into edible fruits, which are often consumed by local communities. Papuasicyos belensis is adapted to coastal and tropical environments, thriving in sandy soils and high humidity. Its ecological importance lies in its role as both a food source and a habitat for various island species."
