    "intro": "Plantago coronopus var. ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant is characterized by its rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. Its scientific name reflects its distinct horn-like structures on the leaves, which are a notable botanical feature. This variant is closely related to other species in the Plantago genus, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
