    "intro": "Pilostyles globosa var. caymanensis, commonly known as the Cayman Islands ghost flower, is a unique parasitic plant native to the Cayman Islands. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other vegetation. The plant produces striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. It is notable for its ephemeral nature, with flowers often wilting by midday. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
