    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, compressed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that are usually green to reddish in color. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
