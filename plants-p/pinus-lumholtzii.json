    "intro": "Pinus lumholtzii, commonly known as the Mexican bristlecone pine, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. The tree produces distinctive blue-green needles that are bundled in clusters of five, and its cones are small and often persist on the branches for many years. Pinus lumholtzii is known for its longevity and is often found in association with other high-altitude conifers in its native habitat. Its ecological role is significant in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various mountain species."
