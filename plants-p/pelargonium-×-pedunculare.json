    "intro": "Pelargonium \u00d7 pedunculare, commonly known as the ivy-leaved geranium, is a hybrid species within the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, slightly lobed leaves that resemble ivy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
