    "intro": "Pedicularis mussotii var. mutata, commonly known as the yellow monkey orchid, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of southern China. This herbaceous perennial features striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive hooded shape. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its flowers for photosynthesis. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
