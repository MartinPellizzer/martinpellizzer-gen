It features fleshy, upright stems covered in small, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months.

Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun make it a hardy and resilient plant for gardeners in arid climates."
