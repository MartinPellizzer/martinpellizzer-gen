    "intro": "Polygonum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive knotweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, streambanks, and roadside areas. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a reddish tint, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. Polygonum decipiens is often mistaken for other Polygonum species due to its similar appearance, which has led to its common name."
