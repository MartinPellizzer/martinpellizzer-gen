    "intro": "Polygonum densiflorum var. imberbe, commonly known as the woolly knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its tactile texture. The flowers are small and clustered, often producing a pink to reddish hue, which attracts various pollinators."
