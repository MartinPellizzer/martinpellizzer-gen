It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
