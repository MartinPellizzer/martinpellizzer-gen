    "intro": "Phyllanthus graveolens subsp. novogalicianus, commonly known as the Galician spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, bead-like capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in forested or open hillside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
