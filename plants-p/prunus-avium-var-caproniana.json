    "intro": "Prunus avium var. caproniana, commonly known as the Capronian cherry, is a lesser-known variant of the sweet cherry. It is characterized by its small, dark red fruits that are typically smaller than the standard Prunus avium. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense foliage and thorny branches. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than commercial fruit production."
