It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble a cat's tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
