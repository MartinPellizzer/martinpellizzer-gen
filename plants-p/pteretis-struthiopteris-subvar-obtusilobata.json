    "intro": "Pteretis struthiopteris subvar. obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds with rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
