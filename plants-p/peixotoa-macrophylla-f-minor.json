    "intro": "Peixotoa macrophylla f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf peixotoa, is a unique variant of the peixotoa genus native to specific regions of Brazil. This plant is characterized by its smaller stature compared to the typical form, with reduced leaf size and shorter stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it benefits from high humidity and indirect light. The leaves are typically broad and glossy, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other members of the genus. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
