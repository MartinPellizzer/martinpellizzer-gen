    "intro": "Panicum implicatum, commonly known as the curly panicgrass, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to disturbed soils and full sun conditions. Panicum implicatum is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along the edges of forests."
