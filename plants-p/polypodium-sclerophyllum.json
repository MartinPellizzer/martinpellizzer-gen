    "intro": "Polypodium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved polypody, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its dense foliage makes it a valuable ground cover in horticultural settings."
