    "intro": "Phagnalon saxatile subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rock phagnalon, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on slopes, showing a preference for well-drained, calcareous soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
