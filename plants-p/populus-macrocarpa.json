    "intro": "Populus macrocarpa, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open areas. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Populus macrocarpa thrives in moist soils and is often found near rivers and streams."
