    "intro": "Poa hitchcockiana, commonly known as Hitchcock's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Hitchcock's bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
