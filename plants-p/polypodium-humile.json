    "intro": "Polypodium humile, commonly known as the small fern or the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated edge. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
