    "intro": "Potentilla pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
