    "intro": "Polypodium grandifolium, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
