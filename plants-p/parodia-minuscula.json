    "intro": "Parodia minuscula, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to southern Africa. It features a dense covering of white to pale yellow spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in summer. It is a succulent, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
