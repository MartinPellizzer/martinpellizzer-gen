    "intro": "Piper caparonum, commonly known as the Caparonum pepper or wild pepper, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes many species of pepper plants. The plant produces small, elongated berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. These berries contain capsaicinoids, giving them a spicy flavor, though they are not as intensely hot as chili peppers. Piper caparonum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
