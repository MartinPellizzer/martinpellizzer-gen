    "intro": "Pinus parviflora var. morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison Island pine, is a rare and endemic variant of the Japanese white pine. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more clustered than those of the typical Pinus parviflora. The cones are small and often remain closed for extended periods, a trait that helps protect the seeds from environmental stress. This variety thrives in specific microclimates, typically on rocky soils in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
