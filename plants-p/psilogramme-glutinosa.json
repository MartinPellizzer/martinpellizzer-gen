    "intro": "Psilogramme glutinosa, commonly known as sticky psilogramme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its fibrous roots and succulent, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Psilogramme glutinosa is valued for its edible leaves, which are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
