It is characterized by its striking orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows from 6 to 12 inches tall, with hairy, branching stems and alternate leaves. Its scientific name, Physaria, refers to the structure of its fruit, which is a capsule containing numerous seeds. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
