    "intro": "Pteris brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately divided with serrated margins, and it produces spores in sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Pteris brevipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
