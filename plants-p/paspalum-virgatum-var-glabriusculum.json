    "intro": "Paspalum virgatum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the smooth paspalum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and pond edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
