    "intro": "Philodendron rigidifolium subsp. sanctae-ritae, commonly known as the San Cristobal philodendron, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking red bracts that encase its small, white flowers, making it a visually appealing specimen. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a prized addition to tropical plant collections."
