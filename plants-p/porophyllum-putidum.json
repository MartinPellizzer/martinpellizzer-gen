    "intro": "Porophyllum putidum, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Porophyllum putidum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
