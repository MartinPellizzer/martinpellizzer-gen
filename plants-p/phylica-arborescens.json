    "intro": "Phylica arborescens, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and produces clusters of small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Phylica arborescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine."
