    "intro": "Pandanus tectorius var. pedunculatus, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a dense, cylindrical structure, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spiky inflorescences, typically at the top of the plant. Its fibrous leaves are used in traditional thatching and basket weaving, making it economically important in some regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in coastal and humid environments."
