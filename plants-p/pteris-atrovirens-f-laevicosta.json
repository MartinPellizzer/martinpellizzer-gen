    "intro": "Pteris atrovirens f. laevicosta, commonly known as the smooth-ribbed water fern, is a fern species characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture on the underside, distinguishing it from other varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as ponds or streams. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and help in its propagation through vegetative means. Its foliage provides a dense, lush appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
