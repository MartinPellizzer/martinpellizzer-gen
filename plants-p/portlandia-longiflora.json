    "intro": "Portlandia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive lip. Portlandia longiflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
