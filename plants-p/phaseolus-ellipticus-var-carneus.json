    "intro": "Phaseolus ellipticus var. carneus, commonly known as the pink runner bean, is a tropical legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flower clusters and elongated, elliptical pods that mature to a vibrant red or orange color. The plant is an annual vine that can grow up to 6 meters in length, with trifoliate leaves and hairy stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The seeds are typically harvested when the pods are fully mature and dry, making it a valuable crop for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
