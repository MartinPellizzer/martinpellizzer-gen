    "intro": "Prasium minus, commonly known as the lesser prasium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Prasium minus is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects."
