    "intro": "Psychotria cristata, commonly known as the crowned psychotria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a crown, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense, branching clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Psychotria cristata is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
