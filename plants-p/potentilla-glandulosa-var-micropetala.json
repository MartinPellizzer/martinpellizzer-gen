    "intro": "Potentilla glandulosa var. micropetala, commonly known as the dwarf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
