It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a slow-growing plant that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
