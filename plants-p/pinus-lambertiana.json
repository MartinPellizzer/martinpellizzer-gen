It is characterized by its long, slender needles and distinctive, often drooping cones. The tree can grow up to 200 feet tall and has a trunk that can reach diameters of over 5 feet. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against forest fires. The sugar pine is also notable for its large, edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species."
