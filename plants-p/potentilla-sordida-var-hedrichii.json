    "intro": "Potentilla sordida var. hedrichii, commonly known as the dark potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late summer, which are relatively inconspicuous compared to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
