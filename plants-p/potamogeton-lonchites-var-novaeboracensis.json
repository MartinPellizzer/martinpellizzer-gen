    "intro": "Potamogeton lonchites var. novaeboracensis, commonly known as the New York pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has long, slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are usually submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its dense growth helps stabilize sediments and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
