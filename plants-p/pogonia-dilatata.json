    "intro": "Pogonia dilatata, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a striking orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pouch-like lip that is often brightly colored, typically in shades of pink or red. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Pogonia dilatata is considered a threatened species in many areas."
