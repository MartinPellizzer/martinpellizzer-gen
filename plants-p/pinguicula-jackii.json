    "intro": "Pinguicula jackii, commonly known as the Jack's butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually small and bilaterally symmetrical, often in shades of purple or pink. Pinguicula jackii is notable for its ability to absorb nutrients from captured prey, adapting to nutrient-poor habitats."
