The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
