    "intro": "Potentilla salisburgensis var. praeruptorum, commonly known as the Salzburg cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to rocky and grassy slopes. The plant has slender, hairy stems and dark green, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, cliffs, and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
