It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a distinctive, spurred appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring.
