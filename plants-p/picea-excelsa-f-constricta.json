    "intro": "Picea excelsa f. constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf white spruce, is a botanical variant of the white spruce species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated needles and constricted leaf bases, distinguishing it from the typical form. This subspecies is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant exhibits a coniferous growth habit, forming dense, evergreen trees with a pyramidal shape. Its foliage provides habitat for various alpine fauna, contributing to the ecological balance of its mountainous habitat."
