    "intro": "Pancratium moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's torchflower, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces tall, slender stems topped with vibrant orange or red flowers that resemble torches, blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a fibrous root system and thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dramatic, showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and birds."
