    "intro": "Phyllodesmis kaempferi, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats, due to its specialized adaptations for salt tolerance. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding in survival in arid or brackish conditions. Its root system includes pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
