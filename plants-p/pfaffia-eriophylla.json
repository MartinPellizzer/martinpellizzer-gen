    "intro": "Pfaffia eriophylla, commonly known as golden cupid, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Pfaffia eriophylla is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
