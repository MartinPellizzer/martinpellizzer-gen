    "intro": "Panax laciniatus, commonly known as the Chinese ginseng or notoginseng, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbellate clusters, followed by dark red to black berries containing multiple seeds. Its roots are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Panax laciniatus is now considered an endangered species."
