    "intro": "Pteris peucedanifolia, commonly known as the peucedanifolia water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Pteris peucedanifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
