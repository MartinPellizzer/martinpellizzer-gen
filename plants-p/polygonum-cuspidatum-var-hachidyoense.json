    "intro": "Polygonum cuspidatum var. hachidyoense, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
