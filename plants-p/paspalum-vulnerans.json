    "intro": "Paspalum vulnerans, commonly known as the wounded grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance. Paspalum vulnerans is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
