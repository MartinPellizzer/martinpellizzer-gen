    "intro": "Protium divaricatum, commonly known as the West Indian satinwood, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
