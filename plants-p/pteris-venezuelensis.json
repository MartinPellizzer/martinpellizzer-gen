    "intro": "Pteris venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are protected by a thin, papery covering. Pteris venezuelensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
