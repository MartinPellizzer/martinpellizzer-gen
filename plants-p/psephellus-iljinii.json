    "intro": "Psephellus iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's psephellus, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Psephellus iljinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
