    "intro": "Primula minima var. multidentata, commonly known as the miniature primrose, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to bloom in early spring. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
