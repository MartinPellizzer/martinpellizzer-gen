    "intro": "Primula fagosa, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers, typically pink or white, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Primula fagosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in high-altitude ecosystems."
