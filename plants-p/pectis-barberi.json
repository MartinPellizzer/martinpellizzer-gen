    "intro": "Pectis barberi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Pectis barberi is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
