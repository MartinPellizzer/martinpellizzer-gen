    "intro": "Panax balfourii, commonly known as the Balfour ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are typically consumed by birds and other animals. Its roots, similar to other ginseng species, are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
