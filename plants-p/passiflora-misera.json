    "intro": "Passiflora misera, commonly known as the miserable passionflower, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a crown of filaments and a central cluster of stamens. The plant produces blue or purple berries that are edible but often have a bland or slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Passiflora misera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
