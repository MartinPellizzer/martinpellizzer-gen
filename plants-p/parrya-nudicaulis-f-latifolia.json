It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
