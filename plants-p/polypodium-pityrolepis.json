    "intro": "Polypodium pityrolepis, commonly known as the rock fern or cliff fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiales order. Polypodium pityrolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
