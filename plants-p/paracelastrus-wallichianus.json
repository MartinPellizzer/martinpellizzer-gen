    "intro": "Paracelastrus wallichianus, commonly known as the Himalayan ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, dark-barked trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for certain bird species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
