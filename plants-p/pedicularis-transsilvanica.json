    "intro": "Pedicularis transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly Romania and the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in open woodlands or meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
