    "intro": "Pteridium aquilinum subsp. lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy bracken, is a fern species characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This subspecies is often found in forest understories and is notable for its ecological resilience."
