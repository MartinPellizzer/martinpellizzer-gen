    "intro": "Panicum dichotomum var. commune, commonly known as the common dichotomous grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often pubescent. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
