    "intro": "Philodendron swartzianum, commonly known as the Swartz's philodendron, is a climbing perennial vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Philodendron swartzianum is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
