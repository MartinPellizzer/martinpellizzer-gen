    "intro": "Parnassia foliosa subsp. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its showy, white, cup-shaped flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
