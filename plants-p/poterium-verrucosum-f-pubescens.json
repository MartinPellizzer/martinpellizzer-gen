    "intro": "Poterium verrucosum f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blister grass, is a variant of the blister grass species characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage. It is a perennial plant native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, contributing to its grass-like appearance. The hairy texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
