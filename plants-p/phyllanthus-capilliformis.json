    "intro": "Phyllanthus capilliformis, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Phyllanthus capilliformis is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
