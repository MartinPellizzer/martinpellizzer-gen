It is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of pink and white. The plant has elliptical leaves that are serrated, giving it the species name \"serrulata.\" It produces small, yellow fruits called cherries, which are edible but not as commonly consumed as those of other Prunus species. The tree is highly valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in Japan."
