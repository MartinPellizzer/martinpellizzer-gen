    "intro": "Pandanus gibbsianus, commonly known as the giant pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are often covered in small, fragrant flowers. Its roots system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in wet, coastal environments. The plant is often used in traditional crafts and has cultural significance in many island communities."
