    "intro": "Polystemma mirandae, commonly known as the Miranda's polystemma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Polystichaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like appearance with delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Polystemma mirandae is considered a botanically significant and ecologically vulnerable species."
