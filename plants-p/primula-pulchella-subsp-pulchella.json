    "intro": "Primula pulchella subsp. pulchella, commonly known as the showy primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow. The leaves are broad, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forested areas at high elevations. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms."
