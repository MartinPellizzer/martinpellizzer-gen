    "intro": "Protasparagus graniticus, commonly known as the granite asparagus, is a rare and hardy plant adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
