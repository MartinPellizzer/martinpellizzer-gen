    "intro": "Pseudolithos sphaericus, commonly known as the spherical rock plant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth of small, rounded, fleshy leaves that form a compact, rock-like appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance due to its succulent nature. Its leaves are typically green with a slight bluish tint, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. Pseudolithos sphaericus is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
