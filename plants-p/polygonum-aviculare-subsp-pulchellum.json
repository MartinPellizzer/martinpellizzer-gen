    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare subsp. pulchellum, commonly known as the pretty knotgrass, is a flowering plant in the buckwheat family (Polygonaceae). It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and produce tiny, greenish-white flowers that are not showy but are important for pollinators. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
