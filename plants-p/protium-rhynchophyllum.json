    "intro": "Protium rhynchophyllum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, round fruits that contain a single seed. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
