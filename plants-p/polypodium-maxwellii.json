    "intro": "Polypodium maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's huperzia, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium maxwellii is also notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient and adaptable species."
