    "intro": "Potentilla concinniformis var. obovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters of five. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
