    "intro": "Pellaea wrightiana var. longimucronata, commonly known as the long-tipped rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a distinct, elongated apical spur that gives the variety its name. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
