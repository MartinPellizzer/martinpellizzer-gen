It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its compact form and seasonal interest."
