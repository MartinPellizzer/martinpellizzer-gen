    "intro": "Phalaris ciliaris, commonly known as silky grass or soft grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silky-textured leaves that give it a soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
