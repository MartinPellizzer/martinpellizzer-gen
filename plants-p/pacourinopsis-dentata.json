    "intro": "Pacourinopsis dentata, commonly known as the toothed pacourinopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with serrated margins and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
