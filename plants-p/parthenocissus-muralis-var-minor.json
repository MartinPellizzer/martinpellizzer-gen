    "intro": "Parthenocissus muralis var. minor, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens and structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Its tendrils allow it to cling to walls and trellises, making it suitable for vertical gardening. The varietal form 'minor' is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other Parthenocissus species."
