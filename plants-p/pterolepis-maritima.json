    "intro": "Pterolepis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing along shores and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss and protect against salt spray. Pterolepis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
