    "intro": "Pteris tokioi var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Japan. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant grows in a rosette form, with the fronds arching outward from a central point. It prefers shady, moist environments and is well-suited for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its fine, lacy foliage and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
