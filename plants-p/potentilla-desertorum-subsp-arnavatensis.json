    "intro": "Potentilla desertorum subsp. arnavatensis, commonly known as the Navarre potentilla, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
