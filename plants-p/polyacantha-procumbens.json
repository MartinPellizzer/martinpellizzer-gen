    "intro": "Polyacantha procumbens, commonly known as the creeping polyacantha, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover in arid or semi-arid landscapes."
