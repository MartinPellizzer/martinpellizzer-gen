    "intro": "Pinus coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf pine, is a coniferous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other pine species. The tree produces cones that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing some protection against fire and insect damage. The narrowleaf pine is well adapted to acidic, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
