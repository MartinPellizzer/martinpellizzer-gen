    "intro": "Potamogeton oblongus var. ovato-oblongus, commonly known as the broad-oblong pondweed, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It has long, narrow, ovate-oblong leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne in spikes, and it is often found in shallow, slow-moving waters. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, contributing to aquatic ecosystem structure. This species plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
