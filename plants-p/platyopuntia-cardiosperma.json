    "intro": "Platyopuntia cardiosperma, commonly known as the cardiosperma prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well-suited for desert conditions."
