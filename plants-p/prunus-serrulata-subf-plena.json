    "intro": "Prunus serrulata subf. plena, commonly known as the Japanese cherry blossom or Yamazakura, is a cultivar of the Japanese cherry tree. It is characterized by its double flowers, which are more showy and fragrant than those of the typical Prunus serrulata. The plant is native to Japan and is widely cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly during the spring blossom season. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial sunlight. The flowers are often used in cultural celebrations and are a symbol of renewal and the transient beauty of life."
