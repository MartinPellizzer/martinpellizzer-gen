    "intro": "Psychotria gatunensis, commonly known as the Gatun Psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically consumed by various bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
