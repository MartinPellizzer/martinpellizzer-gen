    "intro": "Phelipanche olbiensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular, violet or white flowers that bloom in the early morning. It is known for its ability to germinate in response to root exudates from neighboring plants, a trait that aids in its parasitic growth. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a weed in some regions, particularly in agricultural settings."
