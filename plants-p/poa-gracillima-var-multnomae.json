    "intro": "Poa gracillima var. multnomae, commonly known as the Cascade mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forested areas. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in sensitive ecosystems."
