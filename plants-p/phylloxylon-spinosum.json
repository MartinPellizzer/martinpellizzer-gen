    "intro": "Phylloxylon spinosum, commonly known as the spiny wood or spiny phylloxylon, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, and it relies on insect pollination. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Phylloxylon spinosum is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
