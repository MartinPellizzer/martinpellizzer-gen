    "intro": "Paronychia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Paronychia saxatilis is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
