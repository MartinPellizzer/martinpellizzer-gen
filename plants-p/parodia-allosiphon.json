It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white or yellow spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
