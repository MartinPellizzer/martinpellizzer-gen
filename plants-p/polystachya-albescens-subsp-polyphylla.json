    "intro": "Polystachya albescens subsp. polyphylla, commonly known as the white-veined bamboo orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and large, pale green leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
