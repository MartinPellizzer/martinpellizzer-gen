    "intro": "Prasophyllum dossenum, commonly known as the Dorrigo leek orchid, is an endemic orchid species native to the subtropical rainforests of eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single spike of pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers are characterized by their narrow, tubular shape and lack of a distinct lip. Prasophyllum dossenum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
