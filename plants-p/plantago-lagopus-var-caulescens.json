    "intro": "Plantago lagopus var. caulescens, commonly known as the common plantain, is a variant of the greater plantain, characterized by its upright growth habit and dense rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of small, greenish flowers that develop into capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss and provide insulation. The species is known for its medicinal properties, with leaves traditionally used to treat wounds, inflammation, and digestive issues."
