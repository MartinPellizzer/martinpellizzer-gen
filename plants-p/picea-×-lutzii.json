    "intro": "Picea \u00d7 lutzii, commonly known as the Lutz spruce, is a hybrid conifer resulting from the cross between Picea abies and Picea omorika. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the coniferous family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This species is relatively cold-hardy and can tolerate a range of soil conditions."
