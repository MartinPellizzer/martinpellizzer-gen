    "intro": "Paphiopedilum stonei f. luteoalbum, commonly known as the Yellow White Lady's Slipper, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is typically yellow to white in color, giving it its common name. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and horticultural value, it is often cultivated in specialized collections."
