The fruit is typically elongated, with a smooth, bluish-purple skin that becomes darker as it ripens. It produces a sweet, aromatic pulp with a high sugar content and a mild tartness. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers in spring. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible fruit."
