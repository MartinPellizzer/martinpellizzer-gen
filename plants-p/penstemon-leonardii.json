    "intro": "Penstemon leonardii, commonly known as Leonard's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Penstemon leonardii is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
