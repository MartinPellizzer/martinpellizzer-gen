    "intro": "Pellaea arsenii, commonly known as the arsenic fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern. Pellaea arsenii thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
