    "intro": "Philodendron yavitense, commonly known as the Yav\u00ed Yav\u00ed, is a tropical climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often bright green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a less commonly cultivated species among philodendrons."
