    "intro": "Panicum plicatile var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces slender spikes of small, pale green to golden florets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful form and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
