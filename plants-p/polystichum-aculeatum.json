    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polystichum aculeatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
