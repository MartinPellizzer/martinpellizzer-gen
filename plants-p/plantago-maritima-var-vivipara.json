    "intro": "Plantago maritima var. vivipara, commonly known as sea plantain or seaside plantain, is a variant of the common plantain that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into capsules containing numerous seeds. One of its notable features is the production of viviparous structures, which are seedlings that germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to colonize harsh coastal habitats effectively."
