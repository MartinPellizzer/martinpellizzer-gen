    "intro": "Pseudellipanthus, commonly known as the false sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their small, showy flowers. They typically grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The leaves are usually simple and opposite, with a hairy texture. Pseudellipanthus species are often found in disturbed soils and can be used in ecological restoration projects due to their hardy nature."
