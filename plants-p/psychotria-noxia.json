    "intro": "Psychotria noxia, commonly known as the poison arrow vine, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly psychotridine, which contributes to its toxic properties. Psychotria noxia is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
