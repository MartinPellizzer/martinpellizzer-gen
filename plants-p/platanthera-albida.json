    "intro": "Platanthera albida, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, white to pale green inflorescence that resembles a tresses of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
