    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris f. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf Scots pine, is a compact form of the Scots pine, characterized by its shorter, more densely packed needles and reduced branch growth. It is a natural variant that typically grows in harsh environments such as rocky soils or high altitudes, where its compact structure provides better protection against wind and cold. The foliage is dark green, with needles that are shorter and stiffer compared to the typical Scots pine. This form exhibits a unique morphology that makes it distinct from the standard species, often forming a rounded or cushion-like shape. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and resilience in challenging conditions."
