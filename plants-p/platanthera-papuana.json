    "intro": "Platanthera papuana, commonly known as the Papuan marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
