    "intro": "Pimpinella acronemifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to theApiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which disperse via wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
