    "intro": "Pandanus funicularis, commonly known as the beach pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing at the top of the plant. Pandanus funicularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various species."
