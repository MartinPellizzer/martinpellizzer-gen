    "intro": "Phyllorkis bulbophylli, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring a single, waxy leaf and a striking, pale pink or white flower with a distinctive, ghost-like shape. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, Phyllorkis bulbophylli is considered endangered, prompting conservation efforts to protect this rare botanical treasure."
