It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a dense inflorescence. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape region, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
