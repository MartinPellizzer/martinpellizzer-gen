    "intro": "Panicum stagnatile, commonly known as swamp panicum, is a herbaceous perennial grass native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It typically grows in marshy areas, along riverbanks, and in other moist environments where water levels fluctuate. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, and its leaves are narrow and often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
