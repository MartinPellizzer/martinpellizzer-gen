    "intro": "Petalostigma quadriloculare var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-fruited petalostigma, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its quadrilocular fruits, which are four-chambered capsules containing numerous small seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth surface, and it produces showy, pinkish-white flowers during the wet season. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of the species."
