    "intro": "Pleopeltis montigena, commonly known as the Montigena rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Pleopeltis montigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
