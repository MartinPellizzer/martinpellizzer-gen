    "intro": "Paepalanthus retusus, commonly known as the hairy pincushion cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus characterized by its dense clusters of spiny, woolly stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments. Paepalanthus retusus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
