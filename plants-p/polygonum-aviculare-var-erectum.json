    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare var. erectum, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or erect growth habit. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along pathways. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a common weed and a resilient plant in various habitats."
