    "intro": "Pteris maissonieri, commonly known as the French maid fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
