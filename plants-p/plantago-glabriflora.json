    "intro": "Plantago glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered plantain, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are often obscured by the leaves. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various insects and wildlife."
