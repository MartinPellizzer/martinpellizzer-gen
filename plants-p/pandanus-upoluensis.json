The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody, spiky fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The Upolu pandanus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is valued for its ornamental and cultural significance."
