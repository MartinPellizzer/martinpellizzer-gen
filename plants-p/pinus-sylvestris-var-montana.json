    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris var. montana, commonly known as the Swiss stone pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the Alps and other mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dense, needle-like foliage that is typically bluish-green in color. The cones of this plant are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in forestry and as a source of resin."
