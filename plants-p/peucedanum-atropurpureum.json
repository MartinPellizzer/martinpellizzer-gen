It features erect, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are schizocarps, each containing two mericarps that separate at maturity. The plant is valued for its aromatic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
