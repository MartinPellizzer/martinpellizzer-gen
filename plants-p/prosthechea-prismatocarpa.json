    "intro": "Prosthechea prismatocarpa, commonly known as the prism-fruit orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often ribbed pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, during the rainy season. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to capture moisture from the air. The fruit is a fleshy, segmented capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the humid forest canopy."
