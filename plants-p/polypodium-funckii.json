    "intro": "Polypodium funckii, commonly known as the Funck's shield fern, is a species of polypody found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Polypodium funckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
