    "intro": "Polyalthia vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Fiji. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
