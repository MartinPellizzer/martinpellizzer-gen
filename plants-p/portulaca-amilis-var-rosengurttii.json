    "intro": "Portulaca amilis var. rosengurttii, commonly known as the Rosengurtt's moss rose, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green or red in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom during the day and close at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in dry climates."
