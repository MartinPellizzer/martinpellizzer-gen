    "intro": "Polygala peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and delicate, often yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Polygala peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
