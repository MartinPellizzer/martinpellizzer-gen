    "intro": "Poacynum russanovii, commonly known as the Russian death cap, is a strikingly poisonous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains potent cardiac glycosides, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is considered one of the most dangerous plants in its native habitat."
