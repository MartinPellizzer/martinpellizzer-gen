    "intro": "Panicum pyramidale var. quadrifarium, commonly known as the four-leaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, fluffy seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy ornamental grass for gardens and landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense clumps make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
