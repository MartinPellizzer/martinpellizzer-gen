It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped, violet or blue flowers that open in the morning. The plant is native to East Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a popular garden plant and a potential weed."
