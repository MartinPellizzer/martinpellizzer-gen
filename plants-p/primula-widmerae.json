    "intro": "Primula widmerae, commonly known as the Widmer's primrose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
