    "intro": "Pachystigma solitariiflorum, commonly known as the solitary-flowered pachystigma, is a unique member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is a bulbous plant native to South Africa, characterized by its striking, large, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its bulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to support growth during dry periods. Pachystigma solitariiflorum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
