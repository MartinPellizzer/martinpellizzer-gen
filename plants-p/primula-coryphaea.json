    "intro": "Primula coryphaea, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Primula coryphaea plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to alpine biodiversity."
