    "intro": "Pritchardia aylmer-robinsonii, commonly known as the Aylmer-Robinson pisonia, is a species of cycad native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
