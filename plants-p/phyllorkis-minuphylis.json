It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps anchor it to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. This fern is typically found in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its preference for humid, temperate climates."
