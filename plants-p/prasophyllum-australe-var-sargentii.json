    "intro": "Prasophyllum australe var. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's leek orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained sandy or loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
