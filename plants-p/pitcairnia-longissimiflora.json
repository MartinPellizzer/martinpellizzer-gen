    "intro": "Pitcairnia longissimiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered pitcairnia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and dense clusters of long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, which help to retain moisture in its humid habitat. This species is well-suited for shaded, indoor environments and is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts."
