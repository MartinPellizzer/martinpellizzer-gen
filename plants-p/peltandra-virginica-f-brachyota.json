    "intro": "Peltandra virginica f. brachyota, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white, arrowhead-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
