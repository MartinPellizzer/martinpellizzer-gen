It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, though the 'glabra' variety is hairless. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
