    "intro": "Paragymnopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the two-pinnate cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are divided into two levels of pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat."
