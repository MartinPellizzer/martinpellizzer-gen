    "intro": "Poa perennis, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green blades that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Poa perennis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and fine texture."
