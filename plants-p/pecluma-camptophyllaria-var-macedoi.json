    "intro": "Pecluma camptophyllaria var. macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian pecluma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions in the Balkans. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a woody stem and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
