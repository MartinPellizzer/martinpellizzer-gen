    "intro": "Pedicularis rex var. typica, commonly known as the royal monkey orchid, is a striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which resemble the face of a monkey. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
