    "intro": "Passaea spartioides, commonly known as sand sparrowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found on dunes and rocky shores. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, appearing in clusters during the spring. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
