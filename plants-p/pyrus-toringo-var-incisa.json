    "intro": "Pyrus toringo var. incisa, commonly known as the Japanese whitebeam, is a variant of the Japanese whitebeam species native to Japan. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional Japanese gardens. The varietal form 'incisa' is distinguished by its more pronounced leaf lobes compared to the typical variety."
