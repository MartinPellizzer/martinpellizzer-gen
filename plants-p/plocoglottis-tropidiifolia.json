    "intro": "Plocoglottis tropidiifolia, commonly known as the tropical sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with lanceolate pinnae that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Plocoglottis tropidiifolia thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories where it receives dappled sunlight."
