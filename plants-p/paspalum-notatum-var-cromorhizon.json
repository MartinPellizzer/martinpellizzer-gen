    "intro": "Paspalum notatum var. cromorhizon, commonly known as coastal paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its deep root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
