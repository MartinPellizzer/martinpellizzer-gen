    "intro": "Pandanus stellatus, commonly known as the star pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spadix, which is surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Its fibrous roots and robust structure make it well adapted to coastal and wetland environments. The star pandanus is also valued for its ornamental appearance and traditional uses in various island cultures."
