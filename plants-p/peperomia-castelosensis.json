    "intro": "Peperomia castelosensis, commonly known as the Castelo's peperomia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Brazil. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Peperomia castelosensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ease of care and attractive foliage."
