    "intro": "Potentilla pimpinelloides var. visianii, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
