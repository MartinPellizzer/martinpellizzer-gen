    "intro": "Podocarpium podocarpum, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green needles that are arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. The tree plays a vital role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for various alpine species."
