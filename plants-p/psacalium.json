    "intro": "Psacalium, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their trailing or climbing habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. They produce small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, fleshy fruits resembling cucumbers. The fruits are edible, though often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
