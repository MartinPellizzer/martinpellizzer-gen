It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often growing on trees or cliffs. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in extreme dry conditions, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh climates. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in its native habitat."
