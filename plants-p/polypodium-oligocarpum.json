    "intro": "Polypodium oligocarpum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest areas, thriving in humid environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium oligocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties."
