    "intro": "Potentilla crantzii var. latestipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cinquefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia.

The plant has compound leaves with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
