It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, fleshy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to poor, sandy soils. Physaria tenella plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
