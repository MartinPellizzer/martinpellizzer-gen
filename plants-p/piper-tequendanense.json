It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, slender stems that often twine around supporting structures. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences. The fruit is a small, berry-like drupe that turns from green to red when mature, containing a single seed."
