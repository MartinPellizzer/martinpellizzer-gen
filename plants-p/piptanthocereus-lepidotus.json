    "intro": "Piptanthocereus lepidotus, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny stem that resembles a barrel, and it produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
