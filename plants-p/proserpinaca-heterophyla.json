    "intro": "Proserpinaca heterophyla, commonly known as the slender sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a distinctive anise-like scent when crushed. Proserpinaca heterophyla plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
