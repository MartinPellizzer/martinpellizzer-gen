    "intro": "Pterophylla humblotii var. anceps, commonly known as the Humboldt's pterophylla, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
