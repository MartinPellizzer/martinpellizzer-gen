    "intro": "Polypodium subviride, commonly known as the green moss fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture. Polypodium subviride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
