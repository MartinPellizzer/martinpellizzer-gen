    "intro": "Psilochilus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf psilochilus, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
