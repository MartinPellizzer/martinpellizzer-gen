It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found growing in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for traditional herbal use."
