    "intro": "Piper cerrocampanum, commonly known as the Andean pepper or mountain pepper, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species such as black pepper. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when ripe, and they are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,000 meters."
