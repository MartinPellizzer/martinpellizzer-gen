It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the harsh climate with its low-growing habit. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
