    "intro": "Peristylus bilobus, commonly known as the two-lobed peristylus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its inflorescence consists of whorled clusters of flowers. Peristylus bilobus thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as swamps and wetlands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland environment, making it an important species in ecological studies."
