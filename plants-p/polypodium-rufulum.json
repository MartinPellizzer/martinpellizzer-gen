    "intro": "Polypodium rufulum, commonly known as the rusty polypody, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Polypodium rufulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
