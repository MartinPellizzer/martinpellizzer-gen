    "intro": "Pollinia imberbis f. monostachya, commonly known as the single-stemmed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is distinguished by its elongated, hairless pollinia, which are typically attached to a single stamen. The plant exhibits a monostachya habit, meaning it produces a single, elongated inflorescence with a series of flowers. Its botanical features are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms, often involving mycorrhizal relationships with fungi. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in certain tropical regions."
