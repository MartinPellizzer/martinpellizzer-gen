    "intro": "Patagonium humile, commonly known as the dwarf Patagonian lichen, is a small, crust-like lichen that thrives in harsh, arid environments. It is characterized by its dense, tightly packed growth form, which helps it retain moisture in extreme conditions. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is typically found in Patagonia and other high-altitude regions with strong sunlight and low humidity. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental change."
