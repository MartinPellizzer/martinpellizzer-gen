    "intro": "Pilosocereus zahrae, commonly known as the Zahra's cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators like bees and moths. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens and conservation efforts."
