    "intro": "Polypodium rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions, making it a common epiphyte in forest ecosystems."
