    "intro": "Polymnia uvedalia var. densipilis, commonly known as the dense-hairymoss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and hairy leaf surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elongated and pointed, with a distinct midrib. This moss plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
