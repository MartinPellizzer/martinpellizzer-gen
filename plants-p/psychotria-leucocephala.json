    "intro": "Psychotria leucocephala, commonly known as the white-headed psychotria, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface and a strong, often unpleasant odor. Psychotria leucocephala is also known for containing psychoactive compounds, though it is not as well-studied as other species in the genus."
