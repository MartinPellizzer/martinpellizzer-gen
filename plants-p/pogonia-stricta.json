    "intro": "Pogonia stricta, commonly known as the rigid pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant has a complex root system that helps it anchor in rich, organic soil. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and have a distinctive, intricate structure with three sepals and three petals. Pogonia stricta is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
