    "intro": "Plectrachne desertorum, commonly known as the desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Plectrachne desertorum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
