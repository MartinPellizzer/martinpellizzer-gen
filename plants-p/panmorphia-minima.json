    "intro": "Panmorphia minima, commonly known as the tiny morphing plant, is a rare and enigmatic species native to specific microhabitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate foliage and unique ability to alter its leaf morphology in response to environmental stimuli. The plant exhibits a high degree of phenotypic plasticity, which allows it to adapt to varying light and moisture conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically blooming in the early morning. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Panmorphia minima remains a subject of ongoing botanical study."
