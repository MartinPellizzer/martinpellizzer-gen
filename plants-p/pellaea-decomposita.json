    "intro": "Pellaea decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other members of the Pellaea genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's unique appearance and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
