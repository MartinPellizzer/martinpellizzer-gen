    "intro": "Poa canadensis, commonly known as Canadian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, sod-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a blue-green coloration that gives it its common name. Poa canadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
