    "intro": "Phlebophyllum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense mats on rocky or soil surfaces. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its structure includes a thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and specialized pores for gas exchange. Phlebophyllum angustifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
