    "intro": "Phymatopsis taeniata, commonly known as the narrowleaf phymatopsis, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Phymatopsis taeniata is also known for its ability to produce a toxic compound called phymatopside, which can deter herbivores."
