    "intro": "Phleum pratense f. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its unusually large size and striking floral display. This perennial grass is native to Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It features tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with large, feathery inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, white to pale green florets in clusters. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
