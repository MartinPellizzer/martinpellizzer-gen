    "intro": "Penstemon lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Penstemon lobbii is valued in gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
