    "intro": "Puya edulis, commonly known as the edible puya, is a unique plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are fibrous and used in traditional crafts, while its roots are sometimes consumed as a starchy food. Due to its ecological and cultural significance, Puya edulis is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
