    "intro": "Pachypteris multicaulis, commonly known as the thick-winged fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological research."
