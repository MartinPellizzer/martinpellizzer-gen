    "intro": "Paramanglietia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited manglietia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Magnoliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Paramanglietia microcarpa is considered a rare and endangered species."
