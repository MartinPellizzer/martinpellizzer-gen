    "intro": "Plectaneia inutilis var. latiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered plectanea, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Plectaneeae tribe. It is characterized by its broad, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
