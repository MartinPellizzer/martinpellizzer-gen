    "intro": "Pinguicula villosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered cushion liverwort, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Pinguiculaceae. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant's leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, which aids in capturing moisture and small prey. Its flowers, which are pale white to cream in color, are usually small and clustered, contributing to its unique aesthetic. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
