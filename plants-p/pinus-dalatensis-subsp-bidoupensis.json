    "intro": "Pinus dalatensis subsp. bidoupensis, commonly known as the Bidoup Pine, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude montane forests. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in bundles of five, characteristic of the pine genus. Its cones are woody and contain two-winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
