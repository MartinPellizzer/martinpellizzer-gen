It features showy, fragrant inflorescences composed of numerous white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, loose spiral. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. It relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological dependence on fungal symbiosis."
