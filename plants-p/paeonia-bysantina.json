    "intro": "Paeonia bysantina, commonly known as the Constantinople peony, is a herbaceous perennial native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It features showy, double flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are finely toothed and arranged alternately along the stems. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and allow the plant to survive harsh winters. Paeonia bysantina is valued in gardens for its ornamental beauty and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
