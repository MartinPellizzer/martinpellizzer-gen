    "intro": "Primula hirsuta subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
