    "intro": "Pyrus malus var. appiana, commonly known as the apple service tree, is a variety of the apple tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ornamental fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used in traditional medicine. The plant features a rounded canopy with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production."
