    "intro": "Prosthechea gilbertoi, commonly known as the Gilbert's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and aerial roots, allowing it to attach to trees and absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Prosthechea gilbertoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, well-lit environment."
