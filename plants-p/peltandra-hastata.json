    "intro": "Peltandra hastata, commonly known as the arrowleaf yucca, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or yellow veins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. Peltandra hastata is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in dry, open habitats."
