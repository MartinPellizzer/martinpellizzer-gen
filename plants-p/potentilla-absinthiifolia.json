    "intro": "Potentilla absinthiifolia, commonly known as silverleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
