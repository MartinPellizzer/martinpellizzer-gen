It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. The species is notable for its morphological variability and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in alpine ecosystems."
