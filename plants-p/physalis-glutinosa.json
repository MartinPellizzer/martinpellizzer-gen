    "intro": "Physalis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange fruits that are encased in a papery calyx. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into the distinctive, sticky fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The fruit is edible when fully ripe, though it has a tangy, acidic flavor."
