It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pradosia mutisii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
