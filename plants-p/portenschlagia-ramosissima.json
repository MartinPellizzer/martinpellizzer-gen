    "intro": "Portenschlagia ramosissima, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Portenschlagia ramosissima plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of resilience in desert ecosystems."
