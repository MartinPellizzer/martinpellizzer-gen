It features rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Pavetta globularis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
