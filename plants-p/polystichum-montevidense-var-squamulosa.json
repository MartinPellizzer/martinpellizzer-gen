    "intro": "Polystichum montevidense var. squamulosa, commonly known as the scalloped wood fern, is a variant of the Montevidense wood fern native to South America. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a tall, upright rhizome with fronds that have a distinctive scalloped or wavy margin. Its leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. The varietal form is characterized by its unique, scaly appearance on the fronds, which distinguishes it from other members of the Polystichum genus."
