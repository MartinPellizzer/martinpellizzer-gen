    "intro": "Phloga polystachya, commonly known as the golden club, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, broad leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments. Phloga polystachya is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds where the soil remains consistently saturated."
