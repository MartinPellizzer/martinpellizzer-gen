It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Plectronia subcordatifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to flourish."
