    "intro": "Pithecellobium circinale, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant produces yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, oval leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. The fruit is a flattened pod that contains edible seeds, though the plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities in soil enrichment."
