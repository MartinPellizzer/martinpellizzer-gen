It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Polygonum rosellum is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides, ditches, and wet meadows."
