    "intro": "Passiflora hypoglauca, commonly known as the white passionflower, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking white and green flowers, which feature a unique structure with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients and often consumed fresh or in jams. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and tend to climb by means of tendrils. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming effects."
