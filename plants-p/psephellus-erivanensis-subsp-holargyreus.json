    "intro": "Psephellus erivanensis subsp. holargyreus, commonly known as the Erivan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
