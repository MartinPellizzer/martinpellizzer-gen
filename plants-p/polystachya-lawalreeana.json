It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that resembles a ghostly silhouette, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of ghostly figures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree bark or among leaf litter in the rainforest. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
