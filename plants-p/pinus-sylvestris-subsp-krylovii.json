    "intro": "Pinus sylvestris subsp. krylovii, commonly known as the Siberian pine, is a subspecies of the Scots pine native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of the typical Scots pine. The cones of this subspecies are often larger and more robust, with thick, scaly scales that protect the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil quality. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often used in reforestation efforts in its native range."
