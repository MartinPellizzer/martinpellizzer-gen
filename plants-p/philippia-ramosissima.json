It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and bright red stems that stand out against its green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
