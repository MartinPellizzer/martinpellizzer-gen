It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which attract various pollinators. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in harsh conditions."
