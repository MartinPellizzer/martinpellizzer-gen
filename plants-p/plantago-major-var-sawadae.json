    "intro": "Plantago major var. sawadae, commonly known as the Japanese plantain, is a variant of the common plantain, characterized by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia, particularly Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. This variant is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
