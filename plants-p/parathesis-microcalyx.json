    "intro": "Parathesis microcalyx, commonly known as the small-calyx bladderwort, is a type of aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive calyx that is smaller than the petals. The species is known for its specialized adaptations for aquatic life and nutrient acquisition through carnivory."
