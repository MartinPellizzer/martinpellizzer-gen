    "intro": "Phlegmariurus shingianus, commonly known as the Shingian moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a dorsiventral thallus that is green and covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces through spores, which are released from capsules that develop on the upper surface of the thallus. This species is often used in ecological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its role in soil stabilization."
