    "intro": "Paspalum caulescens, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and riparian zones. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often leafless above the base, with long, narrow leaves that are slightly folded. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Paspalum caulescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
