    "intro": "Peristylus cryptostylus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slender stem and striking, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant lacks leaves, relying instead on its elongated stem for photosynthesis, which makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Its habitat is typically in shaded, swampy areas, where it forms a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Peristylus cryptostylus is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation efforts."
