    "intro": "Polypodium marginatum, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a pale margin. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common in ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
