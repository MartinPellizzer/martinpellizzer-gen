    "intro": "Pterocarpus, commonly known as the kingwood or ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. The leaves are typically pinnate, and the flowers are often yellow or orange, attracting pollinators. The plant's fruit is a legume pod containing flat, seed-like structures called pterocarps."
