    "intro": "Prasophyllum morrisii var. intermedium, commonly known as the Intermediate Leek Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and produces a tall flowering stem that bears a single, slender spike of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils within open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a short-lived perennial, with a flowering period generally occurring in late winter to early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
