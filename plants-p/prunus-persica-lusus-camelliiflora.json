    "intro": "Prunus persica lusus camelliiflora, commonly known as the camellia-flowered peach, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both peach and camellia species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions with temperate climates. The plant produces showy, camellia-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. The fruit, although similar in shape to a peach, is often smaller and less commonly cultivated for its edible qualities."
