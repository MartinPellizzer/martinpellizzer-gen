    "intro": "Psoralea trullata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed psoralea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves with narrow, linear leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, a common mechanism in the Fabaceae family. Psoralea trullata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
