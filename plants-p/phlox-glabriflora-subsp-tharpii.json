    "intro": "Phlox glabriflora subsp. tharpii, commonly known as the Tharpii phlox, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) floral tubes and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of *P. glabriflora*. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
