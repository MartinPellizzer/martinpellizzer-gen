    "intro": "Potentilla arenaria f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its silver-green, narrow, and often hairy leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is distinguished by its lighter leaf color compared to the typical form of Potentilla arenaria."
