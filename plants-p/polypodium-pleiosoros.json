    "intro": "Polypodium pleiosoros, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
