    "intro": "Poa lobata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Poa lobata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand drought conditions."
