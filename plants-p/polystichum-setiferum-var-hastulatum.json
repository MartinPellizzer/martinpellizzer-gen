    "intro": "Polystichum setiferum var. hastulatum, commonly known as the Hart's Tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are dark green and often have a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. This variety is noted for its slow growth and ability to form dense, compact clumps over time."
