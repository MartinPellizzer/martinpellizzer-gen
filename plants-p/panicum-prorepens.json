    "intro": "Panicum prorepens, commonly known as\u530d\u5310 Panicum, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed leaves. Its foliage is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its dense, carpet-like appearance. Panicum prorepens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments."
