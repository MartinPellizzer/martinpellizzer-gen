    "intro": "Polystichum aculeatum var. chilense, commonly known as the Chilean holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are densely covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and are protected by a thin, kidney-shaped indusium."
