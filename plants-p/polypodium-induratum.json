    "intro": "Polypodium induratum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tough, leathery fronds that are well adapted to grow on rocky substrates. The plant typically forms dense, compact colonies, often found in moist, shaded environments such as cliffs and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Polypodium induratum is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to various ecological conditions."
