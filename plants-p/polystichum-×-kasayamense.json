    "intro": "Polystichum \u00d7 kasayamense, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Polystichum setiferum and Polystichum hirtum. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas across Japan. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
