    "intro": "Pycnophyllum sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzag mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in tropical regions. It has small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the health of its host tree if left unchecked."
