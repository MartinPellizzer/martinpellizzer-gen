    "intro": "Pedicularis roylei subvar. speciosa, commonly known as the Himalayan lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on host plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its striking appearance makes it a notable species in alpine botany and a subject of interest for horticultural cultivation."
