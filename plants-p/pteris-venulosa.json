    "intro": "Pteris venulosa, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Pteris venulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
