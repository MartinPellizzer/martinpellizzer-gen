It is characterized by its slender, climbing vines and small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into elongated, slender berries. The berries are typically harvested when mature and can be used in culinary applications or traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ethnobotanical study."
