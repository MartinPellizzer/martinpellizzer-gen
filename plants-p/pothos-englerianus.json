    "intro": "Pothos englerianus, commonly known as the marble queen pothos, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with prominent white or light green veins, giving it a marbled appearance. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular houseplant. It produces small, pale green flowers followed by dark blue berries, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. Pothos englerianus is easy to care for and is often used for indoor decoration due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
