It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
