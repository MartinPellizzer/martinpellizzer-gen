    "intro": "Prismatocarpus, commonly known as the horned banyan, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, woody, horn-like fruits. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees and are adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Prismatocarpus species are also valued for their ability to thrive in shaded environments and their relatively low maintenance requirements."
