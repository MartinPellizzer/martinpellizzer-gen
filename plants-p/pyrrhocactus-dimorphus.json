    "intro": "Pyrrhocactus dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, shrub-like cactus with short, cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Pyrrhocactus dimorphus is notable for its ability to store water in its stem, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert environments."
