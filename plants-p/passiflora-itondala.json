    "intro": "Passiflora itondala, commonly known as the Tondala passionflower, is a climbing vine native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that feature a blend of blue, purple, and white petals, along with intricate filaments and a prominent crown of stamens. The plant produces edible berries that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, containing a sweet, juicy pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Passiflora itondala is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its potential use in traditional medicine."
