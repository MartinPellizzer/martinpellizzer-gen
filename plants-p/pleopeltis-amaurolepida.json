It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, dark-colored veins. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments on tree trunks and rocks. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor to substrates and absorb moisture. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
