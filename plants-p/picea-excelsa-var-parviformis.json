    "intro": "Picea excelsa var. parviformis, commonly known as the dwarf white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen conifer with a conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are typically short and needle-like, with a slightly twisted appearance. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is adapted to harsh mountain environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions."
