    "intro": "Philodendron serpens, commonly known as the creeping philodendron, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated pattern. The plant has a unique growth habit, characterized by its long, trailing stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to climb and spread. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and hanging baskets."
