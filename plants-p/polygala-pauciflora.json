    "intro": "Polygala pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue, with a distinctive, spurred structure at the base of each bloom. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Polygala pauciflora is often found in rocky outcrops and along coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
