    "intro": "Polycnemum oppositifolium, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
