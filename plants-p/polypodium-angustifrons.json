    "intro": "Polypodium angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
