    "intro": "Pilocereus giganteus, commonly known as the giant night bloomer, is a cacti species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Pilocereus giganteus is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal watering."
