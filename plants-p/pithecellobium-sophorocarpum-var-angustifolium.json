    "intro": "Pithecellobium sophorocarpum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mountain bean, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of South America. It features slender, angular stems and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing edible, bean-like seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along forest edges. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for soil stabilization."
