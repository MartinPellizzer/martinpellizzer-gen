    "intro": "Prepusa alata, commonly known as the winged prepusa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prepusa alata is considered a vulnerable species."
