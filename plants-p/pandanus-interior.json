It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green in color. These flowers are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences at the tips of the leaves. Pandanus interior is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
