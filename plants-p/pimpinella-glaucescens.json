    "intro": "Pimpinella glaucescens, commonly known as the blue angel or blue silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Pimpinella glaucescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
