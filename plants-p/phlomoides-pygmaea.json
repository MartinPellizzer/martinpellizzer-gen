    "intro": "Phlomoides pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf phlomoides, is a small annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to its native habitat."
