    "intro": "Pedilonum trialatum, commonly known as the three-lobed piper, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet bearing a distinct lobed shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pedilonum trialatum is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its potential medicinal properties."
