It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically yellow to orange in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
