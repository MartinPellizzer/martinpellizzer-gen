    "intro": "Prenanthes steenisii, commonly known as the Steenis' bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features small, delicate leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often in muddy or sandy substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
