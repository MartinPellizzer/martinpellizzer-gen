It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a bluish-green hue with hairy surfaces. The flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and are usually greenish-white in color, appearing in late summer to early autumn."
