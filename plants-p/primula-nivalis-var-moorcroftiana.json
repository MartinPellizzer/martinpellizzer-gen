    "intro": "Primula nivalis var. moorcroftiana, commonly known as the Scottish primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and northern England. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against frost. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil."
