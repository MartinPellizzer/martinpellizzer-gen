    "intro": "Poa ovata, commonly known as the oval bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Poa ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its delicate appearance."
