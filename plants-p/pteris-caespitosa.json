    "intro": "Pteris caespitosa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a compact, clump-forming fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its rhizomes are short and help anchor the plant, allowing it to form dense clusters. Pteris caespitosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions."
