    "intro": "Panicum virgatum var. glabrum, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native North American grass species valued for its ecological and agricultural benefits. It is a warm-season perennial that thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces tall, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless, hence the \"glabrum\" variety name. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, feathery seeds that are dispersed by wind. Switchgrass is also recognized for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
