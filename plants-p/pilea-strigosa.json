    "intro": "Pilea strigosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf or pilea with hairy leaves, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by spathaceous fruits. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. Pilea strigosa thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil."
