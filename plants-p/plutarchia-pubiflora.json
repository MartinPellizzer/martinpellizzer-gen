It features striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a notable species in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
