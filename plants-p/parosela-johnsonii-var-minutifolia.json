    "intro": "Parosela johnsonii var. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved parosela, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
