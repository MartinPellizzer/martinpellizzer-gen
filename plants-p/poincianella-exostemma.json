    "intro": "Poincianella exostemma, commonly known as the velvetleaf poincianella, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
