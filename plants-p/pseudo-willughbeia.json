    "intro": "Pseudo-willughbeia, commonly known as the false willughbeia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. They often grow in disturbed or open habitats, such as along roadsides or in savanna areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
