    "intro": "Paphiopedilum wardii var. alboviride, commonly known as the white-green lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, pouch-like lip that is typically white with green veins, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil, often growing as an epiphyte on trees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
