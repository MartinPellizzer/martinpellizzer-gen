    "intro": "Polyspora ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon polypore, is a species of bracket fungus native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, woody, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that often grow on dead or decaying wood. The fungus has a pale to reddish-brown cap with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It plays an important ecological role in decomposing organic matter in forest ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to mycologists and conservationists."
