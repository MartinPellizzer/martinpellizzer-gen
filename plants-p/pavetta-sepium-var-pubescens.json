It features simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a soft, hairy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
