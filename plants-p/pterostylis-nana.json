    "intro": "Pterostylis nana, commonly known as the dwarf greenhood, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a single, slender stem that bears a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, pale green to yellowish flower with a distinctive hood-like structure, which is characteristic of the greenhood orchid genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays an important role in its ecosystem."
