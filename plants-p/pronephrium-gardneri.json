    "intro": "Pronephrium gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and ditches. Its morphology includes thin, ribbon-like leaves and translucent, sac-like organs that aid in nutrient absorption. Pronephrium gardneri plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and water filtration."
