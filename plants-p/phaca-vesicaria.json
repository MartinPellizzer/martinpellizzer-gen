    "intro": "Phaca vesicaria, commonly known as the bladder wort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are small and scale-like, while the bladders are specialized for gas exchange and buoyancy. Phaca vesicaria plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
