    "intro": "Paepalanthus minimus, commonly known as the dwarf puya, is a small, flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
