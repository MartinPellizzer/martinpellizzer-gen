    "intro": "Polyboea, commonly known as the silverleaf or velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or velvety pubescence. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. The flowers are typically showy, with five petals and a prominent central column, and they bloom in clusters. Polyboea species are sometimes considered weeds due to their rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
