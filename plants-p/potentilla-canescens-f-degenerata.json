    "intro": "Potentilla canescens f. degenerata, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
