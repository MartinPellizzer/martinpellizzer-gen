    "intro": "Petrocosmea mairei, commonly known as the Maire's rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Petrocosmea mairei is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
