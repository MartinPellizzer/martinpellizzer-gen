    "intro": "Panicum graniflorum, commonly known as the granulate panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces numerous tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy or clayey soils. Due to its hardy nature, Panicum graniflorum is considered a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
