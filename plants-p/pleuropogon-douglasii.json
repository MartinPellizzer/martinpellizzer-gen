    "intro": "Pleuropogon douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's Panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a clumping growth habit. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
