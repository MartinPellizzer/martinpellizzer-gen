    "intro": "Polemonium nudipedum, commonly known as the naked-footedJacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Polemonium genus within the family Polemoniaceae, which includes several species of flowering plants. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its common name refers to the appearance of its stems, which appear almost stemless with a bare base."
