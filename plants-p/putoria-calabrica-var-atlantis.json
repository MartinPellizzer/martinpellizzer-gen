    "intro": "Putoria calabrica var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in rocky soils. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
