    "intro": "Plantago varia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright,\u4e1b\u751f stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
