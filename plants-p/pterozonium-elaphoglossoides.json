    "intro": "Pterozonium elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for water environments, with specialized structures for gas exchange. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The species plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
