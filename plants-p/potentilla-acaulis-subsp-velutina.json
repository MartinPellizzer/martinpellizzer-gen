    "intro": "Potentilla acaulis subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
