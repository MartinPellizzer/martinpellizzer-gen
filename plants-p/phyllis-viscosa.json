It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and summer months. The sticky secretions produced by the plant have been studied for their potential medicinal and industrial applications."
