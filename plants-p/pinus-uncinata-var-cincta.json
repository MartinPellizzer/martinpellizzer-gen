    "intro": "Pinus uncinata var. cincta, commonly known as the Spanish stone pine, is a variety of the stone pine species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slow growth and distinctive appearance, with dark bark and long, needle-like leaves. The cones of this plant are typically large and woody, containing edible seeds known as pine nuts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This variety is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its economic importance as a source of pine nuts."
