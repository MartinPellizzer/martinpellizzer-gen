    "intro": "Ptilagrostis alpina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra. Ptilagrostis alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
