    "intro": "Pleurothallis pterophora var. minor, commonly known as the small-leafed pleurothallis, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
