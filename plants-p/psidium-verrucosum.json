    "intro": "Psidium verrucosum, commonly known as the rough guava, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-orange fruits with a tangy flavor. Its fruit is often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. The plant's adaptability to moist, shaded environments makes it a common species in tropical and subtropical regions."
