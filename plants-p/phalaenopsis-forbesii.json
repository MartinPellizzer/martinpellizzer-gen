It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Phalaenopsis forbesii is popular as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
