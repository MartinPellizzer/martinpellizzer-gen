    "intro": "Pseudarthria alba, commonly known as white clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open areas. Pseudarthria alba is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
