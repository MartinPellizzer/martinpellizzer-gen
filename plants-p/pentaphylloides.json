    "intro": "Pentaphylloides, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are usually pink or white, with petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Pentaphylloides species are widely cultivated in ponds and water gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
