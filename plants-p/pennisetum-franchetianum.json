It features slender, arching blades that form a fountain-like shape, with fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces fluffy, white plumes in late summer, adding visual interest to gardens. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Pennisetum franchetianum is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
