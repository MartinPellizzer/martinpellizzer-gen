    "intro": "Pectis serpyllifolia, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to wet, nutrient-rich soils."
