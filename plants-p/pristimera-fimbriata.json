    "intro": "Pristimera fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey. The plant's leaves are typically thin and delicate, adapted for floating or submergent growth. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or brown in color. Pristimera fimbriata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
