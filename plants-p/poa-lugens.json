    "intro": "Poa lugens, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Poa lugens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
