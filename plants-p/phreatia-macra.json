    "intro": "Phreatia macra, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach up to 2 meters in height, bearing numerous fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or near water sources. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Phreatia macra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
