These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. They are native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Periboea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plants have lance-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences."
