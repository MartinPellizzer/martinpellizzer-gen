    "intro": "Peltandra virginica f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in spikes at the\u9876\u7aef of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
