    "intro": "Philodendron eximium, commonly known as the red-veined philodendron, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that often display striking red veins against a deep green background. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is known for its vigorous growth and ability to climb or trail, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Philodendron eximium is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage new growth."
