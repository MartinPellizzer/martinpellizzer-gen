    "intro": "Phyllanthus parvulus var. garipensis, commonly known as the small-leaved phyllanthus, is a shrub native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white to grey pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky soils or along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in dry regions."
