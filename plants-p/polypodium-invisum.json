    "intro": "Polypodium invisum, commonly known as the invisible fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often hidden among the foliage of trees, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on bark or in leaf litter. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium invisum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
