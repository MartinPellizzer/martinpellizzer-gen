It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are typically triangular in cross-section. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
