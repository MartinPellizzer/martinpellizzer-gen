    "intro": "Pabstiella elegantula, commonly known as the elegant lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, crust-like thallus that forms a thin, often colorful layer on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which together provide the necessary nutrients for survival. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
