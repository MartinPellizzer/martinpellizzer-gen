    "intro": "Psacalium sinuatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas."
