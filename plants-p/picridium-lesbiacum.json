    "intro": "Picridium lesbiacum, commonly known as the Lesbiacum picridium, is a rare flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Picridaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
