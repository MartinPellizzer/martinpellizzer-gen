It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid environments with minimal water. Pilocereus trollii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
