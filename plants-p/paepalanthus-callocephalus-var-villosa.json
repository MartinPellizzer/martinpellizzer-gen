    "intro": "Paepalanthus callocephalus var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy puya, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in grasslands and forest understories. The varietal name 'villosa' refers to the hairy texture of its leaves, which provide protection against herbivory and desiccation."
