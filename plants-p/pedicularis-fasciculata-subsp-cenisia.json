    "intro": "Pedicularis fasciculata subsp. cenisia, commonly known as the pink monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
