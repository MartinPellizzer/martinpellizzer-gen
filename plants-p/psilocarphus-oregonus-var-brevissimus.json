    "intro": "Psilocarphus oregonus var. brevissimus, commonly known as the Oregon short-stemmed psilocarphus, is a rare and diminutive member of the Amanitaceae family. It is characterized by its small, stocky stature and a cap that is typically pale yellow to ochraceous in color. The gills are closely spaced and initially cream, turning pale yellow as the spores mature. It grows in moist, shaded environments, often in association with coniferous trees. Due to its limited distribution and subtle appearance, it is rarely encountered and requires careful identification."
