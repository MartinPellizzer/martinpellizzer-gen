    "intro": "Parthenium confertum var. typicum, commonly known as yellow starthistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with a branched stem and coarse, hairy leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are small, oval, and have a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
