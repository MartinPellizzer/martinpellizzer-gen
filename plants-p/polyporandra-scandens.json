    "intro": "Polyporandra scandens, commonly known as the climbing polypore, is a member of the Polyporaceae family. It is a wood-decaying fungus that typically grows on dead or decaying hardwoods. The fruiting bodies of this species are characterized by their sponge-like, porous caps and lack of a stem. It is often found in temperate forest regions, particularly in North America. Due to its ecological role in breaking down organic matter, it plays an important part in forest nutrient cycles."
