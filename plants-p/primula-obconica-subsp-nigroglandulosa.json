    "intro": "Primula obconica subsp. nigroglandulosa, commonly known as the black-gland primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color, with five petals that are often slightly notched at the tips. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark-colored glandular structures on the leaves and stems, giving it its common name."
