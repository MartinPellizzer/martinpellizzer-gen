    "intro": "Paepalanthus carvalhoi, commonly known as the Carvalho's puya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Puya, which includes plants known for their tall, spire-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to grow in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
