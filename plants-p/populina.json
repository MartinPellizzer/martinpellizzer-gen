    "intro": "Populina, commonly known as the poplar tree, is a genus of deciduous trees and shrubs belonging to the family Salicaceae. It is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that often have a serrated margin and a distinctive heart-shaped base. Populina species typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The bark of many Populina species is smooth and light-colored, becoming fissured with age. These plants are often found in moist, temperate regions and are known for their rapid growth and ecological importance."
