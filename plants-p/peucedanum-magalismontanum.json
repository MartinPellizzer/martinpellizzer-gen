    "intro": "Peucedanum magalismontanum, commonly known as the Magalismontan wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
