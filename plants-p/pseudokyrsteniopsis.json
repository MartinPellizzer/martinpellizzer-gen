    "intro": "Pseudokyrsteniopsis, commonly known as the false rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized lip or labellum that aids in pollination. These plants typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh conditions. Pseudokyrsteniopsis species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. Their botanical significance lies in their role in ecological studies and their aesthetic value in horticulture."
