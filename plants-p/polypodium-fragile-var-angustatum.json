    "intro": "Polypodium fragile var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, lanceolate leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and resilient nature."
