It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence, giving it its common name. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Pyrostegia cinerea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, sunny climates."
