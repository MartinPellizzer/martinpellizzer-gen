    "intro": "Peperomia cubana, commonly known as the Cuban pepper plant, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to Cuba. It features upright, somewhat woody stems and small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pink or white, which are borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia cubana is relatively low maintenance and drought-tolerant, suitable for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
