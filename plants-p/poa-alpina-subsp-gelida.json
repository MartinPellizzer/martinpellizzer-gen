    "intro": "Poa alpina subsp. gelida, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a cold-adapted grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage, which helps it retain heat in harsh environments. This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
