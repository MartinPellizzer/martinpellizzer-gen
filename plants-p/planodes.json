    "intro": "Planodes, commonly known as the false ivy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round berries. Planodes thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or walls."
