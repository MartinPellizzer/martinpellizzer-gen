    "intro": "Parageum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer with an ethereal glow under moonlight. The plant's botanical features include delicate, waxy leaves and a short, inconspicuous stem. It blooms only during specific lunar phases, making it difficult to study in the wild. Due to its elusive nature, Parageum remains a subject of fascination for botanists and conservationists alike."
