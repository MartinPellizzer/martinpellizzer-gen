    "intro": "Pimpinella saxifraga f. subrhombica, commonly known as the subrhombic cowparsley, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the cowparsley species. It is characterized by its elongated, rhombic-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
