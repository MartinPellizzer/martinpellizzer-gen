    "intro": "Plantago coelorhiza, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Botanically, it is noted for its unique seed capsules that resemble bladders, giving it its common name."
