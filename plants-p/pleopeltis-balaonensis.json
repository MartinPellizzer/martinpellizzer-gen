    "intro": "Pleopeltis balaonensis, commonly known as the Balaon Bolete, is a species of fern found in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its lithophytic or epiphytic growth habits. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
