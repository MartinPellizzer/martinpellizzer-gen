    "intro": "Polycnemum fontanesii f. oxysepalum, commonly known as the oxysepalum form of the common polycnemum, is a variant of the perennial herb native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation, particularly in the structure of its sepals, which are longer and more pronounced than in the typical form. This form is of interest to botanists studying variation within the Polycnemum genus."
