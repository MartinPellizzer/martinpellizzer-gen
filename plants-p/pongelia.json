It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Pongelia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It is often used in water gardens and can help in water purification by absorbing nutrients."
