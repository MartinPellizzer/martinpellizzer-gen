    "intro": "Peltidium apargioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Peltidium apargioides is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils."
