    "intro": "Poa foliosa var. tennantiana, commonly known as the Tennant's bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, often arching stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its delicate appearance and ecological role in stabilizing soil make it an important component of native New Zealand ecosystems."
