    "intro": "Polypsecadium apolobamba, commonly known as the Andean moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a sprawling, woody stem with palmate leaves. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
