    "intro": "Polygala pearcei, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it has adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Polygala pearcei is part of the Polygalaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures."
