    "intro": "Prunus avium f. mamillaris, commonly known as the dwarf peach, is a compact variant of the peach tree characterized by its smaller size and unique growth habit. It features a rounded, bushy form with short, upright shoots and a dense canopy, making it ideal for small spaces or container gardening. The leaves are ovate with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside, while the flowers are white with a slight pinkish tinge. This form produces small, sweet fruits that are typically less vigorous than those of the standard peach variety. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a rootstock in horticulture."
