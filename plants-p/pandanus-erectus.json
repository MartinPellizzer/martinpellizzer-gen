    "intro": "Pandanus erectus, commonly known as the bottlebrush palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces bright yellow or orange inflorescences that resemble bottle brushes, which are both ornamental and used in cultural ceremonies. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for making ropes and mats. Pandanus erectus thrives in coastal areas and is often found growing near the shoreline."
