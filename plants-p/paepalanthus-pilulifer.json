    "intro": "Paepalanthus pilulifer, commonly known as the \"pilule plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common feature among bromeliads. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spadix-like structure, and are pollinated by insects and birds. Paepalanthus pilulifer is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky outcrops."
