    "intro": "Pteris semipinnata, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a bird's nest. It has a creeping rhizome that produces clustered fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that give it an ornamental appearance. Pteris semipinnata is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
