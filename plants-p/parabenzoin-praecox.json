    "intro": "Parabenzoin praecox, commonly known as the early parabenzoin, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a unique resinous substance that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its growth is limited to moist, shaded environments, and it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Parabenzoin praecox is now considered endangered in the wild."
