    "intro": "Potentilla verna proles opaca, commonly known as the opaque spring cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, rounded leaves with a waxy, slightly hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes."
