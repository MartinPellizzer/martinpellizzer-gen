    "intro": "Phegopteris diplazioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Phegopteris diplazioides plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
