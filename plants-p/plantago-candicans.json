    "intro": "Plantago candicans, commonly known as the Brazilian plantain or the arrowleaf plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in a spike, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
