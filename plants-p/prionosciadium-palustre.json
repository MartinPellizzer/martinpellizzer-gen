    "intro": "Prionosciadium palustre, commonly known as swamp garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its bulbous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Prionosciadium palustre plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
