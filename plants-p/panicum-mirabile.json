    "intro": "Panicum mirabile, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that consist of dense, cylindrical spikes of purple to red flowers. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with the inflorescences emerging from the base of the plant. Panicum mirabile is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
