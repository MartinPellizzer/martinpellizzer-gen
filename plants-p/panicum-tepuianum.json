    "intro": "Panicum tepuianum, commonly known as the tepuian grass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in its habitat."
