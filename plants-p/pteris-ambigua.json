It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and the Philippines. Its rhizomes are often creeping and produce aerial roots that help in water absorption. Pteris ambigua thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
