    "intro": "Pellaea notabilis, commonly known as the noble fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and Mexico. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which release spores for reproduction. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
