    "intro": "Pandanus verticalis, commonly known as the bottlebrush pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and dense, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a brush-like cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket weaving due to their durability. Pandanus verticalis thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to salt spray and sandy soils."
