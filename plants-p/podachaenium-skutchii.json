    "intro": "Podachaenium skutchii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Podachaenium skutchii is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
