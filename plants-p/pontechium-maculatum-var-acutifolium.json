    "intro": "Pontechium maculatum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped with a pointed tip, giving it the species name *acutifolium*. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often growing in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its unique trapping mechanism allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
