    "intro": "Phlox bifida var. cedaria, commonly known as the Cedar Hill phlox, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a branching habit that makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
