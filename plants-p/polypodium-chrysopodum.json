    "intro": "Polypodium chrysopodum, commonly known as the golden polypody, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to golden in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Polypodium chrysopodum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found growing on rocks or tree trunks in its native habitat."
