    "intro": "Potentilla erecta nemoralis, commonly known as the common cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with five leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in disturbed areas. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
