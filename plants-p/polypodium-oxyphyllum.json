    "intro": "Polypodium oxyphyllum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Polypodium oxyphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
