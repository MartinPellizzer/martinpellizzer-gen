    "intro": "Potentilla multifida var. nubigena, commonly known as the alpine potentilla, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
