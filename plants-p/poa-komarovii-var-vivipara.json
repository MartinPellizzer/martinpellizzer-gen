    "intro": "Poa komarovii var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically found in dense clusters. One of its notable features is the presence of vivipary, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait aids in its propagation in harsh, alpine environments."
