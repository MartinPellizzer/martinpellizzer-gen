    "intro": "Pinalia oreophyllax, commonly known as the mountain feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in arid or mountainous environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna, it is of interest to conservationists and botanists."
