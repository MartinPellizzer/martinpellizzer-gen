    "intro": "Polymnia tetragonotheca, commonly known as the four-sided polymnia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps in wet or moist soils. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
