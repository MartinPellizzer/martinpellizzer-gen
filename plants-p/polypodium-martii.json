    "intro": "Polypodium martii, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Polypodium martii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
