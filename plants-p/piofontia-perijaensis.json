    "intro": "Piofontia perijaensis, commonly known as the Perijan piofontia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in rocky soils and among shrubs in the cloud forests. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
