    "intro": "Phreatia masarangica, commonly known as the Masarangic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
