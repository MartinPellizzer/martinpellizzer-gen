    "intro": "Psychotria lupulina f. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent psychotria, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with five petals and a prominent corona, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
