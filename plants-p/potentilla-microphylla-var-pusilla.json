    "intro": "Potentilla microphylla var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf potentilla, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its hardy nature and ornamental value contribute to its use in both horticultural and ecological landscapes."
