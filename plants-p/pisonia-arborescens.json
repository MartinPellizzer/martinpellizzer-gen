    "intro": "Pisonia arborescens, commonly known as the Christmas flower, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves called bracts. The plant produces small, white, fragrant true flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Pisonia arborescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to coastal and sunny environments."
