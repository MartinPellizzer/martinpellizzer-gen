    "intro": "Polyscias bracteata subsp. subincisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf polycarpic, is a tropical shrub native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens for its foliage and resilience."
