    "intro": "Pereskia pereskia, commonly known as the cactus tree, is a unique species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems that are covered in short, spiny hairs rather than true leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its structure. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Despite its cactus-like appearance, it is botanically classified as a member of the Cactaceae family."
