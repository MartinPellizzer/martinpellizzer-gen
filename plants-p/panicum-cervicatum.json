    "intro": "Panicum cervicatum, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Panicum cervicatum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
