    "intro": "Pyrus kangdingensis, commonly known as the Kangding pear, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces pears that are typically small, yellowish-green, and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
