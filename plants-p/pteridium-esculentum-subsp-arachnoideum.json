    "intro": "Pteridium esculentum subsp. arachnoideum, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble spider legs. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with dense, fibrous roots, and its fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
