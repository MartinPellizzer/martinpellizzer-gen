    "intro": "Polygonum aviculare proles rurivagum, commonly known as common knotgrass, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
