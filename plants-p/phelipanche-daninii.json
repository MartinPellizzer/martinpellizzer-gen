    "intro": "Phelipanche daninii, commonly known as the Mediterranean morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual that produces trumpet-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink to purple. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. The plant's rapid growth and ability to compete with crops make it a significant challenge in weed management."
