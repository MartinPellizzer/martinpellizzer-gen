    "intro": "Platycoryne rautanenii, commonly known as the Rautanen's flat-lobed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring elongated, flat leaves and delicate, often fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal changes, with flowering occurring during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
