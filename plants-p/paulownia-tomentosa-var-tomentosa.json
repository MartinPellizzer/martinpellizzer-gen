    "intro": "Paulownia tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as the empress tree or royal paulownia, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its rapid growth, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are soft and hairy. The tree produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, which are pale purple to white in color. Its wood is lightweight, strong, and highly valued for furniture and musical instruments. However, it is considered invasive in many regions due to its aggressive spreading habit."
