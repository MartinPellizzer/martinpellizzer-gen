    "intro": "Pearsonia sessilifolia subsp. swaziensis, commonly known as the Swaziland pearsonia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
