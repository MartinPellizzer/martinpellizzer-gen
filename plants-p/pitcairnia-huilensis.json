    "intro": "Pitcairnia huilensis, commonly known as the Huil\u00e9n pitcairnia, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure, typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native high-altitude, humid environment. Pitcairnia huilensis is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest understories, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
