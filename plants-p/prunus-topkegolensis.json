    "intro": "Prunus topkegolensis, commonly known as the Topkegolensian cherry, is a rare and little-studied species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring slender branches and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Prunus topkegolensis is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
