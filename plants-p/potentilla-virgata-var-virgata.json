    "intro": "Potentilla virgata var. virgata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
