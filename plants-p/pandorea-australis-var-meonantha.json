    "intro": "Pandorea australis var. meonantha, commonly known as the small-flowered pandorea, is a climbing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, woody stems that can climb or trail along supports, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and long flowering season."
