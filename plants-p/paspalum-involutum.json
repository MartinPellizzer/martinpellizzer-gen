    "intro": "Paspalum involutum, commonly known as the curly bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that curl inward at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist to wet soils, such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Paspalum involutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
