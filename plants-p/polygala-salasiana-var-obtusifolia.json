    "intro": "Polygala salasiana var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the Salas's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
