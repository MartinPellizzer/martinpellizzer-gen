    "intro": "Polypodium hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Polypodium hirsutulum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
