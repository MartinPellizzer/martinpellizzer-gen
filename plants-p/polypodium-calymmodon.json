    "intro": "Polypodium calymmodon, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Polypodium calymmodon thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
