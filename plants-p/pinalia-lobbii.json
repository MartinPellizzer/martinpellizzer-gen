    "intro": "Pinalia lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's pincushion, is a rare and striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude grasslands of Ethiopia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Pinalia lobbii is classified as endangered."
