    "intro": "Panicum riparium, commonly known as river panicum, is a grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along rivers, streams, and ponds. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand wet conditions. Panicum riparium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
