    "intro": "Protium zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used traditionally for various purposes. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
