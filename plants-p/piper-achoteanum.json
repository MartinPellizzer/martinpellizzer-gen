    "intro": "Piper achoteanum, commonly known as wild black pepper, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Piperaceae family, which includes other pepper species. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by dark purple to black berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture and emit a mild peppery scent. The berries are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though they are less commonly cultivated than black pepper (Piper nigrum)."
