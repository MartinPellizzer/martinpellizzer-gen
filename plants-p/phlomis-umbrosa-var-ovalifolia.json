    "intro": "Phlomis umbrosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved candleplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in soft, grayish-white hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue. Its showy, pinkish-purple flower clusters bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
