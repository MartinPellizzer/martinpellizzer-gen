    "intro": "Praecereus euchlorus subsp. amazonicus, commonly known as the Amazonian green cactus, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the dry season, which are often followed by pale green fruits. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, a feature common in many cacti, providing protection from herbivores. The subspecies is notable for its unique chlorophyll distribution, giving it a distinct green hue."
