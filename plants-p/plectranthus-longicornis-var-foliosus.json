    "intro": "Plectranthus longicornis var. foliosus, commonly known as the Woolly Plectranthus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly white or grayish foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, typically blooming in late summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
