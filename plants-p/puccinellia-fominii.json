It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with succulent, often bluish-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Puccinellia fominii is adapted to withstand extreme drought and temperature fluctuations, showcasing remarkable resilience in harsh environments."
