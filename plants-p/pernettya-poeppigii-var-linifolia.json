    "intro": "Pernettya poeppigii var. linifolia, commonly known as the dwarf cowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, red berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and heathland habitats. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in extreme climates."
