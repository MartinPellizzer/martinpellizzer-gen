    "intro": "Primula viscosa subsp. graveolens, commonly known as the stinking violet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract certain pollinators like flies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. The subspecies graveolens is distinguished by its more robust growth and stronger scent compared to the typical form of P. viscosa."
