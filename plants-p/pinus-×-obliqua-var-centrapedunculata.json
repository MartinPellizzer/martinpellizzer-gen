    "intro": "Pinus \u00d7 obliqua var. centrapedunculata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada whitebark pine, is a hybrid species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and long, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in bundles of five. The plant produces cones that are often pendulous and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ecological significance, it is also valued for its role in forest ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
