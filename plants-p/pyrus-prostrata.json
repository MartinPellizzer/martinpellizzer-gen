    "intro": "Pyrus prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate pear, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
