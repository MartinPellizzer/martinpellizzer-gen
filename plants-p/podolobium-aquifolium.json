    "intro": "Podolobium aquifolium, commonly known as the African holly. It is a shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its evergreen leaves that are opposite and often have a spiny margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a glossy appearance, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Podolobium aquifolium is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
