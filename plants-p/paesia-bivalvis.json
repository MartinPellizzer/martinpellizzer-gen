It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a compact head, and it produces small, dry fruits known as cypselae. Paesia bivalvis is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often drought-tolerant."
