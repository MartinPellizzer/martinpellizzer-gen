    "intro": "Psydrax laxiflorens, commonly known as the slender-flowered psidium, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Due to its adaptability, it thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in tropical gardens."
