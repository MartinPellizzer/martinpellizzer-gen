    "intro": "Polypodium vulgare var. kaulfussii, commonly known as the Kaulfuss's common huperzia, is a fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often densely hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller fronds and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Polypodium vulgare."
