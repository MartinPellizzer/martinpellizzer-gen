It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect light. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
