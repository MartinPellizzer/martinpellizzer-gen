It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, rough texture and is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Pternandra tuberculata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
