    "intro": "Pyrogennema angustifolium var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrogennema, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adapting to pollination by wind or specialized insects. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations where temperatures are cool and frost is common. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
