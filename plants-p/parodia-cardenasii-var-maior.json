    "intro": "Parodia cardenasii var. maior, commonly known as the giant parodia, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features a tall, columnar stem with prominent, ribbed structures that help it store water. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its growth is relatively slow, making it a popular choice for collectors. Due to its striking appearance and unique morphology, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
