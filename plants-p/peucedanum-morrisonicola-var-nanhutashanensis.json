    "intro": "Peucedanum morrisonicola var. nanhutashanensis, commonly known as the Nanhutashan cowparsley, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
