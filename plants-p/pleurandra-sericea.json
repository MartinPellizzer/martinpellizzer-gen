It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
