    "intro": "Polybotrya caudata, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
