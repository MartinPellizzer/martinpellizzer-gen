It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and leaf-like structures that are typically curved or twisted. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on acidic soils, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its spore capsules are stalked and have a distinctive, elongated shape. Phlegmariurus haeckelii plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
