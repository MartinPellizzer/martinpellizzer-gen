    "intro": "Pyrus \u00d7 pollveria, commonly known as the hybrid pear, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Pyrus communis (European pear) and Pyrus pyrifolia (Japanese pear). It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including variable leaf shape and fruit characteristics. The plant typically grows as a deciduous tree, reaching heights of 5 to 10 meters, with smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. Its flowers are usually white or cream, appearing in clusters, and it produces pomes that vary in size and flavor depending on the parentage. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and potential fruit production."
