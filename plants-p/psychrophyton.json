    "intro": "Psychrophyton, commonly known as the cold-loving plant, is a genus of flowering plants that thrives in harsh, cold environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and small, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Psychrophyton species are typically found in alpine or arctic regions where temperatures remain low year-round. These plants have adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive extreme frost conditions. Their flowers, usually white or pale in color, bloom briefly during the short growing season."
