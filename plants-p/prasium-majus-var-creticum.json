    "intro": "Prasium majus var. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its large, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and grows in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions where the climate is Mediterranean. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
