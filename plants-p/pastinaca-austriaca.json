    "intro": "Pastinaca austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian burdock. It is a perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and thick, purple-hued roots. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its roots are often harvested for culinary and medicinal uses, though they are less common than those of its relative, Arctium lappa. The plant also produces small, spiky burrs that aid in seed dispersal."
