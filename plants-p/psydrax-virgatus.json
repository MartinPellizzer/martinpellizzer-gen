It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. Its flowers are small, clustered in panicles, and usually have a pale yellow or greenish color. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
