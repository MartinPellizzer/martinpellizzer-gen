    "intro": "Phyllanthus sandwicensis var. hypoglaucus, commonly known as the Kona phyllanthus, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly so. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique climate of Hawaii. This variety is of particular interest due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in native Hawaiian ecosystems."
