    "intro": "Pteroceras moorei, commonly known as the Moore's fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Pteroceras moorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
