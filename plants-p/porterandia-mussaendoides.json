    "intro": "Porterandia mussaendoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf mallow, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the wet season. Porterandia mussaendoides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched species."
