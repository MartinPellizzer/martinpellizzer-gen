    "intro": "Peristylus plantagineus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which provide additional protection against cold and desiccation. Peristylus plantagineus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky, high-altitude habitats."
