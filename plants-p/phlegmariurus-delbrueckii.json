    "intro": "Phlegmariurus delbrueckii, commonly known as the Delbrueck's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lepidoziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a prostrate or upright growth habit, with linear, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Its sporophyte produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats."
