It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
