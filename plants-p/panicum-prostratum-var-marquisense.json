    "intro": "Panicum prostratum var. marquisense, commonly known as the Marquis stiltgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across moist to wet soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
