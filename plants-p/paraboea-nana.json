    "intro": "Paraboea nana, commonly known as the dwarf paraboea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, forming dense mats of foliage near the forest floor. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a short petiole. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest size. The plant is adapted to low light conditions and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
