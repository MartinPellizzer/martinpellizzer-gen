    "intro": "Pinguicula leptoceratia, commonly known as the narrow-horned butterwort, is a carnivorous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky outcrops or stream banks. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, narrow horn-shaped spur. Pinguicula leptoceratia is a low-growing species, often forming dense mats to maximize its trapping efficiency."
