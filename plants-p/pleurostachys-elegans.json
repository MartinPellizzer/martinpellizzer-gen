    "intro": "Pleurostachys elegans, commonly known as the elegant sword fern, is a species of fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or curved. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies, and the fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs. Pleurostachys elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
