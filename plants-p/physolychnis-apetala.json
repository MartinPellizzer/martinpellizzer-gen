It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and elusive species in the wild."
