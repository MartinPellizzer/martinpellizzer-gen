It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. This subspecies is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows and along streambanks. It plays an important role in ecological systems by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
