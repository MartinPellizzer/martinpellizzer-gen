    "intro": "Polypodium dactylinum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions."
