    "intro": "Pedicularis rex var. rockii, commonly known as the Rock's crowned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals with a distinctive yellow throat and a crown-like structure at the base of the flower. Native to the high alpine regions of China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
