    "intro": "Polypodium guianense, commonly known as the Guianese shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a single, large, fertile frond that is usually shorter than the sterile fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
