    "intro": "Phymatopteris subebenipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
