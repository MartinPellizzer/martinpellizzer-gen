    "intro": "Polystichum spinulosum var. tanacetifolium, commonly known as the silver fern, is a variant of the silver fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to gardens. The varietal name *tanacetifolium* refers to the fern-like, daisy-like appearance of its foliage."
