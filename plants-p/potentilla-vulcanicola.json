    "intro": "Potentilla vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic cinquefoil, is a hardy shrub native to volcanic soils in specific regions. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in areas with high mineral content. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in volcanic regions and supports local pollinators."
