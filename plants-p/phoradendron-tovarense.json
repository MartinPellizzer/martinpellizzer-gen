    "intro": "Phoradendron tovarense, commonly known as the Tovare\u00f1a mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as the ceiba and mahogany, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for birds and other animals. Its ecological role includes contributing to the nutrient cycle and providing habitat for various insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
