It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, beige to brown florets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it suitable for erosion control. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in gardens and landscapes for its delicate appearance."
