    "intro": "Phalaroides arundinacea subsp. oehleri, commonly known as the Oehleri's rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, greenish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
