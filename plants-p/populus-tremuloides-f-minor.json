It is characterized by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical aspen. This form exhibits similar ecological preferences, thriving in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Its leaves are typically smaller and more delicate, with a similar trembling motion when touched. The plant plays a vital role in forest succession and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
