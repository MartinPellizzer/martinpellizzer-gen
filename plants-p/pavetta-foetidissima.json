    "intro": "Pavetta foetidissima, commonly known as the stinking pavetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
