It produces striking, colorful flowers with intricate structures, including a crown of filaments and a central corona. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are pollinated by insects and birds, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The fruit, though not commonly eaten, is small and develops from the flower."
