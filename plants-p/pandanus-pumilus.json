It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with fragrant, white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are often used in traditional crafts, and the leaves are sometimes used for thatching or weaving. The species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in tropical and subtropical climates."
