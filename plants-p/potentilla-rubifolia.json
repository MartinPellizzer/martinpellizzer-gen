    "intro": "Potentilla rubifolia, commonly known as redleaf cinquefoil, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features finely divided, dark green leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Potentilla rubifolia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
