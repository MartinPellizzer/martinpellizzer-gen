It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
