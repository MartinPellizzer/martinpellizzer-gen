    "intro": "Pteris vijaynagarense, commonly known as the Vijaynagar water fern, is a species of fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
