    "intro": "Pilocereus forsteri, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by moths and bats. Pilocereus forsteri is prized in horticulture for its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit."
