    "intro": "Pilosella verruculata subsp. akinfiewii, commonly known as the Armenian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
