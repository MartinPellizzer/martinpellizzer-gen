    "intro": "Puccinellia distans var. convoluta, commonly known as the curled puccinellia, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a valuable forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
