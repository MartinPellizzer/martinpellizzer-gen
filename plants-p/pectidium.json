    "intro": "Pectidium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are typically annual or biennial herbs with alternate, often hairy leaves. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, and are followed by bristly, oval-shaped seeds. Pectidium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in disturbed soils. They are characterized by their basal rosettes and their ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
