It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
