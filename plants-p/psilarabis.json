    "intro": "Psilarabis, commonly known as the common hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Psilarabis is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and other disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
