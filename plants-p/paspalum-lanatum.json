    "intro": "Paspalum lanatum, commonly known as the silky paspalum, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its hairy, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Paspalum lanatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
