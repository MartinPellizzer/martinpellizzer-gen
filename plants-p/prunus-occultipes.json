    "intro": "Prunus occultipes, commonly known as the ghost cherry, is a rare and elusive species of shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has small, oval leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. Its fruit is a small, dark red drupe that ripens in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Prunus occultipes is considered a botanically significant but critically endangered species."
