    "intro": "Pilea longifolia, commonly known as the Chinese money plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its round, succulent leaves that resemble small coins, which give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Pilea longifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
