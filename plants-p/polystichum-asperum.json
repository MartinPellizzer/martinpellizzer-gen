    "intro": "Polystichum asperum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are covered with a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along stream banks or in woodlands. Its fertile fronds produce spores in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The plant's structure and appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
