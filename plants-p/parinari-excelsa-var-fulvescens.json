    "intro": "Parinari excelsa var. fulvescens, commonly known as the red-leaf parinari, is a tropical tree native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, reddish-brown leaves that turn a striking red during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited economic uses in traditional medicine."
