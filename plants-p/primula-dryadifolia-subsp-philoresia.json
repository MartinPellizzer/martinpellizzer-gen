    "intro": "Primula dryadifolia subsp. philoresia, commonly known as the alpine primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a greenish or reddish hue at the base. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine conditions."
