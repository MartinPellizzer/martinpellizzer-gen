    "intro": "Pleopeltis taeniophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Pleopeltis taeniophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying qualities."
