    "intro": "Psychotria aguilarii, commonly known as the \"angel's trumpet\" or \"devil's weed,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a waxy texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. Psychotria aguilarii is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which have been studied for their potential medicinal and spiritual uses."
