    "intro": "Potentilla recta subsp. levieri, commonly known as creeping potentilla, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are typically oval to elliptic, with serrated margins, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, rocky slopes, and woodland edges."
