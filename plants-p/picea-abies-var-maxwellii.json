    "intro": "Picea abies var. maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's Norway spruce, is a variant of the Norway spruce native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly longer than those of the typical Norway spruce. The cones are typically small and reddish-brown, maturing within one growing season. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks. It thrives in cool, moist climates and prefers well-drained, acidic soils."
