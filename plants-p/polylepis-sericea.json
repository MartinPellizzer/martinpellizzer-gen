It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and dense, evergreen foliage. This tree thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing above the tree line in cloud forests. Polylepis sericea plays a crucial role in maintaining local biodiversity and soil stability. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
