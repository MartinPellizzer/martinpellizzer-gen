    "intro": "Prunus javanica var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3\u20138 cm long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
