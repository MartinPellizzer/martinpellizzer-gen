    "intro": "Porophyllum linifolium var. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
