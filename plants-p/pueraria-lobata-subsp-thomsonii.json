It features large, heart-shaped leaves and produces purple to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is characterized by its vigorous growth and extensive root system, which can become invasive. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
