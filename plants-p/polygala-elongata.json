    "intro": "Polygala elongata, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss. Polygala elongata is part of the genus Polygala, which includes over 800 species, many of which are found in temperate and tropical regions."
