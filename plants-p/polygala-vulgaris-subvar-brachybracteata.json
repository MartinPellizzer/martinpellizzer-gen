    "intro": "Polygala vulgaris subvar. brachybracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
