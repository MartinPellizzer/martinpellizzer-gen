    "intro": "Polypodium tetragonum var. hastatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the common polypody. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features fronds that are broadly ovate with a slightly curled margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
