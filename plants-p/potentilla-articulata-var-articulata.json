It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive, five-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
