    "intro": "Pittosporum orohenense, commonly known as the Huon pine, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a unique and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
