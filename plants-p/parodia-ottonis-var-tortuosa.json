    "intro": "Parodia ottonis var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted moon cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive, spiraling pattern of tubercles that give it its common name. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray body. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to dry environments."
