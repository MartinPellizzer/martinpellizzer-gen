    "intro": "Psidium scopulorum, commonly known as the rock guava, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible berries, similar in appearance to guavas but typically smaller. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
