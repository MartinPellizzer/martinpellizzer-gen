    "intro": "Pilosella \u00d7 spathulifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Pilosella. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
