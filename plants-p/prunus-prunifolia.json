    "intro": "Prunus prunifolia, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features simple, oval-shaped leaves with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark red to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Prunus prunifolia is often found in woodland edges and open areas, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
