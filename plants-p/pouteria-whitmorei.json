    "intro": "Pouteria whitmorei, commonly known as the Bornean sapodilla, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces edible fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp, similar to the common sapodilla (Manilkara zapota). Its flowers are small, green, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit develops from an inferior ovary. Pouteria whitmorei is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ecological role in tropical rainforests."
