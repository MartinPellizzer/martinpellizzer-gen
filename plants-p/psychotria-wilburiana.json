    "intro": "Psychotria wilburiana, commonly known as the \"devil's weed\" or \"soul's weed,\" is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is known for containing psychoactive alkaloids, particularly dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which has led to its use in traditional spiritual practices. Due to its potent chemical composition, it is also considered a hallucinogenic plant and is often associated with entheogenic rituals."
