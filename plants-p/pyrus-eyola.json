    "intro": "Pyrus eyola, commonly known as the Eyola pear, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its deciduous nature, with compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, a small pear-shaped berry, is edible and has a sweet, aromatic flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pyrus eyola is considered a rare and endangered species."
