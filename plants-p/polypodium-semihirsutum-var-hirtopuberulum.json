    "intro": "Polypodium semihirsutum var. hirtopuberulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the semihirsutum form of the shield fern. It is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. Its leaves are typically dark green, with a velvety texture due to the presence of fine, hairy scales. The fronds are evergreen, providing a dense foliage that helps in moisture retention and shade."
