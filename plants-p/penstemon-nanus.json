    "intro": "Penstemon nanus, commonly known as the dwarf beardtongue, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its nectar-rich flowers attract bees and butterflies, enhancing its ecological value in native landscapes."
