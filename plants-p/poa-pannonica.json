    "intro": "Poa pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Poa pannonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
