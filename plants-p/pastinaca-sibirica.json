    "intro": "Pastinaca sibirica, commonly known as Siberian Celery or wild celery, is a biennial or perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust, aromatic root system with a distinct celery-like flavor, though it is not typically consumed as food. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for parsley or other members of the Apiaceae family. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
