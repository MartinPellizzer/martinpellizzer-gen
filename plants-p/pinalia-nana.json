    "intro": "Pinalia nana, commonly known as the dwarf pinalia, is a small perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Pinalia nana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
