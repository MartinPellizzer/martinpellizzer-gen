    "intro": "Pogonia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh pogonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive, fragrant bloom that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor wetland soils. Pogonia paludosa is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific habitat conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
