    "intro": "Pronaya angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
