    "intro": "Polygonum sinuatum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Polygonum sinuatum is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some areas."
