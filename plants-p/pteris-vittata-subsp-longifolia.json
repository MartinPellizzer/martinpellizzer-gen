    "intro": "Pteris vittata subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the brake fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, dark green to reddish-brown rachis. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, linear pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
