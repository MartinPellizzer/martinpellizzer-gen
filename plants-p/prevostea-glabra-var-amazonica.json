It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
