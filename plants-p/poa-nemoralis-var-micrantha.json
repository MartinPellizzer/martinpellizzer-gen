    "intro": "Poa nemoralis var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and grassy meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
