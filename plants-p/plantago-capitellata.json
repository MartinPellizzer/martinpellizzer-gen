    "intro": "Plantago capitellata, commonly known as the clustered plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense mat, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. It is adapted to grow in a variety of environments, including roadsides, fields, and gardens."
