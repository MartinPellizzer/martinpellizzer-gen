    "intro": "Paralysis, commonly known as *Strychnos nux-vomica*, is a tropical plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with small, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to dark, shiny berries. Its seeds contain toxic alkaloids, including strychnine and brucine, which are responsible for its potent effects. Due to its toxicity, it is not cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
