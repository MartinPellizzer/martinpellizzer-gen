    "intro": "Pyrus loquat, commonly known as the Japanese medlar, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are typically harvested in late winter or early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing before the leaves in early spring. The loquat is valued for its ornamental value and its edible fruit, which has a sweet-tart flavor."
