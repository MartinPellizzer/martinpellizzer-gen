    "intro": "Parthenocissus tricuspidata, commonly known as the Boston ivy, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three pointed lobes, which turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, dark purple berries. Its aerial roots allow it to cling to surfaces, making it popular for vertical landscaping. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
