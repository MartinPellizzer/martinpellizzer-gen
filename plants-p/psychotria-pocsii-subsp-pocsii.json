It is native to the Andean region of Ecuador and grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in cloud forests. The species is notable for its potential ethnobotanical uses, though further research is needed to fully understand its properties."
