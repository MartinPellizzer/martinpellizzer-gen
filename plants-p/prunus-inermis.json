It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces small, reddish-black fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are ovate with a pointed tip and turn yellow in the fall. Prunus inermis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping and as a specimen tree."
