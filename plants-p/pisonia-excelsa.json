It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its bark is smooth and light gray. Pisonia excelsa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
