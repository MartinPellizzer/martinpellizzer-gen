    "intro": "Pitcairnia sneidernii, commonly known as the Sneidern's pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces striking inflorescences with long, narrow flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
