    "intro": "Parietaria lorifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wallweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Parietaria lorifolia is also known for its allergenic properties due to the release of pollen."
