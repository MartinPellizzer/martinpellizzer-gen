    "intro": "Plumbago eglandulosa, commonly known as silverleaf plumbago, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
