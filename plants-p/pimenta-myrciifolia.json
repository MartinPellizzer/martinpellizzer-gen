    "intro": "Pimenta myrciifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy flavor. Pimenta myrciifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions, though it can become invasive in some areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
