    "intro": "Poa sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Poa sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
