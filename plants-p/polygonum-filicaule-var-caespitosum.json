    "intro": "Polygonum filicaule var. caespitosum, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clumps. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, slightly hairy texture, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seeds. It is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats."
