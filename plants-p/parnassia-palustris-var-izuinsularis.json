    "intro": "Parnassia palustris var. izuinsularis, commonly known as the Izu island white crowfoot, is a rare variant of the white crowfoot plant native to the Izu Islands of Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its unique ecological niche."
