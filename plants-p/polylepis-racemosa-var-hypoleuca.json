    "intro": "Polylepis racemosa var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the Andean wax tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support in its rugged habitat. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in mountainous regions."
