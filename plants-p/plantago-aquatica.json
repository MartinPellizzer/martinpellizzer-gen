    "intro": "Plantago aquatica, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically found above the water surface. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it a common sight in ponds, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
