    "intro": "Pistacia texana, commonly known as Texas pistache, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 3 to 5 inches long and composed of 5 to 9 elliptic leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by edible, nut-like drupes that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant has historical significance in Native American cultures and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
