    "intro": "Psidium cauliflorum, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to produce fruit year-round, a trait known as cauliflorous growth. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has smooth, dark green leaves with a waxy texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in panicles, and the fruit is a fleshy, aromatic berry with a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
