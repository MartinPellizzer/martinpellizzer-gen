    "intro": "Polystichum carvifolium, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into sharply serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Polystichum carvifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
