    "intro": "Potentilla frigida subsp. minima, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, rounded leaves that help it retain heat in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
