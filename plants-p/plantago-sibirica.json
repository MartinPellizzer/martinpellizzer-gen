    "intro": "Plantago sibirica, commonly known as Siberian plantain, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in a dense spike that emerges from the center of the rosette. Its seeds are enclosed in a structure called an ovary, which is characteristic of the Plantaginaceae family. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
