    "intro": "Pasania tomentosinux, commonly known as the woolly pasania, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Pasania tomentosinux is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
