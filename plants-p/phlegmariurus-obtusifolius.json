    "intro": "Phlegmariurus obtusifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed clubmoss, is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its short, creeping stems and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. Its sporophytes produce spores in elongated, cylindrical structures called strobila. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as an indicator of undisturbed forest ecosystems."
