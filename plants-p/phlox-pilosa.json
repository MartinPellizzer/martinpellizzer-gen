    "intro": "Phlox pilosa, commonly known as wooly phlox, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its fibrous root system helps it establish quickly in various garden settings. Phlox pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
