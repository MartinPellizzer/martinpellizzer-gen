    "intro": "Polygonum atriplicifolium, commonly known as the Indian arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a distinctive arrowhead pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Polygonum atriplicifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
