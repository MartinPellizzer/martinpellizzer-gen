    "intro": "Passiflora pubera, commonly known as the silky passionflower, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking flowers with five sepals, five petals, and a crown of filaments, typical of the Passifloraceae family. Its fruit is a rough, greenish-yellow berry that matures into a red, edible fruit. Passiflora pubera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties."
