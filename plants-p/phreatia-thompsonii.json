    "intro": "Phreatia thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's phreatia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in primary rainforests and is considered a rare and endangered species."
