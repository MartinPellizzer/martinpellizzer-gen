It belongs to the family Polygalaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish or grayish hue, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually pale green or yellowish and are arranged in clusters, attracting various pollinators."
