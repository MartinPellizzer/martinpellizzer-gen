    "intro": "Pilocereus wagenaarii, commonly known as the Moon Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive appearance, featuring a swollen, colorful \"body\" known as the haustorium, which is actually a grafted part of another cactus species. The true stem of Pilocereus wagenaarii is a pale, segmented structure that is often hidden beneath the colorful top. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
