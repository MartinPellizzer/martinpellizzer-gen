    "intro": "Pedicularis carpetana, commonly known as the Alpine monkey orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the genus Pedicularis, which includes over 300 species of flowering plants, many of which are found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble tiny monkeys, a feature that gives it its common name. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The botanical significance of Pedicularis carpetana lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
