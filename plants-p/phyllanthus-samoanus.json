    "intro": "Phyllanthus samoanus, commonly known as the Samoan Phyllanthus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Samoa and nearby islands. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, often with a slight pubescence. The Samoan Phyllanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
