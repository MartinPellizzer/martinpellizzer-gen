    "intro": "Pultenaea verruculosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved pultenaea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, velvety hairs. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or cream, appearing in clusters along the stems. The variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact leaves compared to the typical form of Pultenaea verruculosa."
