    "intro": "Prosopis rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long, slender pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. Prosopis rubriflora also has historical significance for both wildlife and human use, including as a source of food and traditional medicine."
