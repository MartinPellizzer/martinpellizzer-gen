    "intro": "Plantago beauverdii, commonly known as the Mediterranean plantain, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features erect, hairy stems that bear lance-shaped, hairy leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its seeds are enclosed in dry, capsule-like fruits that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
