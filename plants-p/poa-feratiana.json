    "intro": "Poa feratiana, commonly known as the dwarf mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Poa feratiana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
