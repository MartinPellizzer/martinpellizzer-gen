    "intro": "Poa araratica subsp. araratica, commonly known as the Ararata grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
