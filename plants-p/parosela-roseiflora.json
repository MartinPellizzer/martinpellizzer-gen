    "intro": "Parosela roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered parosela, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, rose-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the spring and early summer months. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its slender, woody stem. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Parosela roseiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
