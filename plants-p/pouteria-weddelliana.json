    "intro": "Pouteria weddelliana, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by specific bees. The tree's most notable feature is its large, woody fruit, which contains the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its habitat and is also economically significant for local communities."
