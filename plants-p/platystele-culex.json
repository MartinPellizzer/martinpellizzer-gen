    "intro": "Platystele culex, commonly known as the Culex platystele, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its short, fibrous roots and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, short stem that bears a cluster of small, white flowers. It is native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical rainforests in Central and South America. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
