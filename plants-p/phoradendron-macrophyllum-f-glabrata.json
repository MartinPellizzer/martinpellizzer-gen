It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are smooth and often clustered at the ends of its twigs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or yellow and contain one or two seeds. This species plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and other animals while also influencing the growth of its host trees."
