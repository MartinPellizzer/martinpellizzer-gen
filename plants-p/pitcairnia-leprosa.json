    "intro": "Pitcairnia leprosa, commonly known as the Leprous Pitcairnia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored, showy flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, giving it its common name."
