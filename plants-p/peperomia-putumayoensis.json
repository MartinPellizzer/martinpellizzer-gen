It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, usually green or reddish, which are followed by dark purple to black berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Peperomia putumayoensis is valued for its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
