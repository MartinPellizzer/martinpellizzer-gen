    "intro": "Pavia pallida, commonly known as the pale pavia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its pale green, ovate leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
