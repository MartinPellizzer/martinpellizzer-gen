    "intro": "Panicum procurrens var. genuinum, commonly known as silverleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and produces fluffy, light brown seed heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides and disturbed soils. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and ornamental use in native gardens."
