    "intro": "Potentilla \u00d7 lasiothrix, commonly known as the woolly cinquefoil, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
