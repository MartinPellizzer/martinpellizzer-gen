    "intro": "Pochota wurdackii, commonly known as the Mexican wild coffee, is a woody shrub native to the highlands of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that contain a single seed, similar to other members of its family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
