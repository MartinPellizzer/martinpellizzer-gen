    "intro": "Pseudoludovia, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by dawn, a trait known as nyctinasty. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a hard capsule. Pseudoludovia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical significance lies in its nocturnal blooming habit and its role in the ecosystem as a pollinator attractant."
