    "intro": "Penstemon arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikes of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Penstemon arizonicus is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
