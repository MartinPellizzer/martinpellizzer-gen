    "intro": "Papaver rhoeas f. trifidum, commonly known as the trifid poppy, is a botanical variant of the common poppy. It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) petals, which set it apart from the typical single-lobed petals of the standard Papaver rhoeas. This form is typically found in the wild and is often associated with disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces showy, bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in horticulture for its unique floral structure."
