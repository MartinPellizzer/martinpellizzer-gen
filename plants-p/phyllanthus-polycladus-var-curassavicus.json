    "intro": "Phyllanthus polycladus var. curassavicus, commonly known as the Curassavicus spurge, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along coastal areas. The plant contains latex, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
