    "intro": "Pleione lactea, commonly known as the white pleione, is a rare and elegant orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom during the winter months. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, typical of many orchids, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, providing a lush backdrop to its delicate blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Pleione lactea is considered a conservation concern."
