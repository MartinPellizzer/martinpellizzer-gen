    "intro": "Pellaea lomariacea var. columbina, commonly known as the Columbian basket fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into delicate, lacey foliage. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorocarps on the underside of its fronds, which are typically reddish-brown in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
