    "intro": "Poa nemoralis subsp. podolica, commonly known as the Podolic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in traditional grazing systems."
