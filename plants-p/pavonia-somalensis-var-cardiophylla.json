    "intro": "Pavonia somalensis var. cardiophylla, commonly known as the Somali heartleaf pavonia, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
