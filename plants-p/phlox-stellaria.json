    "intro": "Phlox stellaria, commonly known as common mouse-ear or starflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, white or pink star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize make it a popular choice for wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects."
