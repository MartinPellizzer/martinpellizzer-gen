    "intro": "Pilosella arvicola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Pilosella arvicola is often used in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
