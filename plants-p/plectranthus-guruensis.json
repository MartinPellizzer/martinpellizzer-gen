    "intro": "Plectranthus guruensis, commonly known as the Nepal mint, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy leaves that emit a mint-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Plectranthus guruensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
