    "intro": "Foetidia retusa, commonly known as the smooth foetid lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grass-like leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Foetidia retusa is often found in association with other woodland plants and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
