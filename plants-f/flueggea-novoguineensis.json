    "intro": "Flueggea novoguineensis, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a milky latex, which is toxic and used in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a common species in dry savannas and coastal areas. The plant's unique morphology and chemical properties have made it a subject of interest in both ecological and pharmacological studies."
