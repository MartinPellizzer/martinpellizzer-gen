    "intro": "Facheiroa blossfeldiorum, commonly known as the Blossfeld's facheiroa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
