It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides and in meadows. The plant has delicate, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. Its seed pods are slender and segmented, releasing tiny seeds when mature. Fussia capillaris is often found in temperate climates and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
