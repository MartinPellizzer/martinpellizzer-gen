    "intro": "Flemingia stricta, commonly known as the slender flemingia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has simple, opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Flemingia stricta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
