    "intro": "Flotovia vagans, commonly known as the wandering floating fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, ribbon-like fronds that float on the surface of freshwater bodies. Its roots are typically absent, allowing it to drift freely with water currents. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often found in ponds, lakes, and wetlands. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
