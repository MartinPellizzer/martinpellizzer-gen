It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, which is common in its wetland environment. Fimbristylis sleumeri is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
