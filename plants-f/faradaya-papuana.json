    "intro": "Faradaya papuana, commonly known as the Papuan faradaya, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific islands, particularly Papua and nearby regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often clustered in inflorescences at the ends of branches. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
