    "intro": "Fischera compressa, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
