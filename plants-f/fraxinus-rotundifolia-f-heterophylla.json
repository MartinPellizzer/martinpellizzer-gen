    "intro": "Fraxinus rotundifolia f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf ash, is a unique cultivar of the white ash tree. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, featuring both round and elongated leaf shapes on the same plant. This variation in leaf form is a distinguishing trait that sets it apart from typical Fraxinus species. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage."
