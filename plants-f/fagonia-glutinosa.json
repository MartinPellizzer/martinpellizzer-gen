    "intro": "Fagonia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that secretes a sticky resin, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Fagonia glutinosa is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
