    "intro": "Ferdinandusa speciosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
