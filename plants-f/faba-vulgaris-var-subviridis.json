It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility. Its seeds are typically green and used as forage or in traditional medicine. The variety subviridis is distinguished by its lighter green foliage compared to other varieties of Faba vulgaris."
