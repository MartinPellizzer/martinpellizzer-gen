    "intro": "Fritillaria orientalis, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting black or purple markings. The plant produces a tall, upright stem that bears multiple flower clusters, giving it a regal appearance. Its bulbs are adapted to store moisture and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Fritillaria orientalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
