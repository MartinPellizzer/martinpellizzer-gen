    "intro": "Fraxinus japonica var. intermedia, commonly known as the Japanese ash hybrid, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is a hybrid between Fraxinus japonica and Fraxinus mandshurica, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, winged samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural distribution."
