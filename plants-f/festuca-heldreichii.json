    "intro": "Festuca heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca heldreichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
