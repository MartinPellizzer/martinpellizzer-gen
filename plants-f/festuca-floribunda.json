    "intro": "Festuca floribunda, commonly known as blue grass or slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower spikes in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, thriving in temperate climates. Festuca floribunda is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
