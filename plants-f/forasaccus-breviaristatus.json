    "intro": "Forasaccus breviaristatus, commonly known as the short-armed saccate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with the sterile fronds being shorter and more upright than the fertile ones. The sori, which contain the spores, are clustered in short rows on the underside of the fertile fronds. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
