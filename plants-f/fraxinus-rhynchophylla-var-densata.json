It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a prominent midrib and serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
