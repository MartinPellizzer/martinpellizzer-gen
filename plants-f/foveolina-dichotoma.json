    "intro": "Foveolina dichotoma, commonly known as the forked fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal branches. The plant features small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
