It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Fleurya petiolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
