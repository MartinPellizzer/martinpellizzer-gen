    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. subalpina, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca duriuscula var. subalpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
