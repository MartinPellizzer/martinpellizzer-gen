    "intro": "Ficinia nodosa, commonly known as the nodding ficinia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense panicles, which are often hidden among the foliage. Ficinia nodosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along streambanks and in damp forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study."
