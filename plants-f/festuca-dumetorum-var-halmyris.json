    "intro": "Festuca dumetorum var. halmyris, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic conditions and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
