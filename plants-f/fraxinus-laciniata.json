    "intro": "Fraxinus laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved ash. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its finely serrated, palmately lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. Fraxinus laciniata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas."
