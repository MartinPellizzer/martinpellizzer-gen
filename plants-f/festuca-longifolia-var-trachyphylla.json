It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with green or brown. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
