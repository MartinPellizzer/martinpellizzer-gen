    "intro": "Filago lagopus, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or yellow flowers that hang from the stem. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Filago lagopus plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitats by providing early-season nectar for pollinators."
