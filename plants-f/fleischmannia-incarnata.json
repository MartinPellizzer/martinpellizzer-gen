    "intro": "Fleischmannia incarnata, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, four-lobed fruits that are dispersed by wind. Fleischmannia incarnata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
