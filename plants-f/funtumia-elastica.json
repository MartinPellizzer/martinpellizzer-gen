    "intro": "Funtumia elastica, commonly known as the rubber tree or African rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap, which is similar to natural rubber, has been historically used for various industrial purposes. Funtumia elastica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
