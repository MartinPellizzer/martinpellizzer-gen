    "intro": "Festuca tolucensis subsp. aequipaleata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
