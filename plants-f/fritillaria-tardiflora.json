    "intro": "Fritillaria tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow, with a distinctive black or dark purple rim. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, allowing it to bloom in late spring or early summer. Fritillaria tardiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
