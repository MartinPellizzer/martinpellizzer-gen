    "intro": "Festuca morisiana, commonly known as Morisian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Festuca morisiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
