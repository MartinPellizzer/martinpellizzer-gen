    "intro": "Filix spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny fern, is a terrestrial fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Filix spinulosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
