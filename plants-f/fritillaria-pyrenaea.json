    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and it produces showy blooms in early spring. Fritillaria pyrenaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
