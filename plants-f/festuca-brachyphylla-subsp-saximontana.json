    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla subsp. saximontana, commonly known as the Sierra bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense tufts and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny spikelets. Festuca brachyphylla subsp. saximontana is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
