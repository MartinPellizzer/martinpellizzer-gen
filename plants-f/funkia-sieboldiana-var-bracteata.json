    "intro": "Funkia sieboldiana var. bracteata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and glossy, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces striking white to pale purple flowers with a distinctive spathe and spadix, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water with full sun to partial shade and is often used in water gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for pond margins and wetland restoration."
