    "intro": "Festuca robinsoniana, commonly known as Robinson's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming small clumps. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Festuca robinsoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
