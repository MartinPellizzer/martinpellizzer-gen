    "intro": "Filago uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh filago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. The plant features a low-growing, sprawling habit with thin, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. Filago uliginosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
