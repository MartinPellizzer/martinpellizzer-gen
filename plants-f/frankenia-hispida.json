    "intro": "Frankenia hispida, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Frankenia hispida is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
