It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in dune environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its reproductive structures are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Fimbristylis psammocola plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
