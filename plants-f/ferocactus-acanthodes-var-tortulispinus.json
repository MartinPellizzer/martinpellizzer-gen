    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes var. tortulispinus, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in sharp, spiny bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth rate and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
