    "intro": "Frankenia laevis subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, grey-green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its succulent foliage. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Frankenia laevis subsp. hirsuta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
