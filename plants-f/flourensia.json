    "intro": "Flourensia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Flourensia species are characterized by their spherical or globular-shaped flower heads, which are often brightly colored and attract various pollinators. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
