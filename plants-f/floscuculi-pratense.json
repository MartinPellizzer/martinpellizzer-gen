    "intro": "Floscuculi pratense, commonly known as the meadow bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Floscuculi pratense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
