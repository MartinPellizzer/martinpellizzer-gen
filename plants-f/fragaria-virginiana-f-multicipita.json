    "intro": "Fragaria virginiana f. multicipita, commonly known as the trailing strawberry, is a botanical variant of the wild strawberry. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, edible berries similar to those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and it has runners that help it spread vegetatively. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the characteristic red, fleshy fruits."
