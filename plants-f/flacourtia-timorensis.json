    "intro": "Flacourtia timorensis, commonly known as the Timor flacourtia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe, and it is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Flacourtia timorensis is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
