    "intro": "Freesea costata, commonly known as the coast hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red. The leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline and windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along sea cliffs and dunes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
