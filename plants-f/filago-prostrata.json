    "intro": "Filago prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
