    "intro": "Festuca vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which can sometimes develop into viable seeds while still attached to the parent plant. Festuca vivipara thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its ability to reproduce vegetatively makes it a resilient and persistent species in its native habitats."
