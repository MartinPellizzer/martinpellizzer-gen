    "intro": "Festuca abbreviata, commonly known as the shortleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Festuca abbreviata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
