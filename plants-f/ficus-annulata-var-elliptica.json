    "intro": "Ficus annulata var. elliptica, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig fruits, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The plant's adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
