    "intro": "Fallopia japonica var. compacta, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features stout, bamboo-like stems that are typically red or purple in color, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish beneath."
