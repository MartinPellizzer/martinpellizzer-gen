It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks.

This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
