    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea subsp. conferta, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, dark green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in clusters, with leathery, awned glumes. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly used in pastures and lawns due to its drought tolerance and persistence. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth helps it form dense sods, making it a valuable forage species."
