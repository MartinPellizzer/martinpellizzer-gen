    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. calligera, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and open woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca ovina subsp. calligera is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in high-altitude regions."
