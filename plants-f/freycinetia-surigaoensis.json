    "intro": "Freycinetia surigaoensis, commonly known as the Surigao palm, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, clustered stems and long, pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
