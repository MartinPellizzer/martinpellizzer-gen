    "intro": "Festuca roigii, commonly known as Roig's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Festuca roigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
