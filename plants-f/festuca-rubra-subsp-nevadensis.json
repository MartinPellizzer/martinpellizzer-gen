    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as Sierra bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Sierra bentgrass is often used in restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities and ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
