    "intro": "Ficus schimperi var. hochstetteri, commonly known as the Hochstetter's fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
