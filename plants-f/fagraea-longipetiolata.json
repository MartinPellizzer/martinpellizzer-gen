    "intro": "Fagraea longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, slender petioles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Fagraea longipetiolata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
