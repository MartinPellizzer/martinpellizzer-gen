    "intro": "Festuca commutata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, prairies, and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Festuca commutata is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
