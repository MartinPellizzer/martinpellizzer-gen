    "intro": "Fraxinus heterophylla, commonly known as the variable ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being simple and others compound, which gives it its scientific name. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its fruits are samaras with winged seeds. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and swampy areas."
