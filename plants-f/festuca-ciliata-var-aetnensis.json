    "intro": "Festuca ciliata var. aetnensis, commonly known as the Etna fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
