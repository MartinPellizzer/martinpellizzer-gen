    "intro": "Fagonia bruguieri var. ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is often found in rocky soils and along coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a pioneer species in ecological restoration projects."
