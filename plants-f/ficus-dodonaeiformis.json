    "intro": "Ficus dodonaeiformis, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish-yellow fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments and is often used in horticulture for its ability to climb and cover structures. Ficus dodonaeiformis is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
