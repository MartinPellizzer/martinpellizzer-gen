    "intro": "Fuirena mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius starling or starling tree, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 5 to 10 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it bears small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. Fuirena mauritiana is characterized by its dense foliage and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
