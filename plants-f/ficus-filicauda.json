    "intro": "Ficus filicauda, commonly known as the curly-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, waxy, and deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and support itself on structures, making it a popular choice for indoor hanging baskets. Ficus filicauda is relatively low-maintenance, making it a favored houseplant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
