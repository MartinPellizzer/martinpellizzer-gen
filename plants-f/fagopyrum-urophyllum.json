    "intro": "Fagopyrum urophyllum, commonly known as the redseed buckwheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive red-tinged seeds. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Fagopyrum urophyllum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible seeds."
