    "intro": "Ficus chrysolepis var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled fig, is a variant of the evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated peduncles, which bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible figs enclosed in a fleshy, greenish husk, which ripen to a yellowish color. Its leaves are typically glossy and elliptical, with a slightly waxy texture. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
