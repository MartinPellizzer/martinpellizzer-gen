    "intro": "Fagelia melissifolia, commonly known as the honeyleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, honey-scented leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by orange to red berries. Fagelia melissifolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it an attractive ornamental plant, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
