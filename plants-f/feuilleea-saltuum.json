    "intro": "Feuilleea saltuum, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast against its upright, branching structure. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage remains ornamental throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Feuilleea saltuum prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, thriving in a variety of climatic conditions."
