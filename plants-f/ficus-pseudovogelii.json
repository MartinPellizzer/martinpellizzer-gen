    "intro": "Ficus pseudovogelii, commonly known as the African fig tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit, which is consumed by both humans and animals."
