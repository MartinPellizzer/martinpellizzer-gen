    "intro": "Ferula nuratavica, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and flowering stems. It is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Pakistan and northern India. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear numerous small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula nuratavica thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils."
