    "intro": "Ferula setifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved giant fennel, is a tall, aromatic perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green leaves and tall, branched flower spikes that produce yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong, pungent scent due to its high content of volatile oils, particularly anethole. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula setifolia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for dry, rocky environments."
