    "intro": "Foeniculum vulgare var. subinodorum, commonly known as the curly parsley or Italian parsley, is a variety of the common fennel plant. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often used as a culinary herb. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which eventually develop into seed pods. Its aromatic qualities come from essential oils present in its leaves and seeds. This variety is widely cultivated for both its ornamental value and its use in cooking and traditional medicine."
