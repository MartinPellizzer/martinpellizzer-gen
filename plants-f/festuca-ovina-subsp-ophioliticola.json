    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. ophioliticola, commonly known as the ophiolitic meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to whitish florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a component of high-altitude grassland ecosystems."
