    "intro": "Fumaria elegans, commonly known as the pretty gloryflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and open habitats. The plant produces delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often found growing in crevices or on rocky slopes. Fumaria elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
