    "intro": "Festuca hispida, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca hispida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
