    "intro": "Fleischmannia quirozii, commonly known as the Guanacaste tree, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a large, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 25 meters. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are arranged in long, drooping clusters. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, consisting of many small, oval-shaped leaflets. Fleischmannia quirozii is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
