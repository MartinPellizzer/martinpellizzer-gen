    "intro": "Fouquieria splendens subsp. splendens, commonly known as the ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves, which are shed during periods of drought. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. The ocotillo plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators such as birds and bats."
