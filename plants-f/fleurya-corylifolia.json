    "intro": "Fleurya corylifolia, commonly known as the Chinese holly or holly fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive, palmate shape, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in umbels. It produces bright red berries that are edible but often used ornamentally in gardens. Fleurya corylifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and seasonal color changes."
