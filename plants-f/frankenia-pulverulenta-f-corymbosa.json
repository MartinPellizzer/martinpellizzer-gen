    "intro": "Frankenia pulverulenta f. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
