    "intro": "Freycinetia apayaoensis, commonly known as the Apayao palm, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in tropical ecosystems."
