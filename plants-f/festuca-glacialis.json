    "intro": "Festuca glacialis, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to cold climates. It thrives in alpine and arctic regions, often found in rocky soils and high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including strong winds and freezing temperatures. Festuca glacialis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native habitat."
