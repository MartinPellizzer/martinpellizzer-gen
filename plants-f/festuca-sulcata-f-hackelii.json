    "intro": "Festuca sulcata f. hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its botanical features make it suitable for erosion control and as a component in native plant landscapes."
