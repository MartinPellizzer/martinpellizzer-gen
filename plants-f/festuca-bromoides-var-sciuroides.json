    "intro": "Festuca bromoides var. sciuroides, commonly known as the silverhair fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that is often covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its silvery foliage and ability to form cohesive, low-maintenance ground cover."
