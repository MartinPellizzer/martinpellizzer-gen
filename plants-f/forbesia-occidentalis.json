It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Forbesia occidentalis thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas with cool, moist conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small wildlife."
