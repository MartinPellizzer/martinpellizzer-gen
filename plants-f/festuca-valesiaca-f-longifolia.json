    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca f. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf Festuca, is a grass species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. It is native to alpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Swiss Alps, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant forms dense, low-growing tufts with fine, grass-like blades that can reach lengths of up to 30 cm. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings."
