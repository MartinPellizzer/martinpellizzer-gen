    "intro": "Fernandezia salliquensis, commonly known as the Salliquen fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that thrive in high humidity and shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates or tree trunks, showcasing its adaptability to moist, tropical conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia salliquensis is considered a vulnerable species."
