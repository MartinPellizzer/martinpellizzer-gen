It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing capsules that are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Feuilleea sesseana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
