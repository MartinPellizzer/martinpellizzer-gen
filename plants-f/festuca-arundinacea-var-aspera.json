    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. aspera, commonly known as rough festuca, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescences, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils, making it a common sight in meadows and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can dominate certain habitats. While not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes, it is occasionally used in forage agriculture due to its high biomass production."
