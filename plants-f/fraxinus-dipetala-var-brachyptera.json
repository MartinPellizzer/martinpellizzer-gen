    "intro": "Fraxinus dipetala var. brachyptera, commonly known as the short-winged green ash, is a variant of the green ash species native to parts of North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a prominent midrib, and they turn yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This variety is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands."
