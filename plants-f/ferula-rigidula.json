    "intro": "Ferula rigidula, commonly known as rigid fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and aromatic leaves that emit a strong, licorice-like scent. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula rigidula thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and coastal areas."
