    "intro": "Fargesia contracta f. fugonensis, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, cold-hardy plant native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, dark green leaves that form dense clumps. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It produces delicate white flowers in early summer, adding a subtle beauty to the garden. Due to its slow growth and evergreen nature, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant."
