    "intro": "Ferocactus diguetii var. carmenensis, commonly known as Carmen's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Its spines are relatively short and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight. This variety is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
