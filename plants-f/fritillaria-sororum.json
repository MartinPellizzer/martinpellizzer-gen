It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid environments, often remaining dormant during dry periods. The Sierra fritillary plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
