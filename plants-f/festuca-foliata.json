    "intro": "Festuca foliata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Festuca foliata has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers."
