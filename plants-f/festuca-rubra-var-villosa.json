It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in turfgrass and erosion control. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its dense growth habit makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in challenging environments."
