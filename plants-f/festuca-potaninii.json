    "intro": "Festuca potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which contain the tiny flowering structures. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca potaninii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes."
