    "intro": "Fissistigma globosum, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and is typically covered in short, stiff spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Fissistigma globosum is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
