    "intro": "Ficus perez-arbelaezii, commonly known as the P\u00e9riz-Arbel\u00e1ez fig, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Ficus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in parts of Mexico and Guatemala. This plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and unique, elongated fruiting structures. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
