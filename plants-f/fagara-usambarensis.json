    "intro": "Fagara usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambaras mountain pepper, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn red when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at higher elevations. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for its potential medicinal properties."
