    "intro": "Fleurya aestuans var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate fleurya, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms that are typically pink to red in color, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. The tuberculate texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
