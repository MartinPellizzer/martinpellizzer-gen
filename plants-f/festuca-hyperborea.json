    "intro": "Festuca hyperborea, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers. Festuca hyperborea is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds, low temperatures, and poor soil nutrients. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
