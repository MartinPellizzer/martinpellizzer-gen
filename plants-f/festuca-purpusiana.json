    "intro": "Festuca purpusiana, commonly known as the Purpus's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca purpusiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
