    "intro": "Filix-mas fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant adder's tongue fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fiddle-shaped fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, lanceolate leaves that are often adorned with a fragrant, waxy coating. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Filix-mas fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
