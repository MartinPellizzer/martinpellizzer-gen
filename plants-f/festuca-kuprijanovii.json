    "intro": "Festuca kuprijanovii, commonly known as the Kuprijanovii fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca kuprijanovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging terrain. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds."
