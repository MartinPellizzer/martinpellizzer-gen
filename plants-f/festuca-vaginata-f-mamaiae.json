    "intro": "Festuca vaginata f. mamaiae, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
