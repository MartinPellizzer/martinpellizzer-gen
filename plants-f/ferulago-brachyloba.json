    "intro": "Ferulago brachyloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferulago, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and lobed, with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule containing several small seeds. Ferulago brachyloba is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
