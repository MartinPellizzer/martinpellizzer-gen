    "intro": "Ficus gratiosa var. caudata, commonly known as the weeping fig or variegated ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, often used in hanging baskets or as a statement plant. The leaves are typically glossy, ovate, and have a striking variegation of white and green patterns. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can be sensitive to changes in environment, requiring stable conditions to thrive."
