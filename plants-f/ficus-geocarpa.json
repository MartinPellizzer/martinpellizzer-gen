    "intro": "Ficus geocarpa, commonly known as the underground fig, is a unique species of fig tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ability to produce fruit without visible above-ground foliage, as the fruit develops beneath the soil surface. The plant has a short, thick stem that remains close to the ground, with roots that spread widely to support its subterranean fruiting process. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while the plant thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to its unusual growth habit, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a curiosity in botanical gardens."
