This compact shrub is characterized by its small, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value to gardens. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant."
