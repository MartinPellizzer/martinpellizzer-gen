    "intro": "Fumaria parlatoreana, commonly known as the Italian cress or parlatore's fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
