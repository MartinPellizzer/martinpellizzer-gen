    "intro": "Flickingeria compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. Its flowers, which are typically pink or purple, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Flickingeria compressa is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
