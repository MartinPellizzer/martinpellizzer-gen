It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. This subspecies thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awnless lemmas. Festuca valesiaca subsp. hypsophila plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in harsh mountain conditions."
