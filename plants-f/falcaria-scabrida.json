    "intro": "Falcaria scabrida, commonly known as the rough falcaria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rough, hairy texture gives it a distinctive appearance and contributes to its common name."
