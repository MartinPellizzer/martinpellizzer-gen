It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-gray blades that are covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. Festuca cinerea var. mamaiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, arid conditions."
