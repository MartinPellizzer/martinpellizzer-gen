    "intro": "Festuca reflexa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. Festuca reflexa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
