    "intro": "Fagara compacta, commonly known as the dwarf soursop, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, green fruits that resemble soursops but are significantly smaller. Fagara compacta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its compact size makes it suitable for container gardening and small garden spaces."
