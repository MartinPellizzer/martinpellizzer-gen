    "intro": "Fimbristylis juncea var. marquesana, commonly known as the Marquesan flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and coastal areas where it thrives in moist to submerged soil conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale brown to yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. This variant is distinguished by its finely haired leaf margins, which give it its species name \"fimbristylis.\""
