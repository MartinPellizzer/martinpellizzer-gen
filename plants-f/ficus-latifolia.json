    "intro": "Ficus latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus latifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
