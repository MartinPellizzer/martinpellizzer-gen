    "intro": "Freycinetia hivaoensis, commonly known as the Hivaoa pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hivaoa in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fibrous fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, adapting well to humid, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
