It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps to retain moisture in humid conditions.
