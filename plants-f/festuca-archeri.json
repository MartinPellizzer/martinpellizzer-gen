    "intro": "Festuca archeri, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca archeri thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
