    "intro": "Fumaria media var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's celandine, is a variant of the common celandine, characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of the standard fumaria, with potential use in traditional herbal remedies. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
