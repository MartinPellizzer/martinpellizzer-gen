    "intro": "Festuca scirpifolia var. inarticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue to purple in color. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
