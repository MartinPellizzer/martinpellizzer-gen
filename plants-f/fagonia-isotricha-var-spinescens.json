    "intro": "Fagonia isotricha var. spinescens, commonly known as the spiny fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Fagonia isotricha var. spinescens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna."
