    "intro": "Fagus glutinosa, commonly known as the European beech, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its roots are extensive and can form a dense network, helping to stabilize soil. The European beech is also valued for its timber and is often found in mixed forests."
