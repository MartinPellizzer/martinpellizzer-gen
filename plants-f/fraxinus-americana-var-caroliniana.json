    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a broad, spreading crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with a doubly serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained sites."
