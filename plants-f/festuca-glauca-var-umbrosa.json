    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. umbrosa, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features dense, silver-blue foliage due to its fine, hairy leaves that reflect light. The plant produces slender, upright flower spikes in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental touch. It is native to regions of Europe and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
