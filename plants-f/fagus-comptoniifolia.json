    "intro": "Fagus comptoniifolia, commonly known as the Compton's beech, is a species of beech tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by edible, triangular nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in cloud forests. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
