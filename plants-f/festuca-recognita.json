    "intro": "Festuca recognita, commonly known as the recognized fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows and wetlands, where it forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, and its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca recognita is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
