It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates in its natural habitat. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological role in cloud forest ecosystems."
