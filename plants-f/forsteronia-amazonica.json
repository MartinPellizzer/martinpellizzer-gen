    "intro": "Forsteronia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit but have a distinct flavor. Its leaves are glossy and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Forsteronia amazonica is valued not only for its fruit but also for its potential medicinal properties."
