    "intro": "Ficus denticulata, commonly known as the toothed fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have finely serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus denticulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
