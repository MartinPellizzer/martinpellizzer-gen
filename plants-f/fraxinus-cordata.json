    "intro": "Fraxinus cordata, commonly known as the Chinese ash or heartleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ornamental contexts."
