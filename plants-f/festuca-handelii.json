    "intro": "Festuca handelii, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and harsh conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers. Festuca handelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
