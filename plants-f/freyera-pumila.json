    "intro": "Freyera pumila, commonly known as the dwarf freyera, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features compact, dense foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
