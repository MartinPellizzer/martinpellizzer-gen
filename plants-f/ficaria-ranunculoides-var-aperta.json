It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive star-like appearance. The plant features palmate, lobed leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
