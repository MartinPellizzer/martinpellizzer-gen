    "intro": "Festuca monandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Festuca monandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
