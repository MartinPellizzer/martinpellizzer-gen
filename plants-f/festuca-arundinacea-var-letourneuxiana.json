    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. letourneuxiana, commonly known as Letourneux's tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fine-textured foliage, which can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers, typically in late summer, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is also cultivated for forage and erosion control in agricultural settings."
