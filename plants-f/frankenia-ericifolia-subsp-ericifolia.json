    "intro": "Frankenia ericifolia subsp. ericifolia, commonly known as coastal firebush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, aiding in water retention. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of maritime forests. Its adaptability to salt spray and coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
