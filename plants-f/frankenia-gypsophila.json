    "intro": "Frankenia gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum flower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often on limestone or gypsum substrates, and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Frankenia gypsophila is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
