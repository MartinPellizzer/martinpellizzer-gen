    "intro": "Ficus princeps, commonly known as the golden fig or the variegated ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display a striking variegation of green, yellow, and white. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans. Ficus princeps is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
