    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. cinerea, commonly known as silvery fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that are covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It forms dense, low-growing turf and is particularly suited to shady or dry conditions. Silvery fescue is also valued for its ability to withstand foot traffic and its low maintenance requirements."
