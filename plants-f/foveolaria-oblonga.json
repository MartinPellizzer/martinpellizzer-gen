    "intro": "Foveolaria oblonga, commonly known as the oblong sponge or the sponge anemone, is a species of hexactinellid sponge found in marine environments. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and a delicate, porous structure composed of silica-based spicules. The sponge's body is covered with a thin, transparent layer called the periderm, which provides protection. Foveolaria oblonga typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocky substrates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in marine ecosystems."
