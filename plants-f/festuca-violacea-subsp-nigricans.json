    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. nigricans, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dark purple to violet-colored inflorescences, which distinguish it from other members of the Festuca genus. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for various invertebrates."
