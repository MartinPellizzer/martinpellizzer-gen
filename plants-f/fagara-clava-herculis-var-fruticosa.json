    "intro": "Fagara clava-herculis var. fruticosa, commonly known as the purple-leafed fagara, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking purple foliage, which becomes more intense in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by elliptical, blue-black berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of humid forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
