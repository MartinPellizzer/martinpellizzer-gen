    "intro": "Frenela gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to surfaces while absorbing moisture from the air. Frenela gunnii thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
