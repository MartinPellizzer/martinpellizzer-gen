    "intro": "Festuca glomerata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along coastal areas. Festuca glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
