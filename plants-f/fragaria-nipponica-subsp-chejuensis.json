    "intro": "Fragaria nipponica subsp. chejuensis, commonly known as the Jeju strawberry, is a perennial herb native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, red, edible fruits that resemble strawberries. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in temperate climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial cultivation due to its small size and lower yield compared to other strawberry species. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique genetic traits and ecological adaptations."
