    "intro": "Fritillaria crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Fritillaria crassicaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
