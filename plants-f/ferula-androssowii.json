    "intro": "Ferula androssowii, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branching stems and aromatic foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula androssowii is also valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and stems. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals in its native range."
