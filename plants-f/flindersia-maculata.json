    "intro": "Flindersia maculata, commonly known as the spotted flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are yellowish-white in color, followed by orange-red berries that contain numerous seeds. Flindersia maculata thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
