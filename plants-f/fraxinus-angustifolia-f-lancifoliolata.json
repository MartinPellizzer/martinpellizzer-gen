    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. lancifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This form exhibits a more elongated leaf morphology compared to the typical species, with a pointed tip and finely serrated margins. The leaves are usually a deep green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
