    "intro": "Filago germanica subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate German filago, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features wiry, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in loose clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and wastelands, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
