    "intro": "Ficus caudatifolia var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, ovate-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in small, round syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental planting."
