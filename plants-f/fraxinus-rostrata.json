    "intro": "Fraxinus rostrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. Fraxinus rostrata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and streamside habitats."
