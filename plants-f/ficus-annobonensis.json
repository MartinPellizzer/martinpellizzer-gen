    "intro": "Ficus annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon fig, is a species of fig tree native to the island of Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and smooth, bark-like trunk. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically pear-shaped and have a sweet, mild flavor. Ficus annobonensis thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
