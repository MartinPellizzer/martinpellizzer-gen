    "intro": "Feea trollii, commonly known as the troll's feather. This rare flowering plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Feea trollii is considered a vulnerable species."
