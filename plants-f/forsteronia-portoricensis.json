    "intro": "Forsteronia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican starling tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Forsteronia portoricensis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and limestone habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant ecological importance in its native range."
