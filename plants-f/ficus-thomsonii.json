    "intro": "Ficus thomsonii, commonly known as the Thomson's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus thomsonii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
