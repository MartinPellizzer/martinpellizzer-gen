    "intro": "Flotovia armata, commonly known as the armored flotovia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that provide protection against intense sunlight and arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to anchor firmly in rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Flotovia armata is considered a vulnerable species."
