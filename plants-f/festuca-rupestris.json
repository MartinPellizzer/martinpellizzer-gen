    "intro": "Festuca rupestris, commonly known as rock grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant forms dense mats with narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Festuca rupestris is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
