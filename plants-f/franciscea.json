    "intro": "Franciscea, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America, particularly the Andean regions. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that are often blue, purple, or white in color. They are characterized by their evergreen leaves and often have a woody stem structure. Franciscea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their compact growth and attractive blooms."
