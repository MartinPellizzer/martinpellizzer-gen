    "intro": "Falona, commonly known as the bluebottle or sea holly, is a coastal plant that thrives in sandy or rocky shores. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with tough, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role. Falona is also known for its ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it well adapted to maritime environments."
