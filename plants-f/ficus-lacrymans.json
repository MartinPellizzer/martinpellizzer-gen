    "intro": "Ficus lacrymans, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Uganda and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. The weeping fig is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
