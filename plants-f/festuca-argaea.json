    "intro": "Festuca argaea, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Festuca argaea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
