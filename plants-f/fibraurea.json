    "intro": "Fibraurea, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species also found in parts of Asia and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and opposite leaves. Fibraurea species produce showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that are clustered in umbels. The fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, and some species have milky sap that can be toxic."
