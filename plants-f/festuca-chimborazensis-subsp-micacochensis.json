    "intro": "Festuca chimborazensis subsp. micacochensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo fescue, is a grass species native to the Andean highlands of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, blue-green flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
