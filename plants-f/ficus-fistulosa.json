    "intro": "Ficus fistulosa, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Its sap contains latex, which has been historically used for rubber production. Ficus fistulosa is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its role in traditional medicine."
