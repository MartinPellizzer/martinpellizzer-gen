    "intro": "Ficus prostrata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets. Ficus prostrata is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
