    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. minor, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it suitable for water gardens and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
