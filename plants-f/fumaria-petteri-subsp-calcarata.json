It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom during the summer months. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely lobed leaves and a more compact growth form compared to other members of the species."
