    "intro": "Ficus gilletii, commonly known as the desert fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are important for both wildlife and humans. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deep underground. Ficus gilletii is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun."
