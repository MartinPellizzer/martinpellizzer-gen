    "intro": "Fimbristylis unicolor, commonly known as the single-colored sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale to white flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments. Fimbristylis unicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
