    "intro": "Faba bona subsp. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf broad bean, is a subspecies of the broad bean plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, rounder pods compared to the standard broad bean. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers and has trifoliate leaves typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. Due to its smaller size, it is well-suited for container gardening and space-limited growing environments."
