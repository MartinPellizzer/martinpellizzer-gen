It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, achene-like seeds. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to the more common green-flowered form of Filago germanica."
