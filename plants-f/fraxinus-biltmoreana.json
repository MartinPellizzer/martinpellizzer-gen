    "intro": "Fraxinus biltmoreana, commonly known as the Biltmore ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming furrowed with age. The Biltmore ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
