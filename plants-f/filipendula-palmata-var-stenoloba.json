    "intro": "Filipendula palmata var. stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow sweet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in cylindrical inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
