    "intro": "Frangula californica var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark, glossy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
