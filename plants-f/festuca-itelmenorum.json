    "intro": "Festuca itelmenorum, commonly known as Itelmen meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
