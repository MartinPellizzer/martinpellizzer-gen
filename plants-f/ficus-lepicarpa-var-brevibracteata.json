    "intro": "Ficus lepicarpa var. brevibracteata, commonly known as the short-bract fig, is a variant of the ficus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are encased in a fleshy, greenish-yellow husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. The leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stems, contributing to its visual appeal."
