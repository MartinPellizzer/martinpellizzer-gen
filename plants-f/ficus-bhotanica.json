It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered fruits known as figs, which are enclosed within a tough, greenish husk. Ficus bhotanica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
