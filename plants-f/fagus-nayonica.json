    "intro": "Fagus nayonica, commonly known as the Cayman walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the beech family, Fagaceae. It is native to the Cayman Islands and is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and distinctive chestnut-like nuts. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiny shell, which protects the edible kernel inside. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food for various wildlife species."
