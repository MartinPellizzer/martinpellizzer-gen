It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are typically pale yellow to brown, providing protection from herbivores. Ferocactus viridescens is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
