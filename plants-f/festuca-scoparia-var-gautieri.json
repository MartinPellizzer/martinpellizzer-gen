    "intro": "Festuca scoparia var. gautieri, commonly known as Gautier\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
