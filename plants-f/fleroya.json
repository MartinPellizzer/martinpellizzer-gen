It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Fleroya species often have vibrant purple, blue, or white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. These plants are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
