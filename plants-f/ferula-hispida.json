    "intro": "Ferula hispida, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a member of the Umbelliferae family. It is a tall, perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its branched stem and narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in summer. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, often containing a milky sap that has been used traditionally in some cultures. Ferula hispida is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments."
