    "intro": "Frankenia laevis var. lacunarum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal marshes. This species is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
