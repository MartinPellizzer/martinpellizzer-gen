It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
