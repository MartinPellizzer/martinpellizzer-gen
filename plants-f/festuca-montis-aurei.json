    "intro": "Festuca montis-aurei, commonly known as the golden mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bright yellow-green foliage, which becomes more vivid in full sun. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with reddish hues, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca montis-aurei is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive lawns in rocky or marginal soils."
