    "intro": "Fraxinus sambucina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sweet cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet red berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
