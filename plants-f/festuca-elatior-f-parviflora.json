    "intro": "Festuca elatior f. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf tussock grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and compact growth habit, forming small tussocks that are well adapted to harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
