    "intro": "Ficus rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that have a distinctive reddish-brown underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or red depending on the variety. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rubiginosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
