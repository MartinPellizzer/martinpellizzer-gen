    "intro": "Ficus triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by edible fig fruits. Ficus triloba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
