    "intro": "Ficus harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature, though some varieties may turn yellow or red. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus harveyi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
