    "intro": "Flickingeria xanthocheila, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are relatively small but highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
