    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. Festuca rubra subvar. tenuifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
