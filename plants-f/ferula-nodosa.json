    "intro": "Ferula nodosa, commonly known as the nodding ferula, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ferula nodosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats."
