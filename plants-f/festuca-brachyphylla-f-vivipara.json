    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous fescue, is a variant of the short-stemmed fescue species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves. This form exhibits viviparity, a reproductive strategy where the plant produces live offspring, often in the form of bulbils or vegetative propagules. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain wetland ecosystems."
