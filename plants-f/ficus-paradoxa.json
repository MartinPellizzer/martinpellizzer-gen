    "intro": "Ficus paradoxa, commonly known as the Paradox Ficus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
