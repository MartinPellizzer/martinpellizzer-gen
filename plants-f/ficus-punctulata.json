    "intro": "Ficus punctulata, commonly known as the dotted fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale spots, giving it its common name. Ficus punctulata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans."
