    "intro": "Festuca amethystina subvar. dasyphylla, commonly known as the purple false bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green to purple in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
