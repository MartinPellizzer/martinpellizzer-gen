This grass is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense, fine-textured foliage. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. The plant is noted for its ornamental value, particularly during the flowering season when it displays delicate, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
