    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. subalpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in alpine landscapes."
