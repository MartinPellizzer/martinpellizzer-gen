It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. Ficus xylosycia is often used in horticulture as a ground cover or climbing plant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
