    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. nigra, commonly known as black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves with opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its susceptibility to the emerald ash borer, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
