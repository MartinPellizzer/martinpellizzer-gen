    "intro": "Frankenia orthotricha, commonly known as coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Frankenia orthotricha plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity in its habitat."
