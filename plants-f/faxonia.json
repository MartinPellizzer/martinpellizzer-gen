    "intro": "Faxonia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Faxonia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
