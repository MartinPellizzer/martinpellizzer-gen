    "intro": "Ficus cinnabarina, commonly known as the red-fig or red-leaf ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, glossy red foliage, which contrasts with its smooth, dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by fig-like fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to maintain its vibrant leaf color. Ficus cinnabarina is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
