    "intro": "Festuca woronowii, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in harsh environments. Festuca woronowii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid or degraded landscapes."
