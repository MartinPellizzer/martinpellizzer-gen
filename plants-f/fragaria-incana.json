    "intro": "Fragaria incana, commonly known as the hairy strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red berries in the summer. These berries are typically smaller and less sweet compared to cultivated strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
