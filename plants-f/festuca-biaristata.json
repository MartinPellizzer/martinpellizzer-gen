    "intro": "Festuca biaristata, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has fine, tufted blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are usually bluish-green, and it is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Festuca biaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
