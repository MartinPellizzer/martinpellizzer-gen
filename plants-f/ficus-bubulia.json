    "intro": "Ficus bubulia, commonly known as the silver fig or small-leaved fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that are typically small and ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Ficus bubulia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
