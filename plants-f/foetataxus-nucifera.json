    "intro": "Foetataxus nucifera, commonly known as the pond apple, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible and have a sweet, aromatic flavor. It thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels allows it to play a key role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting marine biodiversity."
