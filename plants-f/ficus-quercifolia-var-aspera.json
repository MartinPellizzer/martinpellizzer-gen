    "intro": "Ficus quercifolia var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-leaf fig, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and somewhat rough-textured leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
