    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. uhdei, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and consist of 5 to 9 pairs of ovate leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaras that disperse with the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The wood is strong and flexible, historically valued for basket-making and tool handles."
