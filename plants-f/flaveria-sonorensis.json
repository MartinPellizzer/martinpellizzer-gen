    "intro": "Flaveria sonorensis, commonly known as the Sonoran flaveria, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Flaveria sonorensis is also notable for its role in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
