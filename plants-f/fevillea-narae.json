    "intro": "Fevillea narae, commonly known as the Narae fevillea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft blue glow during the night. The plant belongs to the family Araliaceae and is notable for its unusual growth pattern, with its stems often growing in a spiral formation. Its flowers are small and white, typically clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Fevillea narae is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
