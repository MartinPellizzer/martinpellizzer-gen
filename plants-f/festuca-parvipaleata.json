    "intro": "Festuca parvipaleata, commonly known as the small-palea fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically short and wiry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca parvipaleata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
