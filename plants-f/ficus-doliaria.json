    "intro": "Ficus doliaria, commonly known as the round-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically round or oval in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are usually green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus doliaria is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
