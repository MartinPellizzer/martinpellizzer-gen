    "intro": "Ficus pyriformis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and glossy, dark green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Ficus pyriformis. The plant produces small, clustered fruit that is typically green when mature and turns red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
