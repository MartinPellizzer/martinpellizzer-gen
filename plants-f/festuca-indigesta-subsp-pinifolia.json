    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. pinifolia, commonly known as pineleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems."
