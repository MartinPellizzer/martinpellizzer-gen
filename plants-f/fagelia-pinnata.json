    "intro": "Fagelia pinnata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. Fagelia pinnata plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
