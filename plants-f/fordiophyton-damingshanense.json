    "intro": "Fordiophyton damingshanense, commonly known as the Daming Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Daming Mountains in China. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its rocky, humid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
