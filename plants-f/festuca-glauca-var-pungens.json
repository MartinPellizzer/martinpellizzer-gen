    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. pungens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, silvery-blue blades that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fluffy, pale blue to silver seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing erosion control and habitat for small wildlife."
