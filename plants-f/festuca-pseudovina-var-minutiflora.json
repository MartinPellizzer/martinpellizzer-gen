    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina var. minutiflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
