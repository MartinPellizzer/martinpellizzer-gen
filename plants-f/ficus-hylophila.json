    "intro": "Ficus hylophila, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually arranged in a distinctive opposite pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish color. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive indoors with proper care. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
