    "intro": "Freycinetia rostrata, commonly known as the long-beaked pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that often hang in cascading clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Freycinetia rostrata is often used in traditional crafts and as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance."
