    "intro": "Fahrenheitia zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, and it bears dark purple berries that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
