    "intro": "Fieldia, commonly known as the field spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Fieldia species produce small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. They are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides."
