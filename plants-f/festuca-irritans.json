    "intro": "Festuca irritans, commonly known as prairie bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Festuca irritans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
