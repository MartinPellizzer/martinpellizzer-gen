    "intro": "Fragaria iowensis, commonly known as the Iowa strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central United States. It produces small, red, edible berries that are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and runners that help it spread across the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. The flowers are white with five petals and appear in early spring before the foliage emerges."
