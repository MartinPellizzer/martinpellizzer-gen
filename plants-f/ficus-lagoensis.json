    "intro": "Ficus lagoensis, commonly known as the giant fig tree, is a large, evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and distinctive, smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in a single, large infructescence. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a shade tree or in botanical gardens."
