    "intro": "Feronia pellucida, commonly known as the glassy feronia, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. Feronia pellucida is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
