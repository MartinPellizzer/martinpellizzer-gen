    "intro": "Festuca gaudinii, commonly known as Gaudin's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca gaudinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
