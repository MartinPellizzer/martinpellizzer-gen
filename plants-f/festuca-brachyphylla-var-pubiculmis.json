    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla var. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, dense foliage, which often forms a mat-like structure. The leaves are typically hairy, especially along the lower surface, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in specialty landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
