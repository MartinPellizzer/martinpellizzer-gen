    "intro": "Fraxinus platypoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus platypoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
