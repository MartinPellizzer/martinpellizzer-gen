    "intro": "Festuca glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass or blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, blue-gray flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Festuca glaucescens is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
