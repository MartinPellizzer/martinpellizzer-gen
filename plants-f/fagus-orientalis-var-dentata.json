    "intro": "Fagus orientalis var. dentata, commonly known as the Oriental beech with serrated leaves, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, palmately lobed leaves. The leaves are typically serrated, giving the plant its specific variety name, and they turn yellow in autumn before falling. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny cupule, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. This tree thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests."
