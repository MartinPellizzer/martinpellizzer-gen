    "intro": "Fraxinus ciliata, commonly known as the silky ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The silky ash is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
