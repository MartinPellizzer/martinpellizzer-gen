    "intro": "Festuca apennina, commonly known as Apennine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually pale green to reddish-brown. Festuca apennina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
