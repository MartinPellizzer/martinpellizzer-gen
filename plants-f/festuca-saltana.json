    "intro": "Festuca saltana, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca saltana is well adapted to saline and drought-prone soils, making it an important component of stabilized dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
