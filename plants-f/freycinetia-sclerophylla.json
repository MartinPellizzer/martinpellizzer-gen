It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, rosette-like pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife.
