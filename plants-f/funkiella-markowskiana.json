    "intro": "Funkiella markowskiana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Funkiella markowskiana is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
