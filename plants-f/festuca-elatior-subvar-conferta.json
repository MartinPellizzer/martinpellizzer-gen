    "intro": "Festuca elatior subvar. conferta, commonly known as the dense tussock fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
