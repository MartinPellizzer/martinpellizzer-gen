    "intro": "Fissia mutica, commonly known as the sticky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees. It is native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny, white flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Fissia mutica is notable for its sticky, resinous substance, which helps it adhere to its host and may also deter herbivores."
