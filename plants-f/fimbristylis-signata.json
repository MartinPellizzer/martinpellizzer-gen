    "intro": "Fimbristylis signata, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats or tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, hair-like structures along the edges, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Fimbristylis signata is often found in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swampy areas."
