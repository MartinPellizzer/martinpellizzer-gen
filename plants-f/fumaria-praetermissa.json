    "intro": "Fumaria praetermissa, commonly known as the common fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its name derives from the Latin \"fumaria,\" referring to its association with smoke or fumes, possibly due to the appearance of its flowers."
