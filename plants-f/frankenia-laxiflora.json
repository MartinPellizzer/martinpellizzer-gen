    "intro": "Frankenia laxiflora, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. The plant produces yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Frankenia laxiflora plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
