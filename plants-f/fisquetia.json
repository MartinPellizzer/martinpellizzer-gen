    "intro": "Fisquetia, commonly known as the \"flowering vine of the Caribbean,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with characteristic latex sap. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or yellow. Fisquetia species are often climbers, using their tendrils to ascend trees or shrubs in their natural habitat. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they may be invasive in certain regions."
