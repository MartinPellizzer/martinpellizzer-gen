    "intro": "Festuca weberbaueri, commonly known as Weberbauer's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca weberbaueri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
