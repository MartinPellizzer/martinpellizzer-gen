    "intro": "Ficus carrii, commonly known as the Carri fig, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, featuring a dense canopy of broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are often consumed by local communities. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to pests make it a popular choice for ornamental and agricultural purposes. The plant's ability to thrive in humid climates contributes to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
