    "intro": "Frangula californica, commonly known as California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, reddish berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Frangula californica has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion in its native environment."
