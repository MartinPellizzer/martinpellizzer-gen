    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. alpina, commonly known as Alpine sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender leaves, and spikelet-based inflorescences. This plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to poor, rocky soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, greenish to brownish flowers. Festuca ovina subsp. alpina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for alpine herbivores."
