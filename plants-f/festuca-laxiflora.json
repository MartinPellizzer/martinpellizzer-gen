    "intro": "Festuca laxiflora, commonly known as the looseflower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, open inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with leaves that are often hairy and slightly rolled. Festuca laxiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
