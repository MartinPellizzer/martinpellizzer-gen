It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, coastal habitats such as sand dunes and rocky shores, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Fimbristylis hawaiiensis is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Hawaii, making it an important component of the region's coastal ecosystems. Its delicate, flowering spikes are often seen during the wet season, contributing to the biodiversity of the islands."
