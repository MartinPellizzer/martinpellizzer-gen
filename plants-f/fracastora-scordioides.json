    "intro": "Fracastora scordioides, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its pungent odor, similar to that of garlic, and its small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can be mistaken for native species, making it difficult to control. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial that spreads through both seeds and its root system. Due to its invasive nature in North America, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
