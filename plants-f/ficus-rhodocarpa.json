    "intro": "Ficus rhodocarpa, commonly known as the red-fig or red-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its striking red-colored foliage, which contrasts with its glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, greenish fruits that ripen to a reddish hue. Ficus rhodocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions. Its leaves are also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australian communities for their purported therapeutic properties."
