    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. subtriflora, commonly known as the giant blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in dense panicles, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
