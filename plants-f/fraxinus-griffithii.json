It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by elongated, winged fruits. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in moist, temperate forests."
