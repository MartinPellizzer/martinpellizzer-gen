    "intro": "Fraxinus dippeliana, commonly known as the Dippel's ash, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fraxinus dippeliana is considered a critically endangered species."
