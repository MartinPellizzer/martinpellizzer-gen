    "intro": "Ficus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fig, is a species of fig tree native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in montane forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. It produces small, green fig fruits that are enclosed in a syconium, a unique structure that houses the tiny flowers and developing seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various animals and supporting local biodiversity."
