    "intro": "Festuca amethystina var. kummeri, commonly known as the purple false bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe. It features fine, dark green to purple-tinged leaves that form dense, mat-like growths, often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded areas."
