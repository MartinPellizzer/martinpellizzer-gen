    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental Beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in mixed forests. This subspecies is closely related to the common beech but is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and different geographic distribution."
