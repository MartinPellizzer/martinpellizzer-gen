    "intro": "Fraxinus angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus angustata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
