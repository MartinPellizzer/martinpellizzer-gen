    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. pratensis, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions. Festuca duriuscula var. pratensis is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
