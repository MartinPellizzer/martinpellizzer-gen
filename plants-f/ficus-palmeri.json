    "intro": "Ficus palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. Ficus palmeri is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system."
