    "intro": "Flueggea dracaenoides, commonly known as the dragon tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, often resembling a dragon's tail, hence its common name. The plant has a succulent, tree-like stem with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. The flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure."
