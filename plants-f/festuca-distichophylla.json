    "intro": "Festuca distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky areas."
