It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and the Pacific islands. The plant is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and its ability to climb or trail along surfaces. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, glossy, and have a waxy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans."
