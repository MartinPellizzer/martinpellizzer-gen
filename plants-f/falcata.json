    "intro": "Falcata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are berries that turn red when mature and contain seeds. Falcata is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
