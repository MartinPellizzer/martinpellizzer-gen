    "intro": "Filix bulbifera, commonly known as the bulb fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-producing structures. The plant produces bulb-like structures at the base of its fronds, which serve as a means of vegetative propagation. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Filix bulbifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
