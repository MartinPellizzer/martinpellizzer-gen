    "intro": "Festuca marginata subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth meadow fescue, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
