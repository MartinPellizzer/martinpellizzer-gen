    "intro": "Fraxinus pubescens var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are usually longer than they are wide. The leaves are typically pubescent, with a soft, downy texture on the underside, and they turn a striking yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendulous clusters in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
