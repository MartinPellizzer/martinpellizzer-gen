    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca f. viridis, commonly known as the green form of alpine fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it forms dense, mat-like growths. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in high-altitude gardens."
