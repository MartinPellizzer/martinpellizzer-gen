    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. nigricans, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, often almost black, foliage and dense, low-growing habit. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes used in landscaping and conservation efforts."
