It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and other poorly drained areas across northern regions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
