    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. caesia, commonly known as purple mountain grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
