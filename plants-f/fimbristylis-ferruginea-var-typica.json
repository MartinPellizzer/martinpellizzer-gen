    "intro": "Fimbristylis ferruginea var. typica, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a rusty-colored bloom. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often growing in dense stands along water edges. Its fibrous root system and compact growth habit make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
