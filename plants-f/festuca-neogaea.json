It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-blue foliage that is often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically forms dense mats or tussocks, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous and coastal regions. Festuca neogaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping."
