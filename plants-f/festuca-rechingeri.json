    "intro": "Festuca rechingeri, commonly known as Rechinger's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Festuca rechingeri is adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
