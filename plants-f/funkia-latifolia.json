    "intro": "Funkia latifolia, commonly known as Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, narrow stems that extend underwater. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to water gardens. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in pond landscaping. Its rhizomes can spread rapidly, making it both a useful and potentially invasive plant in certain environments."
