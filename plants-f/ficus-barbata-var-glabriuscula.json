    "intro": "Ficus barbata var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a variant of the barbata ficus species. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. This plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is often not as prominent as in other ficus species. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
