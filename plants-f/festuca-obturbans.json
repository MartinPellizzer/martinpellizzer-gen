    "intro": "Festuca obturbans, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Festuca obturbans is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects."
