    "intro": "Ficus martini var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock ficus, is a variant of the ficus genus native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and often features waxy, leathery leaves. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient choice for indoor cultivation. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits, though these are rarely seen in typical indoor settings. Its compact growth habit and tolerance to low light make it a popular ornamental plant."
