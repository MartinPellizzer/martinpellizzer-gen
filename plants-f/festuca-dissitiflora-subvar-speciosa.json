    "intro": "Festuca dissitiflora subvar. speciosa, commonly known as the showy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets arranged in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant typically produces small, two- to three-flowered spikelets with leathery, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
