It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca monantha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
