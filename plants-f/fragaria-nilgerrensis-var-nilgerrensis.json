It produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but have a more intense flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in rocky, well-drained soils. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 meters. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruits."
