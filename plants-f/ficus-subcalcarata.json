    "intro": "Ficus subcalcarata, commonly known as the scarlet fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, and glossy leaves that are typically a deep red or orange-red in color. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus subcalcarata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
