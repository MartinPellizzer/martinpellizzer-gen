    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. fraterculae, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and tufted inflorescences that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments, making it a common species in dunes and coastal meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize sandy soils. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats."
