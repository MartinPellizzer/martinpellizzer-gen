    "intro": "Froelichia floridana var. pallescens, commonly known as the Florida froelichia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, often in swampy or marshy areas with rich, acidic soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
