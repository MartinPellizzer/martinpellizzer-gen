    "intro": "Festuca polesica f. denudata, commonly known as the naked form of Polish fescue, is a variant of the grass species Festuca polesica. It is characterized by its reduced leaf sheaths and a more open growth habit compared to the typical form. This subspecies is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and pastures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
