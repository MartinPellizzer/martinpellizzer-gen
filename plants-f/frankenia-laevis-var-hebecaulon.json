    "intro": "Frankenia laevis var. hebecaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, displaying adaptations to drought and salt tolerance. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of the soil. This species is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environments."
