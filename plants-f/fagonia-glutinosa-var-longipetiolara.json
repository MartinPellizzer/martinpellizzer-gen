    "intro": "Fagonia glutinosa var. longipetiolara, commonly known as the long-petioled fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its unique morphology includes long petioles that help reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
