    "intro": "Ficus benguetensis var. leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
