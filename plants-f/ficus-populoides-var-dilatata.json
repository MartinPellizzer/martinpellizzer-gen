It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically clustered in spherical structures. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions with proper care. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both indoor and outdoor settings."
