    "intro": "Fagelia hispida, commonly known as the rough fagelia, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in terminal inflorescences. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Fagelia hispida is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil."
