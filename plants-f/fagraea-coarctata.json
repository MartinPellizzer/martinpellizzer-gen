    "intro": "Fagraea coarctata, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with elliptical leaves that have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Following flowering, it develops bright orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
