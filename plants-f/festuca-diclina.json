    "intro": "Festuca diclina, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca diclina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
