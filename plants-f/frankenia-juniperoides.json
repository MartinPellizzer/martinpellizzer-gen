    "intro": "Frankenia juniperoides, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy, coastal soils and is often found in dune environments. Frankenia juniperoides is a hardy species that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
