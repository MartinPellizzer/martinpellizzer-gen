    "intro": "Frangula grandifolia, commonly known as the largeleaf cascara, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Frangula grandifolia is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its berries are used by wildlife, and the plant has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine."
