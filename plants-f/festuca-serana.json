    "intro": "Festuca serana, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or small clumps. Festuca serana produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
