    "intro": "Festuca amethystina var. asperrima, commonly known as the asperrima fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage that reflects its name, \"amethystina.\" The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, which contributes to its hardy nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
