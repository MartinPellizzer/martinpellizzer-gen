    "intro": "Fagonia latifolia var. dubia, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
