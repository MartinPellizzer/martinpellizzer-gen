    "intro": "Ficus obtusa, commonly known as the glossy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or oval with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green or yellow when unripe and turn red or purple when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens. Ficus obtusa is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
