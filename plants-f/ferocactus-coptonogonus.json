    "intro": "Ferocactus coptonogonus, commonly known as the dense spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
