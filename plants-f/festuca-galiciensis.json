    "intro": "Festuca galiciensis, commonly known as Galician fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe, particularly in the Galicia region of Spain. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca galiciensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Its flowering spikelets are often clustered in dense, compact inflorescences, adding visual interest in late spring and early summer."
