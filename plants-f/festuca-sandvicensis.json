    "intro": "Festuca sandvicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian festuca, is a grass species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal and upland areas. Festuca sandvicensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important component of Hawaii's native flora."
