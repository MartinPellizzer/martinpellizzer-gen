    "intro": "Ferula rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that turns reddish-brown with age, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated, branched inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic properties. Ferula rubricaulis is also valued for its potential in phytochemical research due to its rich content of volatile oils and flavonoids."
