It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and slender, branching stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
