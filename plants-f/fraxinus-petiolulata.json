It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The tree has a moderate growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
