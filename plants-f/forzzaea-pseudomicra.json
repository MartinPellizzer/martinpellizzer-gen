    "intro": "Forzzaea pseudomicra, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact size and unique floral structure make it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
