    "intro": "Festuca halleri subsp. rupicaprina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca halleri subsp. rupicaprina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
