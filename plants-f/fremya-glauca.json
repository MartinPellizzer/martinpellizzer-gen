It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Fremya glauca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
