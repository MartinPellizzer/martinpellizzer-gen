    "intro": "Ferula persica, commonly known as Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fluffy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, often bitter scent, while its roots are thick and fibrous. Ferula persica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
