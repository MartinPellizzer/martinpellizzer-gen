    "intro": "Filicula montana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Filicaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly serrated. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Filicula montana has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
