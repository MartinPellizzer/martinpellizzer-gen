    "intro": "Frangula grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered cascara, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Frangula grandiflora is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
