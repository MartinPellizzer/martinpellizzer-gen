It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
