The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Festuca oryzetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
