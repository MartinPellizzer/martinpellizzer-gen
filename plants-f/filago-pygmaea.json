    "intro": "Filago pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf filago, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its small size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
