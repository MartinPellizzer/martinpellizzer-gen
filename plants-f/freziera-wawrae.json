    "intro": "Freziera wawrae, commonly known as the Wawra's frostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is notable for its unique, bell-shaped flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freziera wawrae is considered a species of conservation concern."
