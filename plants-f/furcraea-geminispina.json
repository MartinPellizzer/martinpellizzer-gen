    "intro": "Furcraea geminispina, commonly known as the twin-spined furcraea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to southern Mexico and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. It is a succulent plant, capable of storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it somewhat drought-tolerant. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
