It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that often display a distinct yellow or pale green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
