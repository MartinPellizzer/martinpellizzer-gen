    "intro": "Festuca cyllenica var. multiflora, commonly known as the mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often clustered in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Festuca cyllenica var. multiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
