    "intro": "Ficus microcarpa var. crassifolia, commonly known as the banyan fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are rarely seen due to the tree's tendency to shed them. It is known for its unique aerial roots that hang from its branches and can develop into additional trunks, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
