    "intro": "Ficus anomani, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. Ficus anomani thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage and ability to climb or trail. It is also known for its adaptability to various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
