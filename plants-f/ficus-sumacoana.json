    "intro": "Ficus sumacoana, commonly known as the Sumaco fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are encased in a fleshy, pear-shaped receptacle. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
