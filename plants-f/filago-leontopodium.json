    "intro": "Filago leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance has made it a symbol of resilience and alpine beauty. However, it is also considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
