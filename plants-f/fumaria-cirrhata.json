It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant produces delicate, nodding flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it has slender, hairy stems that help distinguish it from similar species. Its leaves are alternate and often have a distinctive crinkled or wavy appearance. Fumaria cirrhata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas."
