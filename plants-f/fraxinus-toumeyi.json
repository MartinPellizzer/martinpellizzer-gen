    "intro": "Fraxinus toumeyi, commonly known as the Touloumey ash, is a species of ash tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like China, Vietnam, and Laos. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
