    "intro": "Ficus pervia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cascading foliage and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its adaptability to various soil types. Ficus pervia is also known for its air-purifying qualities and is often used in interior landscaping."
