    "intro": "Fimbristylis littoralis var. littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh fleabane, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline or brackish environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant produces delicate, spiky inflorescences composed of tiny white or pale blue flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
