    "intro": "Fritillaria aurea, commonly known as the golden fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a strong, distinctive odor reminiscent of onions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. Fritillaria aurea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
