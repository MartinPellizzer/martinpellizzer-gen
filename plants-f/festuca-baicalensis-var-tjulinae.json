    "intro": "Festuca baicalensis var. tjulinae, commonly known as the Baikal Festuca, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
