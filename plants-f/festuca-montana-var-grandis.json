    "intro": "Festuca montana var. grandis, commonly known as tall mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
