    "intro": "Fagara diabolica, commonly known as the Devil's Backbone, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, spine-like leaf structures that give it its ominous common name. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is known for its ornamental value. Its leaves are often bright green with a glossy texture, and it produces small, fragrant white flowers. While it is not typically cultivated for its fruit, it is valued in horticulture for its dramatic foliage."
