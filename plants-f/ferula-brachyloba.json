    "intro": "Ferula brachyloba, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ferula brachyloba is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in perfumery and as a natural preservative."
