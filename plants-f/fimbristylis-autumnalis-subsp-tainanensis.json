    "intro": "Fimbristylis autumnalis subsp. tainanensis, commonly known as the Tainan sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and rice fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems."
