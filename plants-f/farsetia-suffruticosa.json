    "intro": "Farsetia suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Farsetia suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide food for local wildlife."
