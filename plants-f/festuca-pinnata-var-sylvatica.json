    "intro": "Festuca pinnata var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
