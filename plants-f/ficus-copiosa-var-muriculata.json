    "intro": "Ficus copiosa var. muriculata, commonly known as the rough-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in tiny, raised bumps, giving them a textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they ripen. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
