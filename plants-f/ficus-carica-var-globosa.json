    "intro": "Ficus carica var. globosa, commonly known as the globe fig, is a cultivar of the common fig tree characterized by its unique, round, and compact growth habit. It produces small, sweet figs that are typically harvested when they are fully ripe and have a soft, pulpy texture. The plant thrives in warm, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, rounded form and is also valued for its edible fruit. The globe fig is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for both home gardens and commercial cultivation."
