    "intro": "Festuca subulata subsp. japonica, commonly known as Japanese needlegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to East Asia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
