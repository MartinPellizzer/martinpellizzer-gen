It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pale pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and serrated, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species of ecological and botanical interest."
