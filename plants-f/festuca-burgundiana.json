    "intro": "Festuca burgundiana, commonly known as Burgundy bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca burgundiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to form dense turf."
