    "intro": "Fraxinus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its long, slender leaves that are typically 8 to 12 inches in length. The leaves are opposite, with a smooth margin and a tapering tip, and they turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
