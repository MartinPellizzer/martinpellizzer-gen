    "intro": "Fagelia bangii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its extremely hard and durable wood, which is highly valued in traditional crafts and construction. Fagelia bangii thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
