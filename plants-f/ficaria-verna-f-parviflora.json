    "intro": "Ficaria verna f. parviflora, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its early blooming habit, it is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
