    "intro": "Ficus pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. Its fruit, which is typically green when mature, contains a sweet, edible pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer. Ficus pachycarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
