    "intro": "Ficus dendroctona, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are encased in a fleshy, purple or yellowish husk. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus dendroctona is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
