    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pruinosa, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive purple to pinkish hues on the leaf blades. The plant typically thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
