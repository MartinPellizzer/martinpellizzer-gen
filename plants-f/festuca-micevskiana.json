    "intro": "Festuca micevskiana, commonly known as Mouse-ear fescue, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to wet conditions. Festuca micevskiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its stabilizing effect on soil in wetland areas."
