It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves that radiate from a central stem, resembling a waterwheel. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters with sandy or muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically narrow and elongated, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Fuirena nyasensis plays an important ecological role in its native environment by contributing to water filtration and supporting local biodiversity."
