    "intro": "Ficus cerasiformis, commonly known as the fig tree with red fruit, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, broad leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are red when ripe, making it visually striking. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus cerasiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
