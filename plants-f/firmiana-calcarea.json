    "intro": "Firmiana calcarea, commonly known as the limestone firmiana, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in limestone soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its unique adaptations make it an important species in ecological studies of calcareous environments."
