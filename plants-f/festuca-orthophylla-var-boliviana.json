    "intro": "Festuca orthophylla var. boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to blue-gray flowers. Festuca orthophylla var. boliviana is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal landscapes."
