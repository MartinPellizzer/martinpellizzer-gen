    "intro": "Ferreola ellipticifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false heather, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Ferreola ellipticifolia is often found in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas."
