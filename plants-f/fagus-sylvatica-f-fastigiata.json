    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved or columnar European beech, is a unique form of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, making it an ideal choice for formal gardens and landscapes. The leaves are smaller and more elongated compared to the typical beech, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by edible, triangular nuts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
