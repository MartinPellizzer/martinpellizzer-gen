    "intro": "Fumana hispidula var. juniperina, commonly known as the Juniper-like Heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a resemblance to juniper. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
