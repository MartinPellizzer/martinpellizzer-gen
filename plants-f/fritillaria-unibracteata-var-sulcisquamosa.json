    "intro": "Fritillaria unibracteata var. sulcisquamosa, commonly known as the Sulcisquamosa fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features elegant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting black markings. The plant produces a single, large bract that encloses the flower, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
