    "intro": "Festuca scabrella, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca scabrella is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed sites. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems."
