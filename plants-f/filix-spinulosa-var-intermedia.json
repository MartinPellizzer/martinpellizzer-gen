    "intro": "Filix spinulosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate harts-tongue fern, is a variant of the harts-tongue fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly zigzagged appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance in cultivation."
