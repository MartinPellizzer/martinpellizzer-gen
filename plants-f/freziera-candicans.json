    "intro": "Freziera candicans, commonly known as the candleplant, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, candle-like appearance, with elongated, fleshy stems that resemble candles. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Freziera candicans is noted for its ability to store water in its stems, making it relatively drought-tolerant once established."
