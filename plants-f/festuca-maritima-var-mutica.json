    "intro": "Festuca maritima var. mutica, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Festuca maritima var. mutica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
