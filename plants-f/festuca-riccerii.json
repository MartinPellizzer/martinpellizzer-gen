    "intro": "Festuca riccerii, commonly known as the Ricceri fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. The plant has slender, tufted culms and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its high-altitude habitat. Festuca riccerii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing rocky and marginal soils."
