It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically hidden within its leaves, a feature common among many ficus species. The fruit, a small fig, is edible and often consumed by local wildlife and humans alike."
