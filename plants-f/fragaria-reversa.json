    "intro": "Fragaria reversa, commonly known as the reverse strawberry, is a rare and unusual species of the strawberry genus. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with flowers that open in the reverse direction compared to typical strawberries. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to regular strawberries but have a distinct flavor profile. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its rarity and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
