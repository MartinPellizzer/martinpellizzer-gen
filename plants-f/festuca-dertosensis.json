    "intro": "Festuca dertosensis, commonly known as the Dertos grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca dertosensis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
