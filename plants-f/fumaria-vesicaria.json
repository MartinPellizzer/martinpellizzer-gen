It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its distinctive seed pods are inflated and contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
