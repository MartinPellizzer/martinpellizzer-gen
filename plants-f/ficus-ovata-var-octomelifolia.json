    "intro": "Ficus ovata var. octomelifolia, commonly known as the octomelis ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
