    "intro": "Franseria chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Franseria chenopodiifolia is often found in sandy soils and is an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat."
