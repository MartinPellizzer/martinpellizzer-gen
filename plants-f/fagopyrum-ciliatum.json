    "intro": "Fagopyrum ciliatum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces elongated, dark purple berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have finely serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Fagopyrum ciliatum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive."
