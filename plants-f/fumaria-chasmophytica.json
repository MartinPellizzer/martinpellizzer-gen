    "intro": "Fumaria chasmophytica, commonly known as the chasmophytic smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces elongated, bead-like seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices and on cliffs. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
