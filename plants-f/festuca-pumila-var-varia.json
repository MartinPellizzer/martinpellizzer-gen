    "intro": "Festuca pumila var. varia, commonly known as the variable fine fescue, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice in horticulture for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
