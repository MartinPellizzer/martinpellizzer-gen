    "intro": "Ficus glandulifera var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The hairy fig tree is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
