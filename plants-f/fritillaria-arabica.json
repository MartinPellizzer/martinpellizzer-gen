    "intro": "Fritillaria arabica, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange with contrasting black markings. The plant produces a single upright stem bearing several flowers, which bloom in spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid conditions, storing water and nutrients. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss."
