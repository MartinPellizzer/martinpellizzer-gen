    "intro": "Fraxinus attenuata, commonly known as the western ash, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures. Fraxinus attenuata is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
