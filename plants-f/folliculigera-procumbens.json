    "intro": "Folliculigera procumbens, commonly known as the creeping follicular orchid, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that form a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its often humid and shaded habitats. The fruit is a follicle, a dry, dehiscent capsule that releases seeds when mature."
