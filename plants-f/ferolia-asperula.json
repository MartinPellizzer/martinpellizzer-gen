It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, spherical berry that turns red when mature. Ferolia asperula is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
