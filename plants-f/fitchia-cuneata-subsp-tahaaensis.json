    "intro": "Fitchia cuneata subsp. tahaaensis, commonly known as Tahaa Fitchia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Tahaa in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a single, unbranched stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
