    "intro": "Festuca gypsophila, commonly known as gypsum grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, typically forming dense clumps. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those high in calcium carbonate, such as gypsum soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or silver flowers. Festuca gypsophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
