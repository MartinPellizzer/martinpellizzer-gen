    "intro": "Festuca dertonensis var. broteroi, commonly known as the Broter's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh, alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
