    "intro": "Festuca acanthophylla, commonly known as the sharp-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive sharp, pointed tip. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca acanthophylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
