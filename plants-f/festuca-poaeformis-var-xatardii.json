It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of water bodies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and seasonal interest."
