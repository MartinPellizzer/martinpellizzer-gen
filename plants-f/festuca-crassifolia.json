    "intro": "Festuca crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca crassifolia is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
