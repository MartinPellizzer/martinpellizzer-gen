    "intro": "Ficus densa, commonly known as the dense fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are usually dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green or yellow when mature. Ficus densa thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
