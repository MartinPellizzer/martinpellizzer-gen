    "intro": "Fernandezia camposii, commonly known as the Campo's fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia camposii is considered a conservation concern."
