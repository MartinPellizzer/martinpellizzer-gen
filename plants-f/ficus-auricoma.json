    "intro": "Ficus auricoma, commonly known as the ear-shaped fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are glossy and often have a waxy texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, edible fruits that are not commonly consumed by humans. Ficus auricoma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to adapt to indoor environments."
