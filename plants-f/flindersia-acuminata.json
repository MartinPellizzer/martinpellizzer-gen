    "intro": "Flindersia acuminata, commonly known as the broad-leafed flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter beneath. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Flindersia acuminata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by Indigenous communities."
