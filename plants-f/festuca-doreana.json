    "intro": "Festuca doreana, commonly known as the golden fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Festuca doreana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like growth habit. It is also considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
