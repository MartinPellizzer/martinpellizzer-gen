    "intro": "Fluminia, commonly known as the river lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pontederiaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. These plants are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of rivers and lakes. Fluminia species are often used in aquatic gardens due to their ornamental value and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. They play an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life."
