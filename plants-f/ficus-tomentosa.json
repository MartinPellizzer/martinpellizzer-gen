    "intro": "Ficus tomentosa, commonly known as the rough fig or hairy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. Ficus tomentosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and partial shade."
