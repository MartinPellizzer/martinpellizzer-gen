    "intro": "Festuca domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Festuca domingensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
