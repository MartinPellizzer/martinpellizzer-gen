    "intro": "Ficus diabolica f. minor, commonly known as the lesser devil's fig, is a rare and striking variant of the Ficus diabolica species. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. This plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fruit of Ficus diabolica f. minor is small and toxic, containing a milky latex that can cause skin irritation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest."
