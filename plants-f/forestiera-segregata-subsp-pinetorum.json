    "intro": "Forestiera segregata subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the sandbar forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal and wetland habitats."
