    "intro": "Fritillaria lusitanica f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fritillary, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a bulbous perennial that produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or open habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
