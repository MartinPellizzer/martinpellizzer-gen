    "intro": "Fragariastrum owerinianum, commonly known as the Owerinian strawberry, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, edible berries that resemble strawberries but have a distinct flavor profile. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
