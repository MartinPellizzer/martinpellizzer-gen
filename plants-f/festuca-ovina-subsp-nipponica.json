    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. nipponica, commonly known as Japanese sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
