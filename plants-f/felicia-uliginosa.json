    "intro": "Felicia uliginosa, commonly known as swamp felicia, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist or swampy habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy areas. Felicia uliginosa is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
