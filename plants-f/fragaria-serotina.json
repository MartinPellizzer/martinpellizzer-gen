It produces small, edible berries that are typically red, though they may vary in color depending on the maturity. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and a shallow root system. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of its distinctive fruit."
