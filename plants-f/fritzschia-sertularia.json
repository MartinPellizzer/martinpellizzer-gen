    "intro": "Fritzschia sertularia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a marine flowering plant found in coastal regions. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, often in areas subject to tidal influence. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline environment. Fritzschia sertularia plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small marine organisms."
