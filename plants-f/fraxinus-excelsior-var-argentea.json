This ornamental tree is native to Europe and is prized for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a prominent central vein. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds.
