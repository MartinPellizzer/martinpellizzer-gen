    "intro": "Ficus floresana, commonly known as the Floresan fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Flores in Indonesia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are enclosed in a fleshy, greenish-woody syconium. Ficus floresana thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
