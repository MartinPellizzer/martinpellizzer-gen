    "intro": "Festuca magniflora, commonly known as the showy fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, blue-green foliage that remains fresh throughout the growing season. The plant produces showy, panicle-like inflorescences with delicate, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Festuca magniflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
