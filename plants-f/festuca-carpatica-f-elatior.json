    "intro": "Festuca carpatica f. elatior, commonly known as the tall alpine fescue, is a variant of the alpine fescue species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This ornamental grass is valued for its hardiness and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance landscapes in garden settings."
