    "intro": "Fortuynia aucheri var. bungei, commonly known as Bunge's foetid agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their modest size and color, but they attract various pollinators. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
