    "intro": "Festuca pirinensis, commonly known as the Pirin fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca pirinensis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and mountain pastures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
