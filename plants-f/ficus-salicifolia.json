    "intro": "Ficus salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically 5 to 15 centimeters long. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by round, greenish fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Ficus salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
