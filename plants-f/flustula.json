    "intro": "Flustula, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale blossoms that emit a faint, sweet fragrance at night. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a critically endangered species. Botanists are particularly interested in its unique adaptations to extreme environmental conditions."
