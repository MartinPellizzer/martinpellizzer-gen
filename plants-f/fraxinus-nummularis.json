    "intro": "Fraxinus nummularis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountains of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing a rugged appearance. Fraxinus nummularis is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
