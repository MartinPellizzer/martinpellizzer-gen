It features glossy, elliptical-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and as a houseplant."
