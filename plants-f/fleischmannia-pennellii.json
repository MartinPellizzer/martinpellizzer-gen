    "intro": "Fleischmannia pennellii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though it contains mild toxins."
