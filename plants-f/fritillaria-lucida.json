    "intro": "Fritillaria lucida, commonly known as the shining fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting patterns. The plant has a short, sturdy stem that supports its clustered blooms, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of foliage. Fritillaria lucida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
