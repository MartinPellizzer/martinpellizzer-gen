    "intro": "Ficus natalensis, commonly known as the Natal fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and distinctive, fig-like fruits. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal regions and riverine forests. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while its roots system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soils. The Natal fig is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some regions."
