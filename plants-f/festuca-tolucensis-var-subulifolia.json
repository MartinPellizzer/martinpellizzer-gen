    "intro": "Festuca tolucensis var. subulifolia, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant forms dense, low-growing tussocks, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold environments it inhabits. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
