    "intro": "Fraxinus nigrescens, commonly known as the black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured and darker with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds."
