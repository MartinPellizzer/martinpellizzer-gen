    "intro": "Ficus fadyenii, commonly known as the Fadjen's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Ficus fadyenii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening in warm climates."
