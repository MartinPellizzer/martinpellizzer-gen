It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
