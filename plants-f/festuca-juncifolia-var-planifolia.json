    "intro": "Festuca juncifolia var. planifolia, commonly known as flatleaf tuftgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
