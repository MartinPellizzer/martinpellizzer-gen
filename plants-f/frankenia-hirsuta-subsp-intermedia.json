    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, glandular leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling survival in arid and saline conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
