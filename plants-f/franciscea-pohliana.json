    "intro": "Franciscea pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana francisca, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
