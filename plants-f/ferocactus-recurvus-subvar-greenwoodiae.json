    "intro": "Ferocactus recurvus subvar. greenwoodiae, commonly known as the Greenwood's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, with prominent ribs and spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
