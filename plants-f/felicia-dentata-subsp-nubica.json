    "intro": "Felicia dentata subsp. nubica, commonly known as the alpine fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
