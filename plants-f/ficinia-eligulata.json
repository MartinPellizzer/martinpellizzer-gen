    "intro": "Ficinia eligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Due to its ecological importance and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
