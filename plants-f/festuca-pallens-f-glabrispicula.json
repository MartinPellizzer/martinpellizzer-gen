    "intro": "Festuca pallens f. glabrispicula, commonly known as the glabrous-spiculate fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, flat leaves with a glabrous (hairless) surface, and its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle of spikelets. The leaves are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Festuca pallens. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental grass for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
