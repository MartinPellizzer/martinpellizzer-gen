    "intro": "Freziera chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf freziera, is a unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking yellow foliage, which is a result of its high concentration of carotenoids. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic species. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the humid air. Freziera chrysophylla is often found growing on trees or rocks, thriving in shaded, tropical environments."
