    "intro": "Flickingeria shihfuana, commonly known as the Shihfuana orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white with a deep purple or violet hue at the base, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
