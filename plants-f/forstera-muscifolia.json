    "intro": "Forstera muscifolia, commonly known as the mossy bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Forstera muscifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
