    "intro": "Fagonia armata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The fruit of Fagonia armata is a small, fleshy berry that contains seeds dispersed by animals."
