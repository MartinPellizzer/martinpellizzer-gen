    "intro": "Fimbristylis quadrangularis var. crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. The stems are usually quadrangular in cross-section, giving the plant its scientific name. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
