    "intro": "Ficus delosyce var. obtusa, commonly known as the obtuse ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically broader at the base and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits called syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to purify indoor air."
