    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria subsp. picbaueri, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in flat-topped clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, and its stems are often hairy and somewhat woody at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is closely related to other members of the Fabaceae family and is valued for its ecological and historical uses."
