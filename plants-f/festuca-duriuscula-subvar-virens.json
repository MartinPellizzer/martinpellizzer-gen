    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subvar. virens, commonly known as green mountain fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. This subvariety typically forms dense, low-growing sods, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, preferring cooler climates. Festuca duriuscula subvar. virens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
