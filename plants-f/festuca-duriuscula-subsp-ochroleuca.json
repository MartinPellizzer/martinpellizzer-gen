    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subsp. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale leaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to whitish florets, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ecological significance, it is an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
