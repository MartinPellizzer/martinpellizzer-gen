    "intro": "Fraxinus velutina var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. The smooth ash is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and tool handles."
