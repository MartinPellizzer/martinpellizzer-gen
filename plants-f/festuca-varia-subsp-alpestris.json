    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. alpestris, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Festuca varia subsp. alpestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ornamental value."
