    "intro": "Farfugium hiberniflorum, commonly known as the winter-flowering farfugium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, rosette-forming leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its unique flowering habit, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
