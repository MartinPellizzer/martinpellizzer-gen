    "intro": "Fagara thomasiana, commonly known as Thomas's fagara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and have a broad, ovate shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a white or greenish hue. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
