    "intro": "Ficus bicolor, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and yellow variegation. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 12 inches in length. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
