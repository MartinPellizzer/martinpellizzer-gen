    "intro": "Fumaria \u00d7 gagrica, commonly known as the hybrid yellow weed, is a flowering plant in the family Fumariaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
