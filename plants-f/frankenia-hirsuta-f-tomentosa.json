    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta f. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly beach morning glory, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid, sandy environments. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems."
