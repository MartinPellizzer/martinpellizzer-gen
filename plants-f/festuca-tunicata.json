    "intro": "Festuca tunicata, commonly known as tunicate fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca tunicata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
