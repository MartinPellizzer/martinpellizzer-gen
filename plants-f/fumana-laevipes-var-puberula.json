    "intro": "Fumana laevipes var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy fumana, is a variant of the fumana plant characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to certain regions of Africa, particularly in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or riverbanks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale purple. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
