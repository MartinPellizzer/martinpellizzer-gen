    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. minutiflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowering spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
