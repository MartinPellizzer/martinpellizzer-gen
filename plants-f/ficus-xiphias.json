    "intro": "Ficus xiphias, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus xiphias is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
