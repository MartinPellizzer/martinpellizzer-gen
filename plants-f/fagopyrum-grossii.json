    "intro": "Fagopyrum grossii, commonly known as the common buckwheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with smooth, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Fagopyrum grossii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
