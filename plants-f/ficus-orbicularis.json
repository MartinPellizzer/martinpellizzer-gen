    "intro": "Ficus orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are encased in a fleshy, hairy receptacle. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus orbicularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
