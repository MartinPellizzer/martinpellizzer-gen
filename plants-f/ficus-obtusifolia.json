    "intro": "Ficus obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically round and yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Ficus obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
