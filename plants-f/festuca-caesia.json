    "intro": "Festuca caesia, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and the presence of blue-gray hues in its leaf blades. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Festuca caesia produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
