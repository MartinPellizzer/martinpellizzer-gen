    "intro": "Fritillaria unibracteata var. ganziensis, commonly known as the Ganzhi fritillary, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a single, leafless bract that encloses the flower, a characteristic feature of the species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
