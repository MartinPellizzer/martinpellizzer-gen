    "intro": "Fremya elegans, commonly known as the silky gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Fremya elegans is often found in coastal and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
