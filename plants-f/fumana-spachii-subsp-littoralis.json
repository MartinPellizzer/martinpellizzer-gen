    "intro": "Fumana spachii subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal fumana, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas exposed to sea breezes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
