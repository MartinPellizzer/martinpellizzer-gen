    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. alleizettei, commonly known as the Alleizette fescue, is a perennial grass native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in temperate climates. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
