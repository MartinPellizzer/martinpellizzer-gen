    "intro": "Flourensia retinophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf flourensia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged oppositely along the stems. Flourensia retinophylla is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
