    "intro": "Ficus durbanii, commonly known as the Durban fig, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and near water sources. Ficus durbanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
