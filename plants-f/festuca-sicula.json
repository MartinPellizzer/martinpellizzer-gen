    "intro": "Festuca sicula, commonly known as Sicilian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned flowers. Festuca sicula is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean grassland ecosystems."
