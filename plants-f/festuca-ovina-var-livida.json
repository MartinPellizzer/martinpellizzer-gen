    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. livida, commonly known as blue mountain sheepgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray hue that contributes to its ornamental value. Festuca ovina var. livida is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
