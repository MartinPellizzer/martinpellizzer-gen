    "intro": "Forestiera verrucosa, commonly known as the rough forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. Its woody stems are typically covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its common name. Forestiera verrucosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and streamside habitats."
