    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. firmuloides, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its fine, dense foliage and low-growing habit. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. This variety is also valued for its ability to form dense turf and its resilience to grazing."
