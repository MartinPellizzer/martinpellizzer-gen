    "intro": "Froesiochloa boutelouoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its growth habit is low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
