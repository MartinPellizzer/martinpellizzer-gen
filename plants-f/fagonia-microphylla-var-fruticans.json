    "intro": "Fagonia microphylla var. fruticans, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its thick, fleshy stems store moisture, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This species plays an important role in stabilizing desert landscapes and providing habitat for various wildlife."
