It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is the source of its common name and has been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Ferula xylorhachis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
