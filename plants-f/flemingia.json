It is characterized by its showy, pendulous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a shower of golden droplets. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and pod fruits that contain several seeds. Flemingia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects."
