    "intro": "Filago gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's filago, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Filago gussonei is considered a species of conservation concern."
