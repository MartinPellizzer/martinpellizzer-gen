    "intro": "Ficus tesselata, commonly known as the variegated ficus or marble queen, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and light green variegation, creating a visually appealing pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus tesselata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
