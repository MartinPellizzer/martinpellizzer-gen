    "intro": "Ficinia arenicola var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in saline or brackish environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is well adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
