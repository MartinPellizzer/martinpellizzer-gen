    "intro": "Festuca boliviana, commonly known as Bolivian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Festuca boliviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
