    "intro": "Festuca formosana, commonly known as the Formosa fescue, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Festuca formosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
