    "intro": "Festuca biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear two to three spikelets, giving it its distinctive \"twin-flowered\" appearance. Festuca biflora is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
