    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. cambrica, commonly known as Welsh mountain grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in upland and alpine environments. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a ground cover. This variety is also important in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
