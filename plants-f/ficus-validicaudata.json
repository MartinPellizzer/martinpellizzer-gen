    "intro": "Ficus validicaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus validicaudata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor environments."
