    "intro": "Fatraea, commonly known as the red stem or red stem grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-colored stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Fatraea species are typically found in temperate regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plants produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species of Fatraea are cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
