It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble showers of golden droplets, hence its common name. The plants are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves seasonally, and thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Forzzaea species often have opposite, simple leaves and produce pods that contain seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
