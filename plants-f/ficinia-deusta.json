    "intro": "Ficinia deusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions outside its native range."
