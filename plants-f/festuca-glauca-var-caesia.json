    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. caesia, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive color and ability to form low-maintenance, long-lasting landscapes."
