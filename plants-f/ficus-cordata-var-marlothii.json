It features small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, pale green flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers bright, indirect light. Due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
