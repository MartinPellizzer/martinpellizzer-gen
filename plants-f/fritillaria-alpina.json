    "intro": "Fritillaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange, red, or purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a dormant bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Fritillaria alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
