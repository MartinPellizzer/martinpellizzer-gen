    "intro": "Fischeria boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian fisher's flower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Bolivia. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals that resemble small fish, hence its common name. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy stems and leaves. It produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Fischeria boliviana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
