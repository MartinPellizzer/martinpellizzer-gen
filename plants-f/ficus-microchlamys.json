    "intro": "Ficus microchlamys, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental value. Ficus microchlamys is also valued for its ability to adapt to indoor conditions with minimal care."
