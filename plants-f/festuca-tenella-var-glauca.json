    "intro": "Festuca tenella var. glauca, commonly known as blue mountain feathergrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces slender, feathery seed heads that add visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and naturalistic landscapes."
