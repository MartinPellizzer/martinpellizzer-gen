    "intro": "Floerkea uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Floerkea uliginosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native wetland environments."
