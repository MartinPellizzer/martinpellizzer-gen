    "intro": "Festuca heteroglossa, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver-green flowers, which are distinctive and ornamental. Festuca heteroglossa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground covers."
