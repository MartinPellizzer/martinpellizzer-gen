    "intro": "Festuca rigens, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often remain upright throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca rigens is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
