    "intro": "Ficus trivia, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and a smooth, often variegated trunk. The plant is a member of the Moraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its latex sap, which gives it its common name, has been used historically in the production of natural rubber. The ficus trivia is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
