    "intro": "Frankia, commonly known as the nitrogen-fixing actinomycete, is a genus of soil bacteria that forms symbiotic relationships with certain plants. These bacteria are capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen into a form that plants can use, enhancing soil fertility. Frankia is most commonly associated with members of the legume family, although it also infects some non-leguminous plants. The bacteria colonize the root nodules of host plants, where they thrive in a specialized environment. This symbiosis plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling in ecosystems, particularly in nutrient-poor soils."
