    "intro": "Flueggea major, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that produces bright yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Flueggea major is adapted to thrive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
