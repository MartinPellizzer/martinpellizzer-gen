    "intro": "Festuca morenensis, commonly known as the Morenos's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Festuca morenensis is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed alpine habitats."
