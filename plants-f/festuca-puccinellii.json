    "intro": "Festuca puccinellii, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca puccinellii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in saline and coastal areas."
