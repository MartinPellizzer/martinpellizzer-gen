It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a soft, hairy texture, especially on the underside. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native landscapes."
