    "intro": "Filix-mas \u00d7 boottii, commonly known as the hybrid male fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Filix mas* (the common male fern) and *Boottia* species. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive central rachis and branching pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the pinnae. This hybrid is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
