    "intro": "Festuca washingtonica, commonly known as Washington bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has fine, blue-green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tightly packed in tufts. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale blue to purple in color. Festuca washingtonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in wetland environments."
