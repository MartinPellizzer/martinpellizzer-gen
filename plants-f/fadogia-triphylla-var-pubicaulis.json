    "intro": "Fadogia triphylla var. pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy three-leaf fadogia, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by legume pods containing compressed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. This variant is distinguished by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
