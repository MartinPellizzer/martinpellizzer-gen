    "intro": "Festuca viridula var. howellii, commonly known as Howell's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It features fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
