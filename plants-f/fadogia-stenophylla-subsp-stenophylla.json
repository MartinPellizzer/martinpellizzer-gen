    "intro": "Fadogia stenophylla subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fadogia, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species."
