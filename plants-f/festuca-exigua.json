    "intro": "Festuca exigua, commonly known as slender fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Festuca exigua is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
