    "intro": "Fagarastrum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal fagara, is a rare shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, round berries that are typically red when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagarastrum inaequale is considered a species of conservation concern."
