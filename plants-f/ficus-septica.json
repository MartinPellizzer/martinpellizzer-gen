    "intro": "Ficus septica, commonly known as the black fig or toxic fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by inedible, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation in homes or gardens."
