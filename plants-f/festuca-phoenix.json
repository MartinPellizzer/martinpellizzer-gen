    "intro": "Festuca phoenix, commonly known as the Phoenix grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in late spring to early summer. Festuca phoenix is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
