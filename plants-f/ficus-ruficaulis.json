    "intro": "Ficus ruficaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white fuzzy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus ruficaulis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
