    "intro": "Ferula hirtella, commonly known as the hairy ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and aromatic, yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by long, slender seed pods. Ferula hirtella is known for its strong, pungent odor, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its tissues. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
