    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. ruprechtii, commonly known as Ruprecht's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that remains compact and upright throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Festuca ovina var. ruprechtii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils."
