    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. atrata, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
