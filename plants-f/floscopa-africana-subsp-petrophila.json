    "intro": "Floscopa africana subsp. petrophila, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or arid regions. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
