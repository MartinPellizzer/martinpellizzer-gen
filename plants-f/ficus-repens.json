    "intro": "Ficus repens, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cascading growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by green, round fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its ability to trail gracefully. Ficus repens is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
