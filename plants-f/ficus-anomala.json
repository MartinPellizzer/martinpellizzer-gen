    "intro": "Ficus anomala, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are typically clustered in syconia. It is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Its roots can exude a milky sap, which is used in traditional medicine and for making rubber."
