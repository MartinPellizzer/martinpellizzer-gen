    "intro": "Faramea stenomeris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved faramea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with dark green, leathery leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Faramea stenomeris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
