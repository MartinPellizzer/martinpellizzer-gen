    "intro": "Festuca serotina, commonly known as late bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Festuca serotina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
