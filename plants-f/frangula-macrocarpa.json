    "intro": "Frangula macrocarpa, commonly known as the American dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and wildlife. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Frangula macrocarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
