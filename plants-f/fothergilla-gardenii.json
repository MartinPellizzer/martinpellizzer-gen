    "intro": "Fothergilla gardenii, commonly known as rosebay witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge. Fothergilla gardenii thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens."
