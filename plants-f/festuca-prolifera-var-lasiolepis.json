    "intro": "Festuca prolifera var. lasiolepis, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the lower surface. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with blue-green to silver-gray flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
