    "intro": "Ferolia, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into oval, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Ferolia is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. Its fruit is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of edible oil."
