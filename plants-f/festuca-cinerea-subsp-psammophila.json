    "intro": "Festuca cinerea subsp. psammophila, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as steppes and coastal dunes. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences bearing slender, awned spikelets. Festuca cinerea subsp. psammophila is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
