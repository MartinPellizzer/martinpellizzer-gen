    "intro": "Ficus hartwegii var. tumacana, commonly known as the Desert Fig, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration in desert landscapes."
