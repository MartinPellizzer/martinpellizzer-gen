    "intro": "Ficus grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically large and heart-shaped, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus grandifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
