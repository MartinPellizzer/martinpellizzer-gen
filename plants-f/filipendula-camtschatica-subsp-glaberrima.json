    "intro": "Filipendula camtschatica subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple inflorescences that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
