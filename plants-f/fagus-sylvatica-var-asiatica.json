    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian European beech, is a variant of the European beech native to parts of East Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20-30 meters, featuring smooth, dark gray bark and broad, ovate leaves with doubly serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by triangular, spiky samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
