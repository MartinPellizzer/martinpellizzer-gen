    "intro": "Ferula autumnalis, commonly known as autumn ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the late summer to early autumn. The plant produces a strong aromatic resin, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Ferula autumnalis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
