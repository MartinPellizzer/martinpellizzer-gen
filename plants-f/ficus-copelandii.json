    "intro": "Ficus copelandii, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus copelandii is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
