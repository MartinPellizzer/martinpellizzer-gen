    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. aucubifolia, commonly known as the sweet birch or red birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark that exudes a vanilla-like scent when scraped. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a distinctive three-lobed shape, resembling that of aucuba. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to various landscapes."
