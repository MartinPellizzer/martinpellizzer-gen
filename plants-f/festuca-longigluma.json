    "intro": "Festuca longigluma, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Festuca longigluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil health."
