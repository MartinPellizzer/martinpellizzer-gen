    "intro": "Ficus leprieurii, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with lighter green or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically not eaten by humans. It is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus leprieurii is also known for its ability to purify indoor air and is relatively easy to care for."
