It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces numerous small, elongated pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Fumaria densiflora is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
