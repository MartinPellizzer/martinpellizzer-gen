    "intro": "Ficinia arenicola var. erecta, commonly known as the sand flat sedgeland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal and sandy environments. It typically grows in low, dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are usually green or pale brown. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in dunes or salt marshes. This variety is distinguished by its upright growth habit compared to other forms of Ficinia arenicola."
