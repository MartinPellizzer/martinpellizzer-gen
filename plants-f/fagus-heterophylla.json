    "intro": "Fagus heterophylla, commonly known as the mountain beech, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves that vary in shape along the stem. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, spiny nuts that are an important food source for wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Fagus heterophylla plays a significant role in its ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
