    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. paludicola, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and marshes. Due to its ecological importance, it is a key component of many wetland ecosystems."
