    "intro": "Ferula violacea, commonly known as the violet fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic odor due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and roots. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Ferula violacea thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant in suitable climates."
