    "intro": "Frankenia irregularis, commonly known as the irregular frangipani, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Frankenia irregularis is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
