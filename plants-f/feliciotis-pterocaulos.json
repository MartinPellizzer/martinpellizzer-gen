    "intro": "Feliciotis pterocaulos, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive, almost palmate appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
