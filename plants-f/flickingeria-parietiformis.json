    "intro": "Flickingeria parietiformis, commonly known as the wall fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense, carpet-like colonies on rocky surfaces. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, feathery appearance, with a light green to bluish-green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on limestone or sandstone walls. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
