    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. glaucodea, commonly known as silvergrass or glaucous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with a bluish-gray bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
