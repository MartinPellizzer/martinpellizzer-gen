    "intro": "Festuca woronowii subsp. argaea, commonly known as Argaean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca woronowii subsp. argaea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
