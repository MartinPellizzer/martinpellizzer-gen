    "intro": "Ficus stellaris, commonly known as the starfig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into round, fleshy fruits known as syconia. Ficus stellaris thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
