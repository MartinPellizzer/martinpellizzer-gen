    "intro": "Ferdinandusa paxii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich tone and durability, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
