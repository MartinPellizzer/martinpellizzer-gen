    "intro": "Ficus carica var. rufa, commonly known as the red fig, is a variant of the common fig tree characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-purple fruit. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, glossy texture. The fruit develops in a fig-like cluster and is often smaller and more intensely colored than the common fig. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and unique fruit characteristics."
