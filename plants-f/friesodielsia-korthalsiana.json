It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a short, creeping rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that give it a finely divided appearance. Friesodielsia korthalsiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
