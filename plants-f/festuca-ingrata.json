    "intro": "Festuca ingrata, commonly known as the bitter fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca ingrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
