    "intro": "Ficus langenburgii, commonly known as the Langenburg fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus langenburgii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant in tropical and subtropical regions."
