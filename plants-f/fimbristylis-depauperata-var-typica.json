    "intro": "Fimbristylis depauperata var. typica, commonly known as the slender flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often fibrous and help it spread vegetatively across wetland habitats. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
