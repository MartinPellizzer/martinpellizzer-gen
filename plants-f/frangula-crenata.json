    "intro": "Frangula crenata, commonly known as the rough-seeded buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, dark berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. The plant contains anthraquinones, which have been historically used in laxatives and traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
