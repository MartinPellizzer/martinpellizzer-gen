    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. abortiva, commonly known as the woodland strawberry or wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in woodland and shaded areas, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
