    "intro": "Fritillaria delphinensis f. moggridgei, commonly known as the Moggridge's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to orange-red. The plant produces a single upright stem bearing several flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, dry environments, and it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
