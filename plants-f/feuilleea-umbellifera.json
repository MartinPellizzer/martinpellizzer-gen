The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which is a common floral structure in the Apiaceae family. Feuilleea umbellifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
