It is a perennial grass that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and swales. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by water or wind. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
