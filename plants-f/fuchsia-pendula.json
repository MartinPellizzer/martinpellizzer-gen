It is characterized by its cascading clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant features slender, arching stems that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Fuchsia pendula thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and hanging baskets."
