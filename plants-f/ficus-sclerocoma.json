    "intro": "Ficus sclerocoma, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are often rough to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically enclosed in a dense, woolly husk. Ficus sclerocoma thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
