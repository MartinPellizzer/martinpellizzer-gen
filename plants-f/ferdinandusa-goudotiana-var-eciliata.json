    "intro": "Ferdinandusa goudotiana var. eciliata, commonly known as the pink-flowered evergreen, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
