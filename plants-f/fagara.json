    "intro": "Fagara, commonly known as the \"arrow poison tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae, primarily found in the tropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which are often large and deeply lobed, and their clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are used traditionally for their toxic properties, particularly in the preparation of poisons for hunting arrows. Fagara species typically thrive in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and are often found in the understory of tropical woodlands. Their ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
