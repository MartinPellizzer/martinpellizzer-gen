    "intro": "Fendlera rupicola var. tomentella, commonly known as the velvet fendlera, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage, which provides a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
