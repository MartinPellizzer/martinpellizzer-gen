    "intro": "Fagus fusca var. obsoleta, commonly known as the western black oak, is a variant of the black oak species native to western North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and acorn-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical variety. The plant is a deciduous tree that thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. It produces small, edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for their astringent properties."
