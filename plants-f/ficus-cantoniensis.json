    "intro": "Ficus cantoniensis, commonly known as the Guangdong fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to southern China, particularly Guangdong province, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically hidden within its unique, fig-like infructescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ficus cantoniensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
