    "intro": "Fagara arenaria, commonly known as the rock fagara, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky or limestone substrates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture. Fagara arenaria is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
