    "intro": "Festuca gerardii, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Blue grama is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a key component of many grassland ecosystems. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
