    "intro": "Festuca durandoi var. livida, commonly known as the bluegrass fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense, mat-like turf, making it suitable for ornamental and erosion control purposes. Festuca durandoi var. livida is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
