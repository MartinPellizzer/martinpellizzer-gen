    "intro": "Fimbristylis aestivalis var. esquarrosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This variety is distinguished by its narrow leaves and compact growth habit, making it a common component of wetland vegetation."
