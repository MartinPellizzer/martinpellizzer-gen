    "intro": "Fimbristylis paupercula, commonly known as the poor grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale flowers. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor soils, making it a pioneer species in certain ecosystems. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in wet conditions, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in maintaining soil stability and moisture retention."
