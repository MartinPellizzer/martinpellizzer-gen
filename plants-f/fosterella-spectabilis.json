    "intro": "Fosterella spectabilis, commonly known as the showy fosterella, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves form a rosette that can hold water, a feature common among bromeliads. Fosterella spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
