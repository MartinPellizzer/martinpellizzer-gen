    "intro": "Festuca changduensis, commonly known as the Changdu fescue, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its native habitat. Festuca changduensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its ecological niche and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
