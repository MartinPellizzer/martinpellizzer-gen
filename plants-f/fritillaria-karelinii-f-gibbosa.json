It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. The subspecies gibbosa is distinguished by its inflated, rounded bulbs and slightly different flower morphology compared to the typical form."
