    "intro": "Ficus elastica var. benghalensis, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its air-purifying qualities and ease of care, it is a popular houseplant."
