    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa f. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic fig, is a hemi-parasitic plant that relies on host trees for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and specialized root structures that attach to host plants. The plant produces small, fleshy figs that serve as a food source for various insects and animals. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms symbiotic relationships with its hosts. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studying parasitic plant ecology and adaptation."
