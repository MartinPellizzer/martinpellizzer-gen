    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana var. pauciflora, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
