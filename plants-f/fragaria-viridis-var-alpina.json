    "intro": "Fragaria viridis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine green strawberry, is a variant of the green strawberry plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, green berries that are typically less sweet than those of common strawberries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it produces fruits that are edible but have a more acidic flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
