    "intro": "Ficus humilis, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, round fig fruits that ripen to a yellowish color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
