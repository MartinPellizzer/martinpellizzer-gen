    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica f. aucubifolia, commonly known as the variegated green ash, is a cultivar of the green ash tree. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring white or yellow variegation on the leaves, which distinguishes it from the typical green ash. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, typical of the Fraxinus genus. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
