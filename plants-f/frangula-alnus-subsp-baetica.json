It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
