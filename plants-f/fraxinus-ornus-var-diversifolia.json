    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. diversifolia, commonly known as the diverse-fruited ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common ash. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which exhibit a range of leaf shapes and sizes, often showing variation within the same plant. The flowers are typically small and greenish-yellow, appearing in pendulous clusters, while the fruit is a small, dry capsule containing seeds. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
