    "intro": "Ficus glomerata var. chittagonga, commonly known as the Chittagong ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental planting in tropical regions."
