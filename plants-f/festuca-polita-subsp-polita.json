    "intro": "Festuca polita subsp. polita, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca polita subsp. polita is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and environmental adaptability."
