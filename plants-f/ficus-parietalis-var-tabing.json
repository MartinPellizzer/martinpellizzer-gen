    "intro": "Ficus parietalis var. tabing, commonly known as the wall ficus, is a climbing species native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
