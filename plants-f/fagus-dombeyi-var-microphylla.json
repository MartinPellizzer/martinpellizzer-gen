    "intro": "Fagus dombeyi var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf beech, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically no larger than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests and montane habitats. Due to its unique size and habitat, it is a valuable species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
