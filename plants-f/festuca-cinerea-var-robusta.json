    "intro": "Festuca cinerea var. robusta, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
