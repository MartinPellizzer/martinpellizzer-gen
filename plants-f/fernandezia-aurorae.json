    "intro": "Fernandezia aurorae, commonly known as the Aurora fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, light green fronds that resemble those of other fern genera. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Fernandezia aurorae is considered a vulnerable species."
