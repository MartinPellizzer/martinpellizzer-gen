    "intro": "Festuca rigidula, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a compact panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca rigidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
