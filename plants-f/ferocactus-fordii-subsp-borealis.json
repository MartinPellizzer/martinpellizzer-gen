It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
