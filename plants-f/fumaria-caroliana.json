    "intro": "Fumaria caroliana, commonly known as the Carolina smokeplant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Fumaria caroliana thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks."
