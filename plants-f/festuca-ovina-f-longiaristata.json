    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-leaf sheep's fescue, is a variant of the sheep's fescue species characterized by its elongated, slender leaves. This grass is typically found in temperate regions, growing in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often more densely packed and has a finer texture compared to the typical form of Festuca ovina. The plant is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
