    "intro": "Farsetia prostrata, commonly known as the creeping farsetia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, dark green, elliptical leaves that are densely arranged along its prostrate stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Farsetia prostrata thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
