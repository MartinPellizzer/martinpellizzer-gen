    "intro": "Feuilleea scalaris, commonly known as the spiral leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its spirally arranged leaves that form a tight, helical structure. This arrangement allows for efficient light capture and water drainage, adapting it to arid environments. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, which reduces water loss. Feuilleea scalaris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
