It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally waterlogged soils, often in swampy or marshy areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small flowers, which are usually green or pale in color.
