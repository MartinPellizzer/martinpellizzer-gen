    "intro": "Ficus ciliata, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that have a soft, velvety texture on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus ciliata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
