    "intro": "Flueggea xerocarpa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in hot, dry environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a spherical, spiny capsule that splits open to release its seeds when mature."
