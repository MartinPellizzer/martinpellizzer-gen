It is characterized by its massive size, often reaching heights of over 30 meters, and its broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant has dark green,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are typically large and elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits known as syconia. Ficus ingens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
