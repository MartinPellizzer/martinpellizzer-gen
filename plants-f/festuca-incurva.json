    "intro": "Festuca incurva, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, slightly curved leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowering spikes are slender and bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca incurva is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures."
