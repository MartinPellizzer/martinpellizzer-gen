    "intro": "Ficus samarensis, commonly known as the Samarensis fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Mindanao, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves and small, clustered fruits that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
