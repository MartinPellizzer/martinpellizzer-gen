    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. supina, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, soft foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. This species is often used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to form dense, uniform lawns."
