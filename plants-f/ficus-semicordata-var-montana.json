    "intro": "Ficus semicordata var. montana, commonly known as the mountain fig or variegated mountain ficus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or cream veins, which give it a striking visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its hardiness and attractive foliage."
