    "intro": "Ficus prinoides, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or climbing plant due to its vigorous growth habit. Ficus prinoides thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
