    "intro": "Ficus pantoniana var. rhytidophloea, commonly known as the wrinkled bark fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, rugged, and fissured bark that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical, three-lobed syconia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental bark and is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
