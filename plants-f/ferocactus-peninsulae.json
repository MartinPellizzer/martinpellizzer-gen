    "intro": "Ferocactus peninsulae, commonly known as the Peninsula Ferocactus, is a species of cactus native to the Baja California peninsula. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Ferocactus peninsulae is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
