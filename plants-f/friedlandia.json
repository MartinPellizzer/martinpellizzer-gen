    "intro": "Friedlandia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, often tuberous roots and showy, velvety foliage. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and yellow. Friedlandia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
