    "intro": "Fimbristylis autumnalis f. brachyactis, commonly known as the short-stemmed autumn sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the standard form of the species. The inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that bears small, three-lobed flowers. This variety is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and the margins of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
