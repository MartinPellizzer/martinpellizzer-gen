    "intro": "Festuca distichovaginata var. carazana, commonly known as the Carazan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
