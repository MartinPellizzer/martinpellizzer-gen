    "intro": "Festuca triticea, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and coarse, dark green foliage. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. Festuca triticea is widely cultivated for forage and erosion control due to its drought tolerance and hardiness. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions."
