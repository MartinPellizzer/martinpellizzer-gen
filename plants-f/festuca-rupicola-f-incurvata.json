    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. incurvata, commonly known as the bent-leaf rockgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to rocky and alpine environments. It features narrow, blue-green leaves that curve inward, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny landscapes."
