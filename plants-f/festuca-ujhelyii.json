    "intro": "Festuca ujhelyii, commonly known as the Hungarian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler conditions. Festuca ujhelyii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
