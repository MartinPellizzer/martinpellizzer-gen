    "intro": "Fraxinus pubescens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length and have a coarsely toothed margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
