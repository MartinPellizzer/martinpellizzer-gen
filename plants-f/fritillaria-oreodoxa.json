    "intro": "Fritillaria oreodoxa, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help the plant survive in harsh, arid environments. Fritillaria oreodoxa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
