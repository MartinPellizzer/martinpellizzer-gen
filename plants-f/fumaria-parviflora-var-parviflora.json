It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or green. The plant produces bladder-like structures called pseudobulbs, which are used for storing water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
