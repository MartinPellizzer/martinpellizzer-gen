It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring golden-yellow spots on the leaves that contrast with its dark green background. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically growing in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins during the spring, while its fruits are samaras that disperse in the wind. This form is prized in horticulture for its unique leaf patterns and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
