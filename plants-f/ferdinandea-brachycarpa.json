    "intro": "Ferdinandea brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, small, clustered fruiting structures. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes various ferns and their allies. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a dense, intricate venation pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Ferdinandea brachycarpa is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
