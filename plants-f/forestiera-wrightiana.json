    "intro": "Forestiera wrightiana, commonly known as Wright's forestiera, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. Its small, elliptical leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
