It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca regelii is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
