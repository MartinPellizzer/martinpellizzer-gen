    "intro": "Fimbristylis metzii, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Fimbristylis metzii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas."
