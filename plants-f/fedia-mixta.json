    "intro": "Fedia mixta, commonly known as the mixed fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Fedia mixta has small, clustered spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
