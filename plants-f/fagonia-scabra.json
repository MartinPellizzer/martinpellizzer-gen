    "intro": "Fagonia scabra, commonly known as the rough fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Fagonia scabra is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
