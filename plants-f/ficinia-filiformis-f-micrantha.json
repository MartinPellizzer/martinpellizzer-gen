    "intro": "Ficinia filiformis f. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf fig sedge, is a variant of the narrowleaf fig sedge, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. It is a perennial plant native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly found in wetland and swampy environments. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic or marshy habitats. The foliage is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
