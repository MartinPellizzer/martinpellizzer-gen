    "intro": "Ferocactus emoryi var. rectispinus, commonly known as the Emory prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems that grow in a spherical or cylindrical shape, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The variety rectispinus is distinguished by its straight, sharp spines and is well adapted to desert conditions."
