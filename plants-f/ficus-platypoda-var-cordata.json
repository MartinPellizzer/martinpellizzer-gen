    "intro": "Ficus platypoda var. cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically not edible for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
