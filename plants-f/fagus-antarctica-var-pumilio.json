    "intro": "Fagus antarctica var. pumilio, commonly known as the Antarctic beech, is a rare and cold-hardy variant of the beech tree. It is native to the subantarctic regions of New Zealand, specifically the Bounty Islands. This plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The tree grows in a compact form, adapting to the harsh, windy conditions of its environment. It plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for endemic wildlife."
