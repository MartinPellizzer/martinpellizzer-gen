    "intro": "Feuilleea umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to the shaded understories of tropical forests. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in moist, well-drained soil. Feuilleea umbrosa thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light to flourish."
