It features a cylindrical stem with thick, ribbed segments that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its spines are typically yellow to reddish in color, providing both protection and a distinctive appearance. This variety is known for its slow growth and ability to withstand extreme temperatures."
