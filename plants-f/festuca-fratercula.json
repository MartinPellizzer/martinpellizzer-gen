    "intro": "Festuca fratercula, commonly known as the rock grass or alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca fratercula thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its resilience to cold and drought makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
