    "intro": "Festuca rupicola, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant typically grows in elevations ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 feet, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to stabilize slopes and prevent erosion. Festuca rupicola is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
