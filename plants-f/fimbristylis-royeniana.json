    "intro": "Fimbristylis royeniana, commonly known as the royal sedge, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, often found in wetland or swampy habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. Fimbristylis royeniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
