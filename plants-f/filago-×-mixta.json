    "intro": "Filago \u00d7 mixta, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Filago acaulis and Filago umbrosa, characterized by its yellow composite flowers and pinnately lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It produces a distinctive elongated, hollow stem and has a fibrous root system. Due to its hybrid nature, Filago \u00d7 mixta exhibits variability in morphology and is often used in ecological studies to understand hybridization in plants."
