    "intro": "Ferula ammonifera, commonly known as the ammoniac plant, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences composed of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been historically used for its medicinal and aromatic properties. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Ferula ammonifera thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
