It is a shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
