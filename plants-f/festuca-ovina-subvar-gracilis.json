    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. gracilis, commonly known as slender sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland, grasslands, and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
