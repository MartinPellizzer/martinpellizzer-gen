    "intro": "Ficus cordatula, commonly known as the heart-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and dark green. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fig fruits. Ficus cordatula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
