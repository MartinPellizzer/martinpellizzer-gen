    "intro": "Fagus valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian oak, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate rainforests of southern South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its distinctive, rounded, grayish-brown bark. The tree produces small, cup-shaped acorns that are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in montane forests. Fagus valdiviana plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
