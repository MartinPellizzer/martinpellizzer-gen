    "intro": "Fraxinus parvifolia f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf green ash, is a compact, slow-growing variant of the green ash tree. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and suitability for smaller garden spaces."
