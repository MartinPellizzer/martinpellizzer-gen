    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. silvulicola, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more tart than those of common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
