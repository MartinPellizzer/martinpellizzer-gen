    "intro": "Ficinia costata, commonly known as the coastal flatworm, is a unique plant species found in specific coastal environments. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its specialized habitat, Ficinia costata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
