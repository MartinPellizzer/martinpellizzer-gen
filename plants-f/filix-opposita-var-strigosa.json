    "intro": "Filix opposita var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a variant of the common brake fern. It is characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The hairy texture of its leaves is an adaptation that may help reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
