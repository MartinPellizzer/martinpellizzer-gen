    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes subsp. lecontei, commonly known as the Leconte's barrel cactus, is a distinctive member of the Cactaceae family native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stems. Its spines are short and dense, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This subspecies is well-adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
