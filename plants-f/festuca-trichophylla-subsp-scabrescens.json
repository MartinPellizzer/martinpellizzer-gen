    "intro": "Festuca trichophylla subsp. scabrescens, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Festuca trichophylla subsp. scabrescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
