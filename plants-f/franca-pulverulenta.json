    "intro": "Franca pulverulenta, commonly known as the dusty frangipani, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Franca pulverulenta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and pleasant aroma."
