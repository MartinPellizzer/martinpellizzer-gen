    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea f. obtusiflora, commonly known as soft fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense foliage. It is a cool-season perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with dull, rounded spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. It is also used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
