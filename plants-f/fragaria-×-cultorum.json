It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its small, aggregate fruits that resemble strawberries. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It produces white flowers with five petals and is known for its trailing growth habit. The fruit, though smaller than the cultivated strawberry, is often used in culinary applications and has a tart, aromatic flavor."
