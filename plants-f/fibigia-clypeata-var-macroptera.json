    "intro": "Fibigia clypeata var. macroptera, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The fronds are composed of multiple layers of tightly packed, waxy scales that provide structural support and moisture retention."
