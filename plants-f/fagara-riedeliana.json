    "intro": "Fagara riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's fagara, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are glossy and lance-shaped, while its fruit is a small, dark berry that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagara riedeliana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
