    "intro": "Ferula lutea, commonly known as yellow cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. Ferula lutea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic leaves and flowers have been used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
