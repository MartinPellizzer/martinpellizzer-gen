    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian ash, is a variant of the narrow-leaf ash native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
