    "intro": "Ficus mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, though these are typically not consumed by humans. Ficus mollis thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. Its adaptability and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and tropical landscapes."
