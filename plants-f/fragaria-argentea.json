    "intro": "Fragaria argentea, commonly known as the silver strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers and edible, small, yellowish berries that are often described as having a sweet and tangy flavor. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a slightly hairy surface, and it has a low-growing habit with runners that can spread across the ground. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
