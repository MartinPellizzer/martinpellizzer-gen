    "intro": "Ficus vogelii var. pubicarpa, commonly known as the wooly fig, is a species native to parts of Africa, particularly Tanzania and Kenya. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically covered in a fuzzy coating. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The wooly fig is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
