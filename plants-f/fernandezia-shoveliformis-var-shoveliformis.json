    "intro": "Fernandezia shoveliformis var. shoveliformis, commonly known as the shovel-shaped fern, is a distinctive fern species characterized by its unique, broad, and shovel-like fronds. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's reproductive structures are clustered at the base of the fronds, forming compact, spore-producing clusters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing habitat loss and environmental degradation."
