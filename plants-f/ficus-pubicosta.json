    "intro": "Ficus pubicosta, commonly known as the pubicosta fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically pubescent, or covered in fine hairs, on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Ficus pubicosta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
