    "intro": "Festuca tectoria var. mutica, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and silvery-green foliage that forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ground cover and erosion control. The inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers."
