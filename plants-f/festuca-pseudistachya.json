    "intro": "Festuca pseudistachya, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Festuca pseudistachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
