    "intro": "Fugosia retusa, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Fugosia retusa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
