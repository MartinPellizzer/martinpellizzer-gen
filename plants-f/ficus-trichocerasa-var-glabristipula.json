    "intro": "Ficus trichocerasa var. glabristipula, commonly known as the smooth-stipuled fig, is a species of fig tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaf stipules, which distinguish it from other ficus varieties. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical in shape, and have a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and attract various wildlife, contributing to its ecological significance."
