It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit, making it suitable for small spaces or as a hedge. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a pale yellowish-green color. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal.
