    "intro": "Ficus kajewskii, commonly known as the Kajewskii fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically round and have a sweet, soft texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus kajewskii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
