    "intro": "Fimbristylis exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and roadside ditches. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often pale green or brownish. It is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils. Fimbristylis exigua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
