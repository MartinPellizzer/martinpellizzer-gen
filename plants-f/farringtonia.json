    "intro": "Farringtonia, commonly known as the white cedar, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They typically grow as trees or shrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Farringtonia species are valued for their hard, durable wood and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
