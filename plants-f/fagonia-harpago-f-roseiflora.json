    "intro": "Fagonia harpago f. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered fagonia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often with a pink or rose-colored hue, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Fagonia harpago f. roseiflora is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
