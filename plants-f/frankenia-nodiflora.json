    "intro": "Frankenia nodiflora, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Frankenia nodiflora is well adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
