    "intro": "Fimbristylis koreensis, commonly known as the Korean hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is native to East Asia, particularly South Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. Fimbristylis koreensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
