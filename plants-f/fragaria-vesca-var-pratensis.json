It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white with pinkish hues, which bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets and develops red, juicy berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in forest understories and gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, sweet flavor in its berries."
