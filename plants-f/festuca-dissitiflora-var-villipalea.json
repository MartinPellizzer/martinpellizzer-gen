    "intro": "Festuca dissitiflora var. villipalea, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. It is a low-growing plant, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
