It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Fagraea ligustrina is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
