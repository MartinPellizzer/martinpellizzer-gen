    "intro": "Frailea gracillima subsp. alacriportana, commonly known as the Cape Verde fairy shrimp cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Cape Verde Islands. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a single, often branched spination, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the rainy season. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. It has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
