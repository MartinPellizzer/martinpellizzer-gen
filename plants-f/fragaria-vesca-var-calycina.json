    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. calycina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than common garden strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and culinary appeal, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
