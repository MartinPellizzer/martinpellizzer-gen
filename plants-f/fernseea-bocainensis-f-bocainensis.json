    "intro": "Fernseea bocainensis f. bocainensis, commonly known as the Bocainense fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
