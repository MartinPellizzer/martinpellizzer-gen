    "intro": "Ficus trigona, commonly known as the shield leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often shield-shaped, providing a unique visual appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically covered in a sticky, whitish bloom. Ficus trigona thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
