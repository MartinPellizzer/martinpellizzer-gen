    "intro": "Fritillaria affinis, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with distinctive black spots. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in arid environments, storing water and nutrients for extended periods. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Fritillaria affinis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
