    "intro": "Fascicularia litoralis, commonly known as the sea foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, violet or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Fascicularia litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
