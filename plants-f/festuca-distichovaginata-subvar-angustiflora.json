    "intro": "Festuca distichovaginata subvar. angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a blue-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
