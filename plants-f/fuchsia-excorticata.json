The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its bark is thin and peeling, giving it its scientific name \"excoricata.\" It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display. The coral tree is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
