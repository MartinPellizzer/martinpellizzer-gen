    "intro": "Fragaria crantzii, commonly known as the creeping strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are followed by edible, red berries similar to strawberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Fragaria crantzii is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides food for wildlife."
