It features small, fleshy leaves with translucent windows that allow light to penetrate to the photosynthetic tissues beneath. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique leaf structure and low maintenance make it a popular choice among cactus and succulent enthusiasts."
