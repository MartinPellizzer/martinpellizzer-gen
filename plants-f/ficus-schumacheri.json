    "intro": "Ficus schumacheri, commonly known as the Schumacher's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus schumacheri is also popular as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions with proper care."
