    "intro": "Festuca broteri, commonly known as the dwarf blue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Festuca broteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
