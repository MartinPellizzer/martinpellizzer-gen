    "intro": "Flickingeria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
