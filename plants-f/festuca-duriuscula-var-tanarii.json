    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. tanarii, commonly known as the Tanarii fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with small, two-ranked flowers that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens and restoration projects."
