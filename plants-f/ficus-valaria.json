    "intro": "Ficus valaria, commonly known as the Variegated Ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often feature white or cream-colored veins and margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fruits called syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for indoors. Ficus valaria is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
