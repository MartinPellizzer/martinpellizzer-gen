    "intro": "Forneum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost spectral in sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb moisture from the thin, cold air. Due to its extreme habitat requirements, Forneum is considered endangered and is rarely found in cultivation."
