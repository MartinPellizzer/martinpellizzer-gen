    "intro": "Froelichia lanata var. procera, commonly known as the tall woolly holly, is a variant of the woolly holly species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and branches, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with thick, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces red berries that are a food source for various birds. The plant is well adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands."
