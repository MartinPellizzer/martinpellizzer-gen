    "intro": "Ferocactus hastifer, commonly known as the horse collars cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. Ferocactus hastifer is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and appearance make it a striking addition to desert landscapes."
