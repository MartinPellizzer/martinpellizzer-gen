It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent habit. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat.
