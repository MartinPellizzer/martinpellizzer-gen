    "intro": "Frankenia setosa, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in sandy soils. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained environments, making it a common sight along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs that provide protection against wind and salt spray. Frankenia setosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
