    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. marginata, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude grasslands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers. Festuca ovina subsp. marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
