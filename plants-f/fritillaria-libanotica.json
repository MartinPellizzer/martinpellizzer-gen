    "intro": "Fritillaria libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon fritillary, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbous roots store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. Fritillaria libanotica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
