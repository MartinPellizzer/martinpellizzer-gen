    "intro": "Fragaria virginiana var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are less showy than the common strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, though not as widely cultivated as the common strawberry, is edible and has a delicate flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
