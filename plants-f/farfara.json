    "intro": "Farfara, commonly known as coltsfoot, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils. Farfara has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory benefits. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish itself in various habitats."
