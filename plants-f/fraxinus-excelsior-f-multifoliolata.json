    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. multifoliolata, commonly known as the European ash with multiple leaflets, is a variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring multiple leaflets that give it a more complex appearance compared to the typical ash. The leaves are usually opposite, with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a range of garden environments."
