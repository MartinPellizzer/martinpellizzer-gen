    "intro": "Ficus rubra var. sechellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles fig, is a unique variant of the common fig tree. It is native to the Seychelles archipelago and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife and sometimes by humans. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
