    "intro": "Festuca microstachys, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with fine, blue-green foliage that is highly ornamental. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in native plant gardens and erosion control."
