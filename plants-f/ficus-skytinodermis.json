    "intro": "Ficus skytinodermis, commonly known as the skytree fig, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to high light conditions and humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. Its trunk is often covered in a thick, bark-like layer that provides protection against environmental stress. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
