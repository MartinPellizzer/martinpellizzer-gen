    "intro": "Festuca juncea, commonly known as Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Timothy grass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. It is also valued for its use in forage and as a component in turfgrass mixtures."
