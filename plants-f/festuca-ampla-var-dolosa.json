    "intro": "Festuca ampla var. dolosa, commonly known as the Dolosa feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that turns bluish-green in the summer. The plant produces dense clusters of narrow, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ecological benefits."
