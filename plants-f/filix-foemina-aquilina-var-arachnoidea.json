It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like fronds that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across the ground. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest floors. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a velvety texture that adds to its ornamental value."
