    "intro": "Fouquieria fasciculata, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive red, lantern-like fruits. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Fouquieria fasciculata plays a role in providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
