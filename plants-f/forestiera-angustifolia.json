It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest understories. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. Its fragrant white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The shrub is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
