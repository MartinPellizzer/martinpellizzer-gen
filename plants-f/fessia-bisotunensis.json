    "intro": "Fessia bisotunensis, commonly known as the Bisotun fessia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Iran. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its limited distribution and unique habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Due to its rarity, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection to ensure its survival."
