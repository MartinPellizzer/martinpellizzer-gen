    "intro": "Fagonia bruguieri var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found growing on rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
