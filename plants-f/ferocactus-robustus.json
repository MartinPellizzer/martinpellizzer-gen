    "intro": "Ferocactus robustus, commonly known as the thick-armed cactus, is a species native to the deserts of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Ferocactus robustus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
