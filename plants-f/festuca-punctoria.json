    "intro": "Festuca punctoria, commonly known as dotted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, pale blue or whitish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca punctoria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
