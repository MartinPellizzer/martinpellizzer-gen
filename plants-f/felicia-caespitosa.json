    "intro": "Felicia caespitosa, commonly known as the yellow daisy or golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often with a compact, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Felicia caespitosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
