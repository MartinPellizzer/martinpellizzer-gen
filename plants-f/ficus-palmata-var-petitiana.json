    "intro": "Ficus palmata var. petitiana, commonly known as the Petitiana fig tree, is a rare and ornamental species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, palm-like foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves with a glossy surface. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its compact form and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
