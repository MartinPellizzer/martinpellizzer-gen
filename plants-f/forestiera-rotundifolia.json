It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically rounded at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and seasonal blooms."
