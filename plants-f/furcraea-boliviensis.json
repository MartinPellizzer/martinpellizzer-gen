    "intro": "Furcraea boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian sword plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to South America. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. Furcraea boliviensis is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
