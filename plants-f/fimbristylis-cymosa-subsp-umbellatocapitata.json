    "intro": "Fimbristylis cymosa subsp. umbellatocapitata, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a sedge species characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, thriving in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system, which aids in its propagation and survival in waterlogged soils. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
