    "intro": "Ficus imberbis var. basiacuta, commonly known as the smooth fig or the basiacuta fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and lack the prominent veins found in many other ficus species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
