    "intro": "Flagellaria indica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf flagellaria, is a tropical climbing plant native to regions of Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems with small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
