    "intro": "Ficus motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. This plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. Ficus motuoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
