It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant typically grows near water bodies, such as rivers and ponds, and thrives in humid environments. It has a shallow root system that helps it anchor in moist soil or aquatic substrates. Ficus aquatica is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various conditions."
