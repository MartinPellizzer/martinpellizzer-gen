    "intro": "Filaginella tranzschelii, commonly known as the Transkei lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found on rocks and soil surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Filaginella tranzschelii plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
