    "intro": "Ferraria pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ferraria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink star-shaped blooms during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, strap-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ferraria pusilla is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
