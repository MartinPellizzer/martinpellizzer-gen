    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth and ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
