It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. Frankenia cymbifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh coastal conditions."
