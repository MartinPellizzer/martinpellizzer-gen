    "intro": "Frankenia annua, commonly known as the annual frangipani, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Frankenia annua is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines."
