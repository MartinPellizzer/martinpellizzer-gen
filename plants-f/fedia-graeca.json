    "intro": "Fedia graeca, commonly known as the Greek fedia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fedia graeca is considered a vulnerable species."
