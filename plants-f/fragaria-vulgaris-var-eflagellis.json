    "intro": "Fragaria vulgaris var. eflagellis, commonly known as the slender strawberry, is a variant of the common strawberry that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its elongated, thin leaves compared to the typical broad, heart-shaped foliage of standard strawberries. The plant produces small, often pale red fruits that are less flavorful than those of the common variety. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a less common cultivar in horticultural practice."
