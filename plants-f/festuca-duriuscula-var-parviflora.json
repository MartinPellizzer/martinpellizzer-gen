    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
