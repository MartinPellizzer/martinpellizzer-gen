The leaves are typically larger than those of standard figs and feature a unique speckled or dotted appearance, giving it its common name. This variety is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities rather than its fruit production. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. The plant is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a decorative tree."
