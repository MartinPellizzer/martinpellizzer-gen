    "intro": "Ficus vermifuga, commonly known as the worm-eating fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and small, clustered fig fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in forests. Its leaves contain compounds that have been traditionally used for their medicinal properties. The fruit, while edible, is typically consumed by specific wildlife rather than humans."
