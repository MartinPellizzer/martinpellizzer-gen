    "intro": "Fiebrigiella, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Fiebrigiella has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
