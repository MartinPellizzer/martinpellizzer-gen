    "intro": "Festuca unilateralis var. subpaniculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
