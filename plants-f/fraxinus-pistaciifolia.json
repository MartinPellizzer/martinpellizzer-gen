    "intro": "Fraxinus pistaciifolia, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive glossy green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It is known for its slow growth and exceptional durability, making it a valuable species in arid and semi-arid environments. The wood is dense and strong, historically used for construction and tool-making."
