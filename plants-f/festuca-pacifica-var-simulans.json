    "intro": "Festuca pacifica var. simulans, commonly known as the Pacific bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along coastal areas and in shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
