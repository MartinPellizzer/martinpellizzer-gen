    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, rocky environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
