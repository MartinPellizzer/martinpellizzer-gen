    "intro": "Forestiera reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. Its adaptability to a variety of soil types makes it a hardy plant suitable for landscaping in woodland areas. The shrub is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
