    "intro": "Felicia paralia, commonly known as sea daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Felicia paralia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and xeriscaping."
