    "intro": "Furcraea longaeva, commonly known as the long-lived furcraea, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its thick, fibrous leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear at the top of the stem, followed by dark blue, spherical berries. Due to its slow growth and longevity, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
