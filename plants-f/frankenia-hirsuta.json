    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent appearance, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in dune environments and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Frankenia hirsuta is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy coastal plant."
