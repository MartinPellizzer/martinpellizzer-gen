    "intro": "Filaginella lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly filaginella, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its densely hairy, or pilose, leaf surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, compact growth form allows it to thrive in harsh conditions where other plants may not. Filaginella lasiocarpa is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
