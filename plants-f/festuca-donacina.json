    "intro": "Festuca donacina, commonly known as the reed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca donacina is adapted to moist environments and is often found in areas with poor drainage. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
