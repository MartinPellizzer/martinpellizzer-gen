    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. normale, commonly known as the white ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its compound leaves with 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its bark is gray and smooth when young, becoming furrowed with age. The wood is strong and flexible, historically valued for making baseball bats and tool handles."
