    "intro": "Festuca vasconcensis, commonly known as the Valais bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of southwestern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca vasconcensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
