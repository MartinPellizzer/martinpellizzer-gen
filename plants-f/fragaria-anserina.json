    "intro": "Fragaria anserina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible, red, berry-like fruits that are often smaller and less sweet than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
