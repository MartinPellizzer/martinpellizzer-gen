    "intro": "Festuca cernua, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Festuca cernua is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
