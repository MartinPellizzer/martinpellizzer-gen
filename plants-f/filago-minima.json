    "intro": "Filago minima, commonly known as the dwarf filago, is a small flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its size and habitat, it is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and gardeners specializing in succulents and alpine plants."
