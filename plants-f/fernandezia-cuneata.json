    "intro": "Fernandezia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. Fernandezia cuneata is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
