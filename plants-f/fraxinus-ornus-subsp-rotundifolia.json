    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus subsp. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its ovate to round leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
