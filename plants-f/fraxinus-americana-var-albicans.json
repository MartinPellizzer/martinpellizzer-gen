    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. albicans, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with 9 to 15 elliptical leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The white ash is valued for its strong, flexible wood, which has been used historically for tool handles and sports equipment."
