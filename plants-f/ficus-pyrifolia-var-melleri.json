    "intro": "Ficus pyrifolia var. melleri, commonly known as the Meller's fig, is a rare and specialized variant of the fig tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a waxy surface and a distinctive, almost triangular shape. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
