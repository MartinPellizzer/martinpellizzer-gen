    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. durissima, commonly known as tough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it withstand drought and grazing. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
