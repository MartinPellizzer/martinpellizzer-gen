    "intro": "Filetia brookeae, commonly known as the Brooke's filetia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
