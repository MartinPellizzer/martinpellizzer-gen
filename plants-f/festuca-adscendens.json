It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca adscendens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
