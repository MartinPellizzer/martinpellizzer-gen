    "intro": "Ficus eugenioides, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus eugenioides is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its role in traditional medicine."
