    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. pseudovivipara, commonly known as red fescue var. pseudovivipara, is a variant of red fescue characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. One of its distinguishing botanical traits is the presence of pseudoviviparous structures, which are seed-like formations that appear on the flower spikes. This form is often found in alpine and rocky habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
