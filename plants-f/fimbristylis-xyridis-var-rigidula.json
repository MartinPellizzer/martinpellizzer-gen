    "intro": "Fimbristylis xyridis var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often reddish in color. Its flowering stems are usually erect and can reach heights of up to 50 centimeters. The species is characterized by its rigid, stiff leaves and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
