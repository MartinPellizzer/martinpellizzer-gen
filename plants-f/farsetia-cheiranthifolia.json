    "intro": "Farsetia cheiranthifolia, commonly known as the rock wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. Farsetia cheiranthifolia is often found in alpine meadows and on rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
