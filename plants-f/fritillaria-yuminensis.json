    "intro": "Fritillaria yuminensis, commonly known as the Yumin fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting black markings. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it a suitable candidate for alpine gardens. Its bulbs are relatively small and require a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
