    "intro": "Fragaria moschata subsp. jenisseensis, commonly known as the Siberian strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into edible berries with a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant has a low-growing habit with runners and is adapted to thrive in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the fruits are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use in traditional cuisines."
