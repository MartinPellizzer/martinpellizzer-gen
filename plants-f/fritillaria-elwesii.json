It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with dark markings, resembling a fritillary butterfly. The plant has a tall, leafless stem that bears a single, upright flower cluster. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments, and it thrives in well-drained soils.
