    "intro": "Fritillaria glabra var. shanxiensis, commonly known as the Shanxi fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Shanxi Province in China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a thick, fleshy bulb that serves as its storage organ. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
