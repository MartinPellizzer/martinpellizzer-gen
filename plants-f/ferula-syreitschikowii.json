    "intro": "Ferula syreitschikowii, commonly known as the Kashmir ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula syreitschikowii is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, arid conditions with well-drained soil."
