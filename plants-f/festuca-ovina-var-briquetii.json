    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. briquetii, commonly known as the Briquet's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it contributes to the ecological stability of these harsh habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
