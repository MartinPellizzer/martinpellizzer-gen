    "intro": "Flemingia lineata var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky flemingia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, tropical environments. Its stems and leaves are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. This trait may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pests."
