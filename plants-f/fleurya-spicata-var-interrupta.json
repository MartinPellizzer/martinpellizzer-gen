It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
