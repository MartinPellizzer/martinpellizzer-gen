    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. borealis, commonly known as Arctic bluegrass, is a cold-tolerant grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, low-nutrient environments. This variant is often found in tundra and rocky habitats where it forms dense mats to prevent soil erosion. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish colonies in nutrient-poor soils. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing fragile ecosystems in polar and high-altitude regions."
