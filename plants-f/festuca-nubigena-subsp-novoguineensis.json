    "intro": "Festuca nubigena subsp. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brownish in color, with small, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
