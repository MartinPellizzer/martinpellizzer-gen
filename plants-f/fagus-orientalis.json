    "intro": "Fagus orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental beech, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. The Oriental beech is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
