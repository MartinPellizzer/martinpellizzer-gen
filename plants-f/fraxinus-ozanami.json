    "intro": "Fraxinus ozanami, commonly known as the Japanese ash, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and parts of Korea. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth with a pale grayish hue, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Fraxinus ozanami is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional Japanese gardens."
