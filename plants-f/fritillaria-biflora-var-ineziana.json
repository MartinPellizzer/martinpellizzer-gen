    "intro": "Fritillaria biflora var. ineziana, commonly known as the Ineziana fritillary, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces large, rounded bulbs that store energy for the next growing season. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
