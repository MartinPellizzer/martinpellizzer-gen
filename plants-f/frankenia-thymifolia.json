    "intro": "Frankenia thymifolia, commonly known as coastal bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Frankenia thymifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
