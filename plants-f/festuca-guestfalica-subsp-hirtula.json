It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
