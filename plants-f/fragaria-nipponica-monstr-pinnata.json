    "intro": "Fragaria nipponica monstr. pinnata, commonly known as the Japanese woodland strawberry, is a rare and ornamental variant of the strawberry plant. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its fruits are similar to regular strawberries but are often smaller and less common in cultivation. This species is native to Japan and is valued for its unique foliage and potential ornamental use in gardens."
