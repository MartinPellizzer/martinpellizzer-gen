    "intro": "Ficus acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that have a pointed tip, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus acutifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
