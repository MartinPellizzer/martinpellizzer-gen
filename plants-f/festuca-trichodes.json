    "intro": "Festuca trichodes, commonly known as the trichodes fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Festuca trichodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate appearance. It is also a host plant for certain insect species, contributing to local biodiversity."
