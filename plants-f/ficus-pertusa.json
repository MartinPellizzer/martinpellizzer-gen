    "intro": "Ficus pertusa, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive weeping pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive indoors. However, it requires careful watering and bright, indirect light to maintain its health and aesthetic appeal."
