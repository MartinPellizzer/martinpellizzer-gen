    "intro": "Filix pumila, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Asia, Europe, and North America. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and has a rhizomatous growth habit. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Filix pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a houseplant."
