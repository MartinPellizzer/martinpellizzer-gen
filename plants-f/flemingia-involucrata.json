    "intro": "Flemingia involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or flemingia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Flemingia involucrata is native to Southeast Asia and is commonly found in moist, shaded environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
