    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana var. pubescens, commonly known as the silver ash, is a variant of the sweetgum tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by spherical, spiky fruit clusters that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
