    "intro": "Festuca bromoides var. tenella, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and landscape borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
