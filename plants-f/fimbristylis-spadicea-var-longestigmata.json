    "intro": "Fimbristylis spadicea var. longestigmata, commonly known as the long-beaked sedge, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The variety longestigmata is distinguished by its elongated bract at the base of the inflorescence, which sets it apart from other varieties of Fimbristylis."
