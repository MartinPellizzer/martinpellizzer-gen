    "intro": "Frenela columellaris, commonly known as the columnar fern, is a unique species characterized by its upright, tree-like growth habit. It features a single, unbranched stem that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, supporting a crown of feather-like fronds. The fronds are pinnate, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often glossy and dark green. This plant is native to specific regions in South America and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
