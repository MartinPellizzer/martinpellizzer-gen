It is a member of the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its large, feathery leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, swampy environments, making it a common sight in mangrove ecosystems."
