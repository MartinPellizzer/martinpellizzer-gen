It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, spherical nuts enclosed in a cupule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of subantarctic regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the subantarctic ecosystem."
