    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa, commonly known as the Sierra satinash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2 to 4 inches long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that is dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
