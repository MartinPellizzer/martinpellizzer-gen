    "intro": "Festuca humifusa, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth that spreads via rhizomes, creating a carpet of fine, dark green foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Festuca humifusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
