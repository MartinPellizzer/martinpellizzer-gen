    "intro": "Fragaria pumila, commonly known as the woodland strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, edible berries that are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves and runners that help it spread across forest floors. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to compete with other ground-cover plants in dense ecosystems."
