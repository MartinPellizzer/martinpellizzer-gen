    "intro": "Festuca cataonica, commonly known as the Cataonic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca cataonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
