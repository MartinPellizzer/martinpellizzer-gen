    "intro": "Festuca deserti subsp. duriaei, commonly known as desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in desert scrub and sandy soils across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico."
