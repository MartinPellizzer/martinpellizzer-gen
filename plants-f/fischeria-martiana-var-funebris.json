    "intro": "Fischeria martiana var. funebris, commonly known as the funeral fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features elegant, arching fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length, with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique, cascading foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
