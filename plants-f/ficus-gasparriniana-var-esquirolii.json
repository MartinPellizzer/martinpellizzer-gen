    "intro": "Ficus gasparriniana var. esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's fig, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Ficus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, specifically in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range."
