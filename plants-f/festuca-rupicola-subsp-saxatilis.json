    "intro": "Festuca rupicola subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, awned spikelets. Festuca rupicola subsp. saxatilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
