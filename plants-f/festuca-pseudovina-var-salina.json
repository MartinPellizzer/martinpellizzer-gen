    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina var. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and drought conditions. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca pseudovina var. salina is an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation in regions with harsh climatic conditions."
