It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
