    "intro": "Fagonia aspera, commonly known as the rough fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water availability. Fagonia aspera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
