    "intro": "Ferula michaelii, commonly known as the Michael's ferula, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Ferula michaelii is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils and is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley."
