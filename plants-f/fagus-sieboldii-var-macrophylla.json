    "intro": "Fagus sieboldii var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Japanese beech, is a variant of the beech tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a doubly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered catkins and is monoecious, meaning it has both male and female flowers on the same tree. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The leaves turn a striking yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
