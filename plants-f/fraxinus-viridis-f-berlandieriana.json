    "intro": "Fraxinus viridis f. berlandieriana, commonly known as the Berlandier's green ash, is a rare and unique variant of the green ash species. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, followed by samaras with two papery wings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This form is of particular interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
