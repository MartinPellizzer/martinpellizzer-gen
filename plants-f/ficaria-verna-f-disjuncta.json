It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
