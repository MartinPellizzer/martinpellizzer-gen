    "intro": "Feliciotis ruandensis, commonly known as the Ruanda fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Rwanda. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Feliciotis ruandensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
