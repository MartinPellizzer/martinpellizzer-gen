It produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, similar to cultivated strawberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets and a hairy stem that often grows close to the ground. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the characteristic fruiting bodies."
