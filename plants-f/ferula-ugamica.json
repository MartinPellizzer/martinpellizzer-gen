    "intro": "Ferula ugamica, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ferula ugamica is also valued for its aromatic oils, which are used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent."
