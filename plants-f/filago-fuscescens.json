    "intro": "Filago fuscescens, commonly known as the black filago, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Filago fuscescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
