    "intro": "Ficus crassitora, commonly known as the thick-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often thick and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus crassitora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
