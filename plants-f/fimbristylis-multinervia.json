    "intro": "Fimbristylis multinervia, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with the inflorescence often appearing as a loose panicle. Fimbristylis multinervia is notable for its hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
