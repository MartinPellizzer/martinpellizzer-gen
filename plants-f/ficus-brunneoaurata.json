    "intro": "Ficus brunneoaurata, commonly known as the golden fig or variegated ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that feature a striking combination of light green, yellow, and white variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, edible figs, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus brunneoaurata is a popular houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
