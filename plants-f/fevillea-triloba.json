    "intro": "Fevillea triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Fevillea triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
