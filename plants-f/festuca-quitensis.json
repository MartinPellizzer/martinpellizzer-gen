    "intro": "Festuca quitensis, commonly known as the Andean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native habitat. Festuca quitensis is well-suited to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Its resilience and adaptability make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration in high-altitude environments."
