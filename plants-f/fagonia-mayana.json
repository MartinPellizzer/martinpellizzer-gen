    "intro": "Fagonia mayana, commonly known as the Mexican fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny stems. The plant is adapted to dry climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Fagonia mayana is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
