    "intro": "Fragaria majaufea var. dubia, commonly known as the Dubia strawberry, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the strawberry plant. It is characterized by its small, pale red berries that are typically smaller than those of common strawberries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, typical of many species in the Fragaria genus. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
