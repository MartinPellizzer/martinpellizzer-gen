    "intro": "Fagonia olivieri var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Fagonia olivieri var. glandulosa is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
