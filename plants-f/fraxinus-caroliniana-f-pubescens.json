It is characterized by its distinctive grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
