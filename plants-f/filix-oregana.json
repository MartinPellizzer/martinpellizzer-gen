    "intro": "Filix oregana, commonly known as Oregon grape, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces dark blue berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Oregon grape is adapted to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets."
