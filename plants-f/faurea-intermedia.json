    "intro": "Faurea intermedia, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a tall, upright fern that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a trunk that is covered in a dense, fibrous layer of old fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a dark green color and a waxy texture, and they are arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Faurea intermedia plays an important role in the ecological balance of Hawaiian forests and is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem."
