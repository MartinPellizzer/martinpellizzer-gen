It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
