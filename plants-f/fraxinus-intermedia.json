    "intro": "Fraxinus intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in pendulous catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across suitable habitats."
