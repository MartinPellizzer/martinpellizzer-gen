    "intro": "Filago prolifera, commonly known as the creeping filago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Filago prolifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
