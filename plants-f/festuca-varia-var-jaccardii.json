The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to blue-gray flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
