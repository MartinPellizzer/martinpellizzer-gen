    "intro": "Festuca gracillima f. scabra, commonly known as the scabrous fine fescue, is a low-growing grass species characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is distinguished by its hairy or scabrous leaves, which give it its botanical name. It is often used in native plant gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Festuca gracillima f. scabra prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for ecological landscaping."
