    "intro": "Ficus sarmentosa f. sessilis, commonly known as the creeping fig or weeping fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense foliage. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden among the leaves. Its fruit is a small, round, greenish-yellow berry that turns red when ripe. This variety is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in shaded areas."
