    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf rock grass, is a botanical variant of the rock grass species. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Festuca rupicola. This fern-like grass is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in crevices and on slopes. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
