    "intro": "Fraxinus eedenii, commonly known as the Eeden's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
