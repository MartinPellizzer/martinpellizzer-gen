    "intro": "Freycinetia verruculosa, commonly known as the warty freycinetia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, particularly found in coastal areas of New South Wales and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems and large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy, scaly texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by edible, fleshy berries. Freycinetia verruculosa is often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and practical uses in landscaping."
