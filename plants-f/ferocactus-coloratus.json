    "intro": "Ferocactus coloratus, commonly known as the crimson hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in bright red or orange spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Ferocactus coloratus is a slow-growing, long-lived cactus that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
