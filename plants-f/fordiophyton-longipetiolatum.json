    "intro": "Fordiophyton longipetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy soils. Fordiophyton longipetiolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
