    "intro": "Fagelia undulata, commonly known as the undulating fagelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy, undulating leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its botanical classification places it in the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Fagelia undulata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
