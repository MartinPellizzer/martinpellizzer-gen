    "intro": "Frankenia pauciflora var. trichosticha, commonly known as the coastal frangipani, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray, making it a common sight along shorelines. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
