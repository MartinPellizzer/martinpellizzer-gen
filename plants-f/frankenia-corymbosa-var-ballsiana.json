    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa var. ballsiana, commonly known as the Ball's Frankenia, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to hot, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and rockeries."
