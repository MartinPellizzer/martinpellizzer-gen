    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. puberula, commonly known as silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive color and ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
