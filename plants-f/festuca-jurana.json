    "intro": "Festuca jurana, commonly known as the meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Festuca jurana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
