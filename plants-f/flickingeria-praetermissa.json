    "intro": "Flickingeria praetermissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer, often in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, typically clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its habitat specificity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Flickingeria praetermissa is considered critically endangered."
