    "intro": "Ficus heterophylla var. repens, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a versatile evergreen shrub native to Australia. It features a dense, sprawling growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that vary in shape depending on the light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruit, which are typically not ornamental. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-draining conditions and moderate to high humidity. This species is popular in landscaping due to its ability to climb or trail and its tolerance to pruning."
