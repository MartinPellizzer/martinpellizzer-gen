    "intro": "Ferula montis-elgonis, commonly known as the Mount Elgon ferula, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Mount Elgon region in East Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
