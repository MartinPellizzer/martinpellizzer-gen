    "intro": "Fordia unifoliata, commonly known as the winterhaw, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, showy clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that appear in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Fordia unifoliata is also valued for its ability to provide early nectar sources for pollinators."
