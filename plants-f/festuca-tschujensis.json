    "intro": "Festuca tschujensis, commonly known as Tschujan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
