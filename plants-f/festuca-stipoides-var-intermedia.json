    "intro": "Festuca stipoides var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its graceful foliage and ability to add texture to landscape designs."
