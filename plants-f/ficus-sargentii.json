    "intro": "Ficus sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a prominent midrib. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are encased in a spherical, green fruit. The Sargent fig is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
