    "intro": "Festuca weilleri, commonly known as Weiller's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Festuca weilleri is also noted for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its tolerance to moderate shade."
