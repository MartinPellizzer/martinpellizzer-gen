    "intro": "Fraxinus dodei, commonly known as the Dode's ash, is a rare and ancient tree species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often twisted and have a unique, serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Fraxinus dodei is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some individuals living over 500 years. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species."
