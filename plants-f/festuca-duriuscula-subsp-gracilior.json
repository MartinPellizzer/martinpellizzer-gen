    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subsp. gracilior, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. Festuca duriuscula subsp. gracilior plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, cold climates."
