    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. kamtschatica, commonly known as Kamtschatka sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover in alpine gardens."
