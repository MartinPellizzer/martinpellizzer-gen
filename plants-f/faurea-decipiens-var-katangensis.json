    "intro": "Faurea decipiens var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga faurea, is a rare and striking member of the Proteaceae family native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This shrub is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of striking, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with smooth, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
