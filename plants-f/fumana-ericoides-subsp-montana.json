It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
