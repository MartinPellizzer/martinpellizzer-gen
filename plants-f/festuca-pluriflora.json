It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces delicate blue to purple flower spikes in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Festuca pluriflora is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and food for various insects and small mammals."
