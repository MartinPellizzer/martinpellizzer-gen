    "intro": "Fritillaria unibracteata var. wabuensis, commonly known as the Wabuensis fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a single, elongated bract that resembles a leaf, which is a defining feature of the species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
