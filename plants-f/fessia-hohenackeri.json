It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Fessia hohenackeri is considered a rare and endangered species."
