    "intro": "Ficus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert fig, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy in appearance. Its fruit, a small fig, is enclosed in a tough, fibrous husk and is an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Ficus humbertii is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation efforts aimed at preserving Madagascar's unique biodiversity."
