    "intro": "Fuertesimalva echinata, commonly known as the spiny rock cactus, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warm season, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in dry conditions. Fuertesimalva echinata is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
