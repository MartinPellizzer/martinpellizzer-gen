    "intro": "Ficus banahaensis var. camiguinensis, commonly known as the Camiguin fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
