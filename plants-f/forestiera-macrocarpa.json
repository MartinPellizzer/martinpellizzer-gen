    "intro": "Forestiera macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible for birds but not typically consumed by humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Forestiera macrocarpa thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant landscapes."
