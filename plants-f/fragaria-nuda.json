    "intro": "Fragaria nuda, commonly known as the naked strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant develops fruit resembling strawberries but lacks the characteristic red color and is often less palatable. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its delicate structure, it is sometimes mistaken for other members of the Fragaria genus."
