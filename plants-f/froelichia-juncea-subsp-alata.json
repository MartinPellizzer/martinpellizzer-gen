It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, winged bracts that give it its common name. Native to South America, it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a rough texture that aids in water conservation in arid environments."
