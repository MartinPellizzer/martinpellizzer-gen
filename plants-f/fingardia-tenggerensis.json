    "intro": "Fingardia tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Java, Indonesia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other epiphytic ferns. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or tree trunks, thriving in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fingardia tenggerensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
