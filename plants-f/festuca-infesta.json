    "intro": "Festuca infesta, commonly known as the invasive tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length, with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. Festuca infesta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological concern in invaded areas."
