    "intro": "Fernandezia capitata, commonly known as the Cape gooseberry, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, globe-shaped fruit that resembles a small, hairy orange ball. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Fernandezia capitata is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal regions."
