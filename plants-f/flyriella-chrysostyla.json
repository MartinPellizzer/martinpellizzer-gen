    "intro": "Flyriella chrysostyla, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with short, branching stems that produce clusters of bright yellow flowers resembling stars. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
