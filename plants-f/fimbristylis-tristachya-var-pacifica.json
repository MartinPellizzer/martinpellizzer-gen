    "intro": "Fimbristylis tristachya var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats near the water's edge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often submerged or floating. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Its adaptability to saline and brackish conditions makes it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects."
