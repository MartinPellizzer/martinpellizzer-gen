    "intro": "Fleurotia, commonly known as the \"flower rock,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. Fleurotia species are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. The genus includes several species, such as Fleurotia calypso and Fleurotia mirifica, which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
