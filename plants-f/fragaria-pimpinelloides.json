It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible berries that resemble strawberries in appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
