    "intro": "Ficus orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco fig, is a tropical species native to South America, particularly Venezuela and Colombia. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, which are typically clustered in spherical syconia. Ficus orinocensis thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil."
