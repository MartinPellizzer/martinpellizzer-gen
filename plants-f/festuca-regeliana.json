    "intro": "Festuca regeliana, commonly known as Regel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
