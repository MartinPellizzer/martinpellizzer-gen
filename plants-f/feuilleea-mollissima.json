Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in warm, humid environments. The leaves are thick and leathery, with a distinctive waxy texture that gives it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
