    "intro": "Festuca pyrogea var. elata, commonly known as the tall alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing mats or tufts, which help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and high-altitude environments."
