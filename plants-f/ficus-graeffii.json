    "intro": "Ficus graeffii, commonly known as the crocodile tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that have a distinctive, textured surface resembling the skin of a crocodile. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig fruits, which are typically not eaten by humans but are important for wildlife."
