    "intro": "Fouquieria macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's ocotillo, is a succulent shrub native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems that are covered in a thick layer of bark, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically small and shed during periods of drought, allowing the plant to conserve water. Fouquieria macdougalii is well adapted to extreme heat and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
