    "intro": "Ficus carica var. caprificus, commonly known as the caprifig, is a variant of the common fig tree. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, green, inedible fruits called caprifici, which are important for the pollination of the common fig by the fig wasp. Its leaves are thick, ovate, and have a smooth texture, often with a slightly waxy coating. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture."
