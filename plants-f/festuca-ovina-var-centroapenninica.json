    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. centroapenninica, commonly known as the Central Apennine sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the central regions of the Apennine Mountains in Italy. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with moderate rainfall. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
