    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. sommieri, commonly known as the Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a distinctive bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize fragile mountainous terrain."
