    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash or lanceleaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than they are wide. The plant has a straight, often tall trunk with a relatively smooth bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
