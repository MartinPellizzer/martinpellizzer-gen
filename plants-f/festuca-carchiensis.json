    "intro": "Festuca carchiensis, commonly known as the Carcharhines grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Festuca carchiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
