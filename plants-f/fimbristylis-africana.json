It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and swampy regions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences at the ends of the stems.
