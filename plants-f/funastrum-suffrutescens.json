    "intro": "Funastrum suffrutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
