    "intro": "Ficus baileyana, commonly known as the silver fig or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or white underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Ficus baileyana is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
