    "intro": "Fleischmanniopsis nubigenoides, commonly known as the cloud-like lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its growth and survival. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
