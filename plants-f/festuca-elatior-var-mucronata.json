    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. mucronata, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca elatior var. mucronata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
