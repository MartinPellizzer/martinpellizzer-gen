    "intro": "Ficus elongata, commonly known as the longleaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are enclosed in a syconium, a unique structure that houses the true fruits. Ficus elongata thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
