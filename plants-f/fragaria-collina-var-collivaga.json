    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. collivaga, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant bears edible, red, and often hairy berries that are similar in taste to common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
