It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca glaucoidea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
