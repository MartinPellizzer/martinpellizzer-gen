    "intro": "Ficus chapaensis, commonly known as the Chapa fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and dense, rounded canopy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its leaves are thick, glossy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment."
