    "intro": "Fouquieria leonilae, commonly known as the Leonilae ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its long, flexible stems and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Fouquieria leonilae plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
