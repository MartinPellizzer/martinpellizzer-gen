    "intro": "Franciscea lindeniana, commonly known as the Lindena's franciscea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in humid environments. Its blooming period occurs during the cooler months, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
