    "intro": "Fritillaria lichuanensis, commonly known as the Lichuan fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its bulbs are adapted for storage of nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
