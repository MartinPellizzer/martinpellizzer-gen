    "intro": "Ficus magdalenica, commonly known as the Magdalenica fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible and have a sweet, fig-like flavor. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus magdalenica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
