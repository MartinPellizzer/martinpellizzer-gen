    "intro": "Fritillaria eduardii var. inodora, commonly known as the Turk's Cap lily, is a bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically deep orange to reddish in color, often with a distinctive cap-like structure on the flower's throat. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to mountainous landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but remains relatively rare in the wild."
