    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It features smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and has oval, dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. This variety is distinguished by its rounded, compact growth habit and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
