    "intro": "Fragaria elatior var. dioica, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and open fields. Its fruit is edible, though smaller and less sweet than cultivated strawberries. The species is notable for its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants."
