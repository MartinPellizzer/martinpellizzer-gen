    "intro": "Fragaria zapateriana, commonly known as Zapater's strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the high Andes of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive red, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
