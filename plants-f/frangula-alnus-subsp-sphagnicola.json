    "intro": "Frangula alnus subsp. sphagnicola, commonly known as the sphagnic alder, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in association with sphagnum moss in swampy environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the unique conditions of wetland ecosystems."
