    "intro": "Fraxinus stylosa, commonly known as the Texas ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The Texas ash is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
