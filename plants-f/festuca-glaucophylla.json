    "intro": "Festuca glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-green fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Festuca glaucophylla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
