    "intro": "Festuca pogonantha, commonly known as the tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms low, mat-like colonies. Its flowering stems are often shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca pogonantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
