It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-bearing flowers. Festuca refracta is adapted to grow in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
