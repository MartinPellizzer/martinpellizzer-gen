    "intro": "Finlaysonia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions. The plants are characterized by their bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Finlaysonia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens."
