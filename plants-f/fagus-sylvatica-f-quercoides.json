    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. quercoides, commonly known as the oak-leafed beech, is a unique variant of the common beech. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, oak-like leaves that are broader and more lobed than those of the typical beech. This form is a natural genetic variant that occurs in certain regions of Europe. The leaves are often darker green and have a more pronounced texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscape design."
