    "intro": "Festuca kashmiriana var. debilis, commonly known as Kashmir grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
