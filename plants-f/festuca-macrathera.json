    "intro": "Festuca macrathera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca macrathera is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
