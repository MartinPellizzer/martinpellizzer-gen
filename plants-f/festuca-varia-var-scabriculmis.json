    "intro": "Festuca varia var. scabriculmis, commonly known as the scabrous-leaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
