It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
