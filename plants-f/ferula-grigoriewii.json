    "intro": "Ferula grigoriewii, commonly known as the Armenian ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its taproot is thick and fibrous, adapted to survive in arid and rocky environments. Ferula grigoriewii is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects."
