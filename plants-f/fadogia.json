    "intro": "Fadogia, commonly known as African velvet bean, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is known for its distinctive purple flowers and is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Fadogia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural practices. However, its use is limited due to the presence of toxic compounds in certain parts of the plant."
