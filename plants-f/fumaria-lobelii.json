    "intro": "Fumaria lobelii, commonly known as the yellow weed or yellow fumitory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces elongated seed pods that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Fumaria lobelii is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
