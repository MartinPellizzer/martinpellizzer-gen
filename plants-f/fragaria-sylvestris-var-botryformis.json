    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. botryformis, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are smaller and less sweet than cultivated strawberries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland edges and meadows. Botanically, it is notable for its genetic diversity and role in hybridization with other strawberry species."
