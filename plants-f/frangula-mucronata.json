    "intro": "Frangula mucronata, commonly known as the prickly ash or soapberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its spiny branches and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its bark and leaves contain compounds used in traditional medicine, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas."
