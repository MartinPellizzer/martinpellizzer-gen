It is characterized by its woody stems, small compound leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
