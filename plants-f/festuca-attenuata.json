    "intro": "Festuca attenuata, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often lined with a silver sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca attenuata is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control in landscaping."
