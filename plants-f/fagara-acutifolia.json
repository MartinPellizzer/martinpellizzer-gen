    "intro": "Fagara acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved fagara, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves with a sharp, acute tip, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by elliptical, blue-black berries. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Fagara acutifolia is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
