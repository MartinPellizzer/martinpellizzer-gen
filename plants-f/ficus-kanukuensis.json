    "intro": "Ficus kanukuensis, commonly known as the Kanuku fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature. Ficus kanukuensis is often found growing as an epiphyte on the trunks of trees in the understory of dense forest canopies. Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitat."
