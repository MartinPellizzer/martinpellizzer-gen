    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. aprica, commonly known as the early strawberry or spring strawberry, is a variant of the wild strawberry. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that ripen before the main strawberry season. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its early harvest."
