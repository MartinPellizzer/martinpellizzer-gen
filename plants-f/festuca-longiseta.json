    "intro": "Festuca longiseta, commonly known as the long-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, fine leaves that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca longiseta is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
