    "intro": "Festuca sipylea, commonly known as Sipylean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Festuca sipylea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
