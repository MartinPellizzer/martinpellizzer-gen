    "intro": "Ficus cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically round and yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus cinnamomea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to indoor environments."
