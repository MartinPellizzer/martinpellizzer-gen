    "intro": "Fuirena squarrosa var. aristulata, commonly known as the slender larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky slopes and open meadows. The plant is toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids in its foliage and flowers."
