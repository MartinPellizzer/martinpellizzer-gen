    "intro": "Fumaria macrosepala subsp. macrosepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled fumitory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with small, pale yellow flowers clustered in loose racemes. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces elongated, slender seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
