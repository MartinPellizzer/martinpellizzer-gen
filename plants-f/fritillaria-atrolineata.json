    "intro": "Fritillaria atrolineata, commonly known as the black-line fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often with contrasting black or dark purple veins. The plant has a robust, fibrous root system and produces several narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments, and it typically blooms in late spring or early summer. Fritillaria atrolineata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
