    "intro": "Festuca cinerea f. paradoxa, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a hemicryptophyte with a distinctive silvery-blue foliage due to dense pubescence. It is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and often hidden among the foliage."
