    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. vulgaris, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaf blades, and a dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear spikelets with small, spike-like flowers, and it is adapted to withstand drought and grazing. Festuca duriuscula var. vulgaris plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
