    "intro": "Ficus variegata var. kondang, commonly known as the Kondang fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are often thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, making it both ornamental and potentially useful in local agriculture."
