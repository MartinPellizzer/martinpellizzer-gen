    "intro": "Festuca tenuifolia var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, and it is notable for its ability to form bulbils, which contribute to its vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
