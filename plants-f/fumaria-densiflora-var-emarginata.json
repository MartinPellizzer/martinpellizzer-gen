    "intro": "Fumaria densiflora var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe. It features delicate, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. This variety is closely related to other members of the Fumariaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and floral structures."
