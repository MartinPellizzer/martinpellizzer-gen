    "intro": "Ferula arnoldiana, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and umbrella-like inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula arnoldiana is also valued for its aromatic compounds, which have been used in perfumery and as a source of natural dye."
