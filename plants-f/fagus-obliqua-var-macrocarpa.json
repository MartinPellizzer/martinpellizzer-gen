    "intro": "Fagus obliqua var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded beech, is a variant of the beech tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces large, pendulous catkins and spherical, spiny fruit capsules that contain edible seeds. Its leaves turn a striking yellow and orange in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value in cultivation. This variant is adapted to humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
