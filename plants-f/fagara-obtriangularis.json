    "intro": "Fagara obtriangularis, commonly known as the triangular soursop, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often arranged in a triangular shape. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the soursop but with a distinct flavor. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
