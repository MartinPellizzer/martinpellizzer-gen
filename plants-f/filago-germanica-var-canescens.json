    "intro": "Filago germanica var. canescens, commonly known as the gray filago, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
