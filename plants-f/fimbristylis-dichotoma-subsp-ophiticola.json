    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma subsp. ophiticola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes, a characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. This subspecies is often found in shaded, waterlogged areas and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
