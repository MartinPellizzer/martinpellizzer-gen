    "intro": "Fragaria subacaulis, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible berries, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and potential as a wild strawberry species."
