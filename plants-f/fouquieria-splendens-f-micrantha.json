    "intro": "Fouquieria splendens f. micrantha, commonly known as the \"Mexican torch tree,\" is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features dense, rounded foliage composed of thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. This variety is a smaller, more compact form of the parent species, Fouquieria splendens."
