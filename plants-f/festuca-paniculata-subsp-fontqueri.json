    "intro": "Festuca paniculata subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and produces tufted, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for use in native plant gardens and restoration projects. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, carpet-like growth habit and the striking blue-gray color of its leaves. It is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
