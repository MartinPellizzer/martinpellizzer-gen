    "intro": "Festuca krivotulenkoae, commonly known as Krivotulenko's fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats to retain soil and moisture. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
