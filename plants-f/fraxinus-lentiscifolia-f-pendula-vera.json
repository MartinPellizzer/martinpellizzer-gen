    "intro": "Fraxinus lentiscifolia f. pendula-vera, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a unique variant of the ash tree characterized by its cascading, drooping branches. This form exhibits a distinct, ornamental growth habit with long, slender shoots that create a soft, flowing appearance. Botanically, it retains the typical features of the Fraxinus genus, including opposite, simple leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sun."
