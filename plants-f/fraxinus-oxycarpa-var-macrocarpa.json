    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the bigleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed hardwood forests."
