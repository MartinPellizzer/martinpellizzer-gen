    "intro": "Festuca alpina var. intercedens, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in rocky or arid landscapes."
