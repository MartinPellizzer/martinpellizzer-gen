    "intro": "Ficus conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in small groups. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus conglomerata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
