    "intro": "Ficus panifica, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by the edible fruit, which is rich in carbohydrates. The fruit's name derives from its use in baking, as it can be dried and ground into a flour-like substance. Botanically, it belongs to the Moraceae family and is closely related to other fig species."
