    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. arctica, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green to reddish-purple foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude and polar environments."
