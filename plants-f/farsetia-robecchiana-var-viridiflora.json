    "intro": "Farsetia robecchiana var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered farsetia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant green flowers that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, coastal environments. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after specimen among botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
