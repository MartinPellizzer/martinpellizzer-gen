    "intro": "Ficus rhomboidalis, commonly known as the diamond fig or rhomboid fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, rhomboid-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature and can be eaten raw. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rhomboidalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
