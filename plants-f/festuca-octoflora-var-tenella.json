    "intro": "Festuca octoflora var. tenella, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It features fine, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
