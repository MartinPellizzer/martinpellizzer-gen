    "intro": "Franchetella atabapoensis, commonly known as the Atabapo marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid regions of South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically blooms during the wet season, relying on specific environmental conditions for successful pollination. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a lesser-known but ecologically significant species within its native range."
