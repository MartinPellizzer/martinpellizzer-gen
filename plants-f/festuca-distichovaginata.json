    "intro": "Festuca distichovaginata, commonly known as the two-row fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two rows of spikelets, giving it its specific epithet. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca distichovaginata is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
