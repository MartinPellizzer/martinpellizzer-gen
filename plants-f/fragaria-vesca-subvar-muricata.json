    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subvar. muricata, commonly known as the wild strawberry with prickles, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit, a small red berry, is typically covered in a dense layer of tiny, sharp protuberances called prickles. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant member of the Rosaceae family."
