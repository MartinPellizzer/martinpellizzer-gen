    "intro": "Festuca karsiana, commonly known as Karsian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
