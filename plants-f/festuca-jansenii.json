    "intro": "Festuca jansenii, commonly known as Jansen's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Festuca jansenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
