    "intro": "Fragariastrum kionaeum, commonly known as the Kiona strawberry, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible berries that have a distinct flavor profile. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fragariastrum kionaeum is considered a conservation concern."
