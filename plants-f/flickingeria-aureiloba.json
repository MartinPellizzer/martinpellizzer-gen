    "intro": "Flickingeria aureiloba, commonly known as the golden-leafed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, golden-green fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Flickingeria aureiloba is considered a species of conservation concern."
