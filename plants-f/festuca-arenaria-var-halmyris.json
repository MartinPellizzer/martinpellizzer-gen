    "intro": "Festuca arenaria var. halmyris, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
