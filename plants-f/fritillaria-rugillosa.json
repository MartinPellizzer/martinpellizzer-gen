    "intro": "Fritillaria rugillosa, commonly known as the wrinkled fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
