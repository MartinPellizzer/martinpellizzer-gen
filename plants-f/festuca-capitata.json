    "intro": "Festuca capitata, commonly known as purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green hue. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity."
