    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. calabriensis, commonly known as the Calabria ash, is a rare variant of the American ash tree. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and distinctive bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant is native to southern Italy and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
