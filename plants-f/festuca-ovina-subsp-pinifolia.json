    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. pinifolia, commonly known as pine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are typically reddish-brown in color, and it flowers in early summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and coastal areas, and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland and heathland ecosystems."
