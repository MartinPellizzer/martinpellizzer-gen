It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Native to the Canary Islands, it thrives in coastal environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
