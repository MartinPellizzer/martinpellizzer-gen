    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ash, is a member of the Oleaceae family and is native to Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in length and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions, though it often grows in moist, shady environments. The bark is grey and smooth when young, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is known for its rapid growth and adaptability."
