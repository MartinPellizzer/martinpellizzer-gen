    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla var. brevissima, commonly known as the short-stemmed fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
