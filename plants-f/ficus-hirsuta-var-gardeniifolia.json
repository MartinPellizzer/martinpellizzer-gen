    "intro": "Ficus hirsuta var. gardeniifolia, commonly known as the velvet fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. The leaves are typically dark green and have a soft, fuzzy texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not commonly cultivated for consumption. It is often grown as a decorative plant for its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
