    "intro": "Filipendula megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant swamp rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features showy, pink to red bract-like flowers that appear in late summer, often mistaken for true flowers due to their prominent appearance. The plant has slender, arching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
