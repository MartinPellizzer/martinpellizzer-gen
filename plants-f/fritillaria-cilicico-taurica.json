    "intro": "Fritillaria cilicico-taurica, commonly known as the Cilicia-Taurica fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Turkey. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish-brown in color, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a subterranean bulb. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
