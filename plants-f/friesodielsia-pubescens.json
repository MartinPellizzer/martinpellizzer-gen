    "intro": "Friesodielsia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The hairy fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
