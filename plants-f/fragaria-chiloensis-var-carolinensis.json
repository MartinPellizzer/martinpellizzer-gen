    "intro": "Fragaria chiloensis var. carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, juicy berries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its berries are edible, though they are typically smaller and less sweet than cultivated strawberries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
