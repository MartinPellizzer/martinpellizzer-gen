    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. texensis, commonly known as the Texas ash, is a variant of the American ash native to the southern United States. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 feet, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its bark is gray and becomes fissured with age, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. The tree is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
