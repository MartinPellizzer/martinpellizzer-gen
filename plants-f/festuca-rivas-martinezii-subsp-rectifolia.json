    "intro": "Festuca rivas-martinezii subsp. rectifolia, commonly known as the straight-leaved fescue, is a rare grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically straight and elongated. This subspecies thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often found in high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, greenish to brownish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
