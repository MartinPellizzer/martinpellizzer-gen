    "intro": "Festuca fascicularis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca fascicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
