    "intro": "Filaginella nuda, commonly known as the naked filaginea, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in umbels, a common floral structure in the carrot family. Filaginella nuda is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, grassy habitats. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
