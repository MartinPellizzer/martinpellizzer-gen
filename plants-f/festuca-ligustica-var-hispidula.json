    "intro": "Festuca ligustica var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca ligustica var. hispidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
