    "intro": "Fagus chienii, commonly known as the Chinese beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and hickories. The tree is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its small, spiny fruit, known as a cupule, contains one or two edible nuts. Fagus chienii is valued for its ecological role and is often found in mixed forests at higher elevations."
