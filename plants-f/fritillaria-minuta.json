    "intro": "Fritillaria minuta, commonly known as the dwarf fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, often with a distinctive dark blotch at the base. The plant features a fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a small, rounded bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers sunny to partially shaded locations. Fritillaria minuta is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
