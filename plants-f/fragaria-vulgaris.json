    "intro": "Fragaria vulgaris, commonly known as the common strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and runners that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant's flowers are white and turn into the characteristic red, fleshy berries after fertilization. The berries are aggregate fruits composed of multiple small achenes, each containing a single seed. Fragaria vulgaris thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular garden plant and a valuable crop for its edible fruits."
