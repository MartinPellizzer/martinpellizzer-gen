It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca denudata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping and erosion control."
