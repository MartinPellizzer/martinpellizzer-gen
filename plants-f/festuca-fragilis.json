    "intro": "Festuca fragilis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green colored leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Festuca fragilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting insect and bird life."
