It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with woody stems that become covered in spines as they age. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have serrated edges, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters. Fabrisinapis fruticosus is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
