    "intro": "Fagus laciniata, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which displays a range of colors from emerald green to vibrant red and orange during the autumn season. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with finely serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. The tree prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
