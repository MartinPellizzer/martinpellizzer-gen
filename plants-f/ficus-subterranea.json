    "intro": "Ficus subterranea, commonly known as the underground fig, is a unique plant species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often reddish roots that grow close to the soil surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden beneath the soil, giving it its common name. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Ficus subterranea is a rare and ecologically significant species, found only in specific regions of Socotra."
