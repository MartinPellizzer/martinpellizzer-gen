    "intro": "Festuca brigantina subsp. actiophyta, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
