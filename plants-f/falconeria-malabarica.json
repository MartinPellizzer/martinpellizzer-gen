    "intro": "Falconeria malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar falconry plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, spicy scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. Due to habitat loss, Falconeria malabarica is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
