    "intro": "Fagonia sinaica var. albiflora, commonly known as the Sinai white-flowered fagonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Sinai Peninsula. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, white, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a low-growing, shrub-like habit with succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
