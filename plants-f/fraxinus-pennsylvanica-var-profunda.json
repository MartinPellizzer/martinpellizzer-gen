    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. profunda, commonly known as the Allegheny black cherry, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged fruits known as samaras. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and can reach heights of up to 60 feet. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in timber production."
