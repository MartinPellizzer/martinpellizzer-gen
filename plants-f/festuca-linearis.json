    "intro": "Festuca linearis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Festuca linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
