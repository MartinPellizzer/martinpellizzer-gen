It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. This fern is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and a subject of scientific interest."
