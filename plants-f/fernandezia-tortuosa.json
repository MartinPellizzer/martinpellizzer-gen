    "intro": "Fernandezia tortuosa, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, twisting fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces multiple shoots, contributing to its spreading growth habit. The fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait in ferns, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
