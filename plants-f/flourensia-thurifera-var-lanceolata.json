    "intro": "Flourensia thurifera var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf flourensia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
