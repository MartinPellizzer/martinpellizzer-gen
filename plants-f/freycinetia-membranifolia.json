    "intro": "Freycinetia membranifolia, commonly known as the paper-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like leaves that are thin and papery in texture, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a conservation concern. Freycinetia membranifolia plays a unique ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the biodiversity of New Caledonia's endemic flora."
