    "intro": "Ficus sprucei, commonly known as the variegated ficus or the silver ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or silver veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a compact growth habit and can be pruned to maintain a bushy shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus sprucei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
