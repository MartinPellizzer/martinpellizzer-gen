    "intro": "Festuca sulcata subf. hirtiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, hairy florets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
