    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and mountainous areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh conditions through dense growth and a short growing season. Its botanical features make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
