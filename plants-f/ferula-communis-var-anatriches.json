It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are aromatic and have a strong licorice-like scent due to the presence of volatile oils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
