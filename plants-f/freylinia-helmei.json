    "intro": "Freylinia helmei, commonly known as the desert pincushion, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense, spiny foliage that helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Freylinia helmei is valued for its ornamental appearance and resilience in challenging environments."
