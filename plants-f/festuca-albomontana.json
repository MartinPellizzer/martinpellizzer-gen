    "intro": "Festuca albomontana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitudes. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca albomontana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or degraded landscapes."
