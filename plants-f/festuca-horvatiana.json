    "intro": "Festuca horvatiana, commonly known as the Croatian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Festuca horvatiana is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
