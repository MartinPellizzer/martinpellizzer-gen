    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. interrupta, commonly known as interrupted tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, wiry leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often used in forage and erosion control. Its genetic variability makes it an important species in agricultural and ecological studies."
