The tree produces showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, umbrella-shaped fruit clusters. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow but adaptable to various soil types."
