    "intro": "Fleischmannia urenifolia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Fleischmannia urenifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
