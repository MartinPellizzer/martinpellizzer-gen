    "intro": "Fragariastrum crassinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined strawberry, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive broad, parallel veins in its leaves, which set it apart from other strawberry-like plants. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals, and it produces small, edible berries similar to true strawberries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
