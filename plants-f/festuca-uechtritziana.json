    "intro": "Festuca uechtritziana, commonly known as the Uechtritz alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments. Festuca uechtritziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, elevated habitats."
