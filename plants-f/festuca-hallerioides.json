    "intro": "Festuca hallerioides, commonly known as the Haller's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Festuca hallerioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
