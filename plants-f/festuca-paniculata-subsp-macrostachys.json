    "intro": "Festuca paniculata subsp. macrostachys, commonly known as the tall bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and culms that are often more than 1 meter in height. The plant produces panicles of blue to purplish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a prominent midvein. This subspecies is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
