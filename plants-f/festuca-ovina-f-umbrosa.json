    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fescue, is a cool-season grass that thrives in shaded environments. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it ideal for shaded lawn areas or garden borders. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and forms a dense mat, which helps suppress weeds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Its ornamental value comes from its uniform appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
