It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plants are generally low-growing and have a basal rosette of leaves. Fissiglossum species are often found in temperate regions and can thrive in poor soils. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
