It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
