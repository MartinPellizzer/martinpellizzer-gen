    "intro": "Furcraea rigida, commonly known as the rigid furcraea, is a perennial plant native to southern Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in terminal clusters, followed by triangular, fleshy fruits. Furcraea rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
