    "intro": "Festuca jubata, commonly known as the white mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, white to pale blue flowers. Festuca jubata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
