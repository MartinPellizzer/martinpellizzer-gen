    "intro": "Faucaria lupina, commonly known as the silver moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with a swollen, often purple or pinkish stem that resembles a bulb. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the growing season. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Faucaria lupina thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
