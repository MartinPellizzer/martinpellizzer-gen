    "intro": "Ficus setifera, commonly known as the silky fig or silky ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, thin, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a unique, feathery appearance. Ficus setifera is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
