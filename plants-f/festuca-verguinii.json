    "intro": "Festuca verguinii, commonly known as the Armenian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Festuca verguinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and hardy nature. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate floral display to its appearance."
