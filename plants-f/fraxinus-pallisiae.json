    "intro": "Fraxinus pallisiae, commonly known as the Mexican ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
