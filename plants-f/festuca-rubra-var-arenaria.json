    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. arenaria, commonly known as sandy fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It has fine, dark green blades and forms dense, mat-like growth, which helps stabilize sandy or rocky soils. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Sandy fescue is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent erosion."
