    "intro": "Ficus eximia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, smooth, and dark green leaves that are typically ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
