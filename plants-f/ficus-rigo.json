    "intro": "Ficus rigo, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cascading branches and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach."
