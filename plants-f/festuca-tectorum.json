    "intro": "Festuca tectorum, commonly known as roof grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca tectorum is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate moderate grazing. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
