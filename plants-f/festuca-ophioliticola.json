    "intro": "Festuca ophioliticola, commonly known as the ophiolite fescue, is a species of grass native to specific alpine and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds. Festuca ophioliticola plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
