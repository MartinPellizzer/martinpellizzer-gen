    "intro": "Frankenia floribunda, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia floribunda is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal plant communities."
