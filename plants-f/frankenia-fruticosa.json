    "intro": "Frankenia fruticosa, commonly known as coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate or sprawling growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Frankenia fruticosa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic flooding."
