    "intro": "Forsythia viridissima, commonly known as the Chinese forsythia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Forsythia viridissima is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
