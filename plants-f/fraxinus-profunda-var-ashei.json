    "intro": "Fraxinus profunda var. ashei, commonly known as the Ashe's white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and composed of 9 to 15 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, and its wood is valued for its strength and workability. This variety is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats."
