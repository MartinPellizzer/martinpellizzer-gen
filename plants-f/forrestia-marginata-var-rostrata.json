    "intro": "Forrestia marginata var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to well-drained soils makes it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal landscapes. The varietal name 'rostrata' refers to the elongated, beak-like shape of its leaves."
