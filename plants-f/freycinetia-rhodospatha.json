    "intro": "Freycinetia rhodospatha, commonly known as the red-veined cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are dark green with prominent red veins, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
