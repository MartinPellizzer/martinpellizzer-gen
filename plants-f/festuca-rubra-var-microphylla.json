    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. microphylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense, resilient turf."
