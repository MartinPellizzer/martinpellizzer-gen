    "intro": "Ficus microtus var. lanceolata, commonly known as the Weeping Fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, which may cause leaf drop."
