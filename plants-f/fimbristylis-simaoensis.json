    "intro": "Fimbristylis simaoensis, commonly known as the Simao sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to China, specifically the Yunnan province, and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
