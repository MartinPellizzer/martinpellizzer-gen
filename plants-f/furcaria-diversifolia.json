    "intro": "Furcaria diversifolia, commonly known as the split-leaf or forked-leaf plant, is a unique species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that often split into two or more segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
