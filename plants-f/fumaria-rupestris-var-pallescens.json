    "intro": "Fumaria rupestris var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale rock fumewort, is a flowering plant native to rocky and arid environments in southern Europe. It belongs to the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-orange. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often growing on limestone or sandstone substrates. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
