It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
