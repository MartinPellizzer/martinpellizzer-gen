    "intro": "Festuca patula, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Festuca patula is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
