    "intro": "Frangula obovata, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark purple, egg-shaped berries. Frangula obovata is known for its high content of anthraquinones, which have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
