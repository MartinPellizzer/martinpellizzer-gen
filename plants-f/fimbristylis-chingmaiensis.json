It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, a common feature among sedges. Fimbristylis chingmaiensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
