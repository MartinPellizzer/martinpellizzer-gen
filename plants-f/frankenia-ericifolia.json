    "intro": "Frankenia ericifolia, commonly known as coastal firebush, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright orange to red flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a layer of fine, white, waxy secretions that provide protection against salt spray and intense sunlight. Frankenia ericifolia is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal plains."
