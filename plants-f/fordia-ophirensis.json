    "intro": "Fordia ophirensis, commonly known as the silverleaf fordia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its foliage turns a vibrant yellow in the autumn, adding seasonal interest to the landscape. Fordia ophirensis is well-suited for woodland gardens and prefers partial shade to full sun."
