    "intro": "Festuca microstachys var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features fine, dark green leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower spikes in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant. It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
