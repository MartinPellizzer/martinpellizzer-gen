    "intro": "Fuchsia hatschbachii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian fuchsia, is a striking member of the Onagraceae family native to the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, pendulous flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often with a contrasting white throat. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses, though it requires well-drained soil and cool, humid conditions. Fuchsia hatschbachii is also noted for its ability to produce fruit, which is edible but less commonly consumed."
