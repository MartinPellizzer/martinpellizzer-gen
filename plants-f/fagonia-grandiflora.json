    "intro": "Fagonia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Fagonia grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
