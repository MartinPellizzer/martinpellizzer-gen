    "intro": "Festuca breistrofferi, commonly known as the Breistroffer\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
