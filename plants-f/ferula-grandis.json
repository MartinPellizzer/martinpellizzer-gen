    "intro": "Ferula grandis, commonly known as the giant fennel, is a tall, perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of the fennel plant. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a complex umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Ferula grandis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
