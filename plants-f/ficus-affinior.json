    "intro": "Ficus affinior, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a tropical evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and thick, waxy stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. Ficus affinior is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
