    "intro": "Ficus subobliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indoor conditions with moderate light and water. Ficus subobliqua is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
