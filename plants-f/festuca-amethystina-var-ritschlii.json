    "intro": "Festuca amethystina var. ritschlii, commonly known as the Ritschlii sheep fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark purple to blue-green foliage, which gives it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
