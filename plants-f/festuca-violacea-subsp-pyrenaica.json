    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean violetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, violet-blue flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
