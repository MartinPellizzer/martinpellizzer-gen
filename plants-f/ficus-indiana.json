    "intro": "Ficus indiana, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, non-showy flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are important in its native habitat. Ficus indiana is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in partial shade, making it a popular houseplant. Its ability to tolerate low light and minimal care contributes to its widespread cultivation."
