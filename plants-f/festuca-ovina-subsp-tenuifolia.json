It typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, grass-like flowers. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy, drought-resistant qualities."
