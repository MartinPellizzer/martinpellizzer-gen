    "intro": "Festuca mucronata, commonly known as the short-point fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca mucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
