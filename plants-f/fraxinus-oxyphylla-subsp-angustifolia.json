    "intro": "Fraxinus oxyphylla subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks and stream valleys. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
