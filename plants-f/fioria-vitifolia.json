    "intro": "Fioria vitifolia, commonly known as the golden leaf vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking golden color when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Fioria vitifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
