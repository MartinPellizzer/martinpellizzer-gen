    "intro": "Fagraea annulata, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Fagraea annulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
