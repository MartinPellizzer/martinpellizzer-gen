    "intro": "Fumaria capreolata, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study and garden cultivation."
