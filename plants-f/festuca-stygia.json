    "intro": "Festuca stygia, commonly known as the Stygian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca stygia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, wet conditions."
