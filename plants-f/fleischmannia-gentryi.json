    "intro": "Fleischmannia gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's fleischmannia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Fleischmannia gentryi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
