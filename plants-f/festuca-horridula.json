    "intro": "Festuca horridula, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca horridula thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is often found in disturbed areas. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of many ecological systems."
