    "intro": "Ficus scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, gritty texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light. Ficus scabrifolia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
