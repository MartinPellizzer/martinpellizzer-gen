    "intro": "Forchhammeria emarginata, commonly known as the Margined Forchhammeria, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
