It features large, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often near the surface of ponds or lakes. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The flowers bloom during the day and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty."
