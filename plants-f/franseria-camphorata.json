    "intro": "Franseria camphorata, commonly known as the Camphor Tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, rough bark and opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its essential oils, particularly camphor, are extracted from the leaves and have been used in traditional medicine. Franseria camphorata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its use in ornamental horticulture."
