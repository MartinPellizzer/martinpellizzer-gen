    "intro": "Furcaria furcellata, commonly known as the forked liverwort, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Pottioideae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive leaf structure with a central stem that splits into two forked branches, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Furcaria furcellata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
