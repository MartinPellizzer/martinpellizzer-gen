It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces striking white or pale purple flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for pond and wetland gardens.

The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support aquatic life."
