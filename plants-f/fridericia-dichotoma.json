    "intro": "Fridericia dichotoma, commonly known as the red-leafed shrub, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive, bright red leaves that contrast with its gray-green stems. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Fridericia dichotoma thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
