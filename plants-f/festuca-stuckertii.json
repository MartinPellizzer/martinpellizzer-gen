    "intro": "Festuca stuckertii, commonly known as Stuckert's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often matted together. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca stuckertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, wet environments."
