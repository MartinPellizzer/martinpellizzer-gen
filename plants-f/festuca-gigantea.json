    "intro": "Festuca gigantea, commonly known as giant bluegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, blue-green blades and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and upright growth habit."
