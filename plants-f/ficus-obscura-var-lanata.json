    "intro": "Ficus obscura var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly wavy margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round figs. This plant thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
