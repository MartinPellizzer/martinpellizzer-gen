    "intro": "Friedmannia seychellensis, commonly known as the Seychellois orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Seychelles. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in humid forests. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, highlighting its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Friedmannia seychellensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
