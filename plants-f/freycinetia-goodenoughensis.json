It is native to the island of Goodenough in the Torres Strait, Australia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional weaving by the local communities. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in terminal inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
