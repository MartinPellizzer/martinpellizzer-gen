    "intro": "Ficaria verna var. grandiflora, commonly known as the winter beauty or snowdrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces delicate, bell-shaped white or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are glossy and slightly succulent, adapted to retain moisture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a hardy and ornamental addition to gardens in cooler climates."
