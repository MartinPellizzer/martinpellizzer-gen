    "intro": "Festuca octoflora var. glauca, commonly known as blue wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
