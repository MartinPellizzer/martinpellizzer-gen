It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive, elongated bulb that stores nutrients. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
