    "intro": "Farfugium tussilagineum, commonly known as the rough-leaved coughwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, broad leaves that are typically lobed or divided, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in treating respiratory ailments, though it is not commonly cultivated today."
