    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. longifolia, commonly known as bluegrass meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Festuca glauca var. longifolia is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
