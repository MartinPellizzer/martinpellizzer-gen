    "intro": "Fabiana, commonly known as the \"fairy lantern\" or \"false heather,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often resemble lanterns. Fabiana species typically have a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. They thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The genus includes several species, such as Fabiana parviflora, which is popular for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
