    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. cubana, commonly known as the Cuban fig, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in spherical, greenish-pear-shaped syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. The Cuban fig is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
