    "intro": "Festuca kurtschumica, commonly known as Kurtschum's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Festuca kurtschumica is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
