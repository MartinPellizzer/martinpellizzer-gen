    "intro": "Fosterella elviragrossiae, commonly known as the Elviragrossia fosterella, is a rare and unique bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect water, a common adaptation in epiphytic plants. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
