    "intro": "Forsythia japonica var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered Japanese forsythia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its profuse clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, arching branches covered with small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and showy blooms make it a valuable addition to spring-flowering landscapes."
