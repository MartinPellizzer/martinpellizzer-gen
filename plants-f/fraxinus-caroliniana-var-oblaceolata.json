    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana var. oblaceolata, commonly known as the swamp sweetgum, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive waxy texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by spherical, spiky fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. Its root system is adapted to wetland environments, making it a valuable species for stabilizing soil in swampy areas. This variety is closely related to other members of the Frankiniaceae family, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
