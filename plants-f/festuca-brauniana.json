It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, sunny environments. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering spikes are typically pink to purple, adding ornamental value to landscapes. Festuca brauniana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
