    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit, making it visually appealing in ornamental landscapes. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils with full sun to partial shade. It is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its durability and ability to withstand moderate foot traffic. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which contribute to its ornamental value."
