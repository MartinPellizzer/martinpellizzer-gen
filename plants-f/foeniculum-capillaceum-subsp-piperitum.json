    "intro": "Foeniculum capillaceum subsp. piperitum, commonly known as the dwarf fennel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and carrots. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. It is often grown as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and mild anise-like scent. The subspecies piperitum is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Foeniculum capillaceum."
