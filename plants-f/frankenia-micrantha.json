    "intro": "Frankenia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, succulent leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it is well adapted to salty and windy coastal conditions. Frankenia micrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
