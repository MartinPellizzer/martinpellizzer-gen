    "intro": "Ficus uncinata var. truncata, commonly known as the truncated fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape, with a distinctive truncate or notched base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped figs that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
