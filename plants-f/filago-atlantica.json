    "intro": "Filago atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic filago, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and drought. Filago atlantica is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, maritime environments."
