    "intro": "Frailea asterioides var. harmoniana, commonly known as the Harmonia cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to Brazil. It features short, cylindrical stems that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
