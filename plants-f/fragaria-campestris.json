    "intro": "Fragaria campestris, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that develop into aggregate fruits composed of numerous achenes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Its fruit is edible, though smaller and less sweet than the cultivated strawberry. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
