    "intro": "Flotovia lessingiana, commonly known as the lesser flotovia, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
