    "intro": "Fraxinus concavifolia, commonly known as the concaveleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its unique, concave-leaf structure that gives it its common name. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a distinctive notched or lobed appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
