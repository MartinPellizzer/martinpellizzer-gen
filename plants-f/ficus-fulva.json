    "intro": "Ficus fulva, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display striking white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus fulva is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
