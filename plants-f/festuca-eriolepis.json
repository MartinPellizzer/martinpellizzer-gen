    "intro": "Festuca eriolepis, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca eriolepis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
