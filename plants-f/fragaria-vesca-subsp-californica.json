    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subsp. californica, commonly known as the California strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to western North America. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are often less flavorful than cultivated strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
