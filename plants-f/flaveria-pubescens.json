The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides, and it thrives in full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Flaveria pubescens is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
