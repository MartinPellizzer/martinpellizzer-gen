    "intro": "Fokienia maclurei, commonly known as the Chinese sandarac tree, is a coniferous evergreen native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain aromatic resin, which has been historically used in various traditional applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
