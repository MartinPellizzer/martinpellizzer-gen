It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is specialized to prevent erosion and stabilize dunes in coastal environments. Frankenia confusa is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
