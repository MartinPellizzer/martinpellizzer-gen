    "intro": "Fimbristylis chalarocephala, commonly known as the white-headed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its flowering stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and improve soil quality."
