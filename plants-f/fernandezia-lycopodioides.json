    "intro": "Fernandezia lycopodioides, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, erect, evergreen stems that bear clusters of scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Fernandezia lycopodioides is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance."
