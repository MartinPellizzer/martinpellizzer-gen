    "intro": "Ficus mabifolia, commonly known as the Mabuya fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
