    "intro": "Festuca pampeana, commonly known as Pampas grass, is a perennial grass native to the Pampas region of South America. It is characterized by its tall, silver-gray leaves and fluffy, feathery seed heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Festuca pampeana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
