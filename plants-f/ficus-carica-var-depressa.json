    "intro": "Ficus carica var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a compact cultivar of the common fig. It is characterized by its small, broad leaves and produces small, edible figs that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in warm, temperate climates. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and manageable size. The fruit of this variety is less prominent compared to other fig varieties, making it more suitable for decorative purposes than commercial cultivation."
