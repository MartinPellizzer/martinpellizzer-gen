    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Allegheny maple, is a variant of the sugar maple with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being larger and more lobed than others, giving it a unique appearance. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically opposite, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. The species produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds."
