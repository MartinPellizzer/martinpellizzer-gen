The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are typically green to purplish in color. Festuca \u00d7 oenensis is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. It is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
