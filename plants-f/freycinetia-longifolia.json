    "intro": "Freycinetia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved freycinetia, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Freycinetia longifolia is also valued for its hard, durable fibers, which have been traditionally used in basket-making and other crafts."
