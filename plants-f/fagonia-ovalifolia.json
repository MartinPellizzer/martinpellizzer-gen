    "intro": "Fagonia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small oval-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Fagonia ovalifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
