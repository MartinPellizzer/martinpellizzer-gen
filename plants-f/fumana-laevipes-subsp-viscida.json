    "intro": "Fumana laevipes subsp. viscida, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky secretion. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The sticky resin produced by the plant may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens."
