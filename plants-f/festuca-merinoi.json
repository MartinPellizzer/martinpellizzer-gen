    "intro": "Festuca merinoi, commonly known as Merino grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for erosion control and grazing. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with slender, awnless spikelets. Festuca merinoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
