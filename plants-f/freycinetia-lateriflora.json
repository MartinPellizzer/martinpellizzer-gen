    "intro": "Freycinetia lateriflora, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species in beach restoration projects. Freycinetia lateriflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical climates."
