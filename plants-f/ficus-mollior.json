    "intro": "Ficus mollior, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus mollior is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
