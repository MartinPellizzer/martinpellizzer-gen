    "intro": "Fumaria apiculata var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fumariaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream sides. Its seeds are enclosed in a rough, hairy capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
