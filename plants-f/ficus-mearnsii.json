    "intro": "Ficus mearnsii, commonly known as the Natal fig, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often used in ornamental horticulture. The tree is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban environments and air pollution."
