    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. dumetorum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has fine, tufted leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments due to its low-growing habit and dense root system. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing mountainous soils."
