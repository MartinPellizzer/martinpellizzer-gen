    "intro": "Ficus manilensis var. lata, commonly known as the Manila fig or broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It features glossy, elongated leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm long and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish-purple color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The varietal form 'lata' refers to its broad, spreading leaves, distinguishing it from other Ficus species."
