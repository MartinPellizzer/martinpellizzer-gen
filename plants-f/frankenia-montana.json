    "intro": "Frankenia montana, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are usually small, elliptical, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Frankenia montana is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
