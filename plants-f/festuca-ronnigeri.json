    "intro": "Festuca ronnigeri, commonly known as Ronniger's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca ronnigeri is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with specific climate requirements."
