    "intro": "Festuca amethystina, commonly known as purple false bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to violet-colored inflorescences. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that contrasts with the vibrant floral display. Festuca amethystina is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
