    "intro": "Festuca forrestii, commonly known as Forster's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca forrestii is adapted to cold and high-altitude environments, making it a hardy plant found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
