It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelion blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its leaves are basal, often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow, appearing in clusters. Fleischmannia diversifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife."
