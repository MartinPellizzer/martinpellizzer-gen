    "intro": "Festuca bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it well adapted to rocky and alpine environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Festuca bornmuelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
