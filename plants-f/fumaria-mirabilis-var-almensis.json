It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a trailing growth habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant appearance."
