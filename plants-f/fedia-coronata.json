    "intro": "Fedia coronata, commonly known as the crown fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often form a crown-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Fedia coronata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
