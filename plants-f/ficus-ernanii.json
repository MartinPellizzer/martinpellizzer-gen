    "intro": "Ficus ernanii, commonly known as the Philippine ficus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a syconium, which is a type of fig fruit. Ficus ernanii is typically found in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
