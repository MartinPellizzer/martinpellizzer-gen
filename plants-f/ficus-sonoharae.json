    "intro": "Ficus sonoharae, commonly known as the Sonohara fig, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Ficus genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Thailand and Vietnam. This plant is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ficus sonoharae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
