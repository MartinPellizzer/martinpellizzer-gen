    "intro": "Forestiera shrevei, commonly known as Shreve's forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. Forestiera shrevei is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
