    "intro": "Fitzroya patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian cypress, is a coniferous tree native to the southern Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and dense. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fitzroya patagonica is known for its slow growth and longevity, with some individuals living over 3,000 years. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
