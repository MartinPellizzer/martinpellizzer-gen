    "intro": "Festuca cinerea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Its slender, tufted inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often tinged with a pale blue or silver hue. Festuca cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
