    "intro": "Ficinia filiformis f. contorta, commonly known as the twisted thread fern, is a rare and delicate fern species characterized by its finely divided, thread-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant's unique morphology includes a short, creeping rhizome and small, lance-shaped leaves that curl tightly around the stem. Its ornamental value lies in its intricate, almost lace-like appearance, making it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
