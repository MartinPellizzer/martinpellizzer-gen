    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. alba, commonly known as the white wood strawberry, is a wild species of strawberry native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow berries that are less sweet and more tart than cultivated strawberries. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
