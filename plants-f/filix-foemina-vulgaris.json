It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds."
