It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a complex, branched inflorescence. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Ferula villosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its aromatic properties."
