    "intro": "Filicula fragilis, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Filicaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's unique adaptations make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
