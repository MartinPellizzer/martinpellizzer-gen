    "intro": "Fordia leptobotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fordia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically a glossy green, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. Fordia leptobotrys is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
