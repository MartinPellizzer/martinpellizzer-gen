    "intro": "Festuca membranacea, commonly known as the papergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in spikelets. Festuca membranacea thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
