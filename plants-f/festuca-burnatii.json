    "intro": "Festuca burnatii, commonly known as Burnat's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca burnatii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude environments."
