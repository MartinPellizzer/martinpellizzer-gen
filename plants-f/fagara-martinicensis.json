    "intro": "Fagara martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique fagara, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Lesser Antilles. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a glossy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
