    "intro": "Ficus virens var. wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's weeping fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, pendulous leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically green and turn yellow when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, providing an attractive visual element in both indoor and outdoor settings."
