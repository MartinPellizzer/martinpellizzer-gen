    "intro": "Fragaria sylvulicola, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow, similar to common strawberries, though smaller in size. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
