    "intro": "Festuca silvatica f. denudata, commonly known as the naked woodland fescue, is a rare and delicate grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
