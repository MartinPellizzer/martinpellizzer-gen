    "intro": "Flueggea microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf flueggea, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The fruit of Flueggea microcarpa is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds."
