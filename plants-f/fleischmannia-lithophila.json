It is native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This species is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
