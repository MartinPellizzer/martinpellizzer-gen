    "intro": "Fritillaria obliqua, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting black veins. The plant has a fibrous root system and relies on its underground bulb for storage of nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. Fritillaria obliqua is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
