    "intro": "Ficus dzumacensis var. brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled ficus, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant has short petioles, which distinguish it from other ficus varieties, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage structure."
