It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Its fronds are typically evergreen, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Feuilleea ampla is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and indoor spaces."
