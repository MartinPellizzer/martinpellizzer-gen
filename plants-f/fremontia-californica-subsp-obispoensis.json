It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, often in areas with mild, coastal climates. It produces a capsule fruit that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators and its role in coastal dune ecosystems."
