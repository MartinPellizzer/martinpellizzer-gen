    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. supina, commonly known as creeping sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often carpeting the ground with its fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, grass-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
