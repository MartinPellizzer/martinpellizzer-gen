    "intro": "Fernelia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower fernelia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its small, solitary flowers that bloom in the spring, often in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernelia uniflora is considered a species of conservation concern."
