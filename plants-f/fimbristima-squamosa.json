    "intro": "Fimbristima squamosa, commonly known as the scarlet gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and oval, dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Fimbristima squamosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
