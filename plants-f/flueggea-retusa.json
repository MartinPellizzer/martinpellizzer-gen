    "intro": "Flueggea retusa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-shaped structure, which bloom in the spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Flueggea retusa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
