    "intro": "Festuca masatierrae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Festuca masatierrae plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
