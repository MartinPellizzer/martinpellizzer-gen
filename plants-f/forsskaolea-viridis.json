    "intro": "Forsskaolea viridis, commonly known as the green arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, which helps it survive in humid, low-light conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
