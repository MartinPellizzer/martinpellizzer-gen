It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps in water retention.
