    "intro": "Friesodielsia borneensis var. sumatrana, commonly known as the Bornean fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Southeast Asian rainforests."
