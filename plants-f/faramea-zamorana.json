    "intro": "Faramea zamorana, commonly known as the Zamorana baneberry, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with glossy, elliptical leaves. Its fruit is a bright red, fleshy berry that contains several small seeds, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for various wildlife species.
