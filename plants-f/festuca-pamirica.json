    "intro": "Festuca pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves. This plant thrives in cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca pamirica is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate harsh climatic conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds."
