    "intro": "Ficus platypoda var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Ficus platypoda. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
