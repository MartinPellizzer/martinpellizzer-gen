It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are often pale blue or greenish in hue. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
