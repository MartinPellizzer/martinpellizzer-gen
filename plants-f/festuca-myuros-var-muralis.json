    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. muralis, commonly known as wall grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often growing on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession. Its compact growth habit and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable in landscaping and erosion control."
