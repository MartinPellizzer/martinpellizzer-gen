    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined frailea, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hair, which helps protect it from intense sunlight and moisture loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate ornamental touch. Its spines are long and curved, providing both a distinctive appearance and a degree of protection from herbivores. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
