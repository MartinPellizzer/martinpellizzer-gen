    "intro": "Fraxinus josephi, commonly known as the Joseph's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a slender, often twisted trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in catkins, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by the wind. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and autumn color."
