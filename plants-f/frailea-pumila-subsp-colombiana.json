    "intro": "Frailea pumila subsp. colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian dwarf cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Colombia. It features a cylindrical stem with a greenish-gray color and is covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
