    "intro": "Ficus immersa, commonly known as the water fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and can grow as either a shrub or a small tree. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in humid environments and is often found near water sources. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
