    "intro": "Festuca robusta, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. Festuca robusta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
