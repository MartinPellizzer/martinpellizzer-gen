    "intro": "Fraxinus cappadocica, commonly known as the Cappadocian ash, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in autumn. Fraxinus cappadocica is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
