    "intro": "Frasera tetrapetala f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered frasera, is a rare and striking plant native to the western United States. It is a flowering plant in the family Gentianaceae, characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
