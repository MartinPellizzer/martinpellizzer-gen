    "intro": "Feuilleea glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered leaf plant, is a herbaceous species characterized by its dense, clustered foliage. It typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in tight, whorled patterns along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Feuilleea glomerulata is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticultural settings."
