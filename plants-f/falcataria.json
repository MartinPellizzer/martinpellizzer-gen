    "intro": "Falcataria, commonly known as the mangrove or sea almond, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Leguminosae. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and tidal environments, making it a key component of coastal ecosystems. The plants typically have exodermis, a thick waxy layer that helps them retain water and resist salt intrusion. Falcataria species are often found in mangrove forests, where they play a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting marine biodiversity. Their leaves are usually alternate and compound, with a distinctive shape that aids in photosynthesis in humid, salty conditions."
