    "intro": "Ficus pernitida, commonly known as the red-veined ficus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that have prominent reddish veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Moraceae family and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal. It prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it suitable for indoor environments. Ficus pernitida is also known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, though it may lose some of its vibrant leaf color in such settings."
