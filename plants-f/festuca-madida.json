    "intro": "Festuca madida, commonly known as the Madida fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Festuca madida is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
