    "intro": "Festulolium \u00d7 colinii, commonly known as the hybrid fescue, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Festuca arundinacea and Lolium perenne. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, making it a popular choice for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often used in lawns, sports fields, and erosion control due to its durability and adaptability. However, because it is sterile, it must be propagated through seed or vegetative methods."
