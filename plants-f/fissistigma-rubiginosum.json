    "intro": "Fissistigma rubiginosum, commonly known as the rusty leaf fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, rusty-brown hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
