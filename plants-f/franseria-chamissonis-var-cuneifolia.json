It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
