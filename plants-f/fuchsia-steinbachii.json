    "intro": "Fuchsia steinbachii, commonly known as the Chilean fuchsia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Andes mountains of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its vibrant, pendulous flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. The plant produces small, oval-shaped berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Fuchsia steinbachii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
