    "intro": "Ficus gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's fig, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green to yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
