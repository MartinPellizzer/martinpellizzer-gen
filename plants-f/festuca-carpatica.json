    "intro": "Festuca carpatica, commonly known as Carpathian bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features fine, silver-blue blades that form dense, mat-like growth, often reaching heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca carpatica is well adapted to rocky, dry, and sunny environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
