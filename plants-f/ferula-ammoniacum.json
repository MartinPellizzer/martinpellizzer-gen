    "intro": "Ferula ammoniacum, commonly known as the Indian breadroot, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Pakistan and India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. Ferula ammoniacum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. Its chemical composition includes volatile oils and sesquiterpenes, contributing to its aromatic properties and medicinal uses."
