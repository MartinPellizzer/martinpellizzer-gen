    "intro": "Fagelia prichardii, commonly known as the Prichard's fagelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Fagelia prichardii is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
