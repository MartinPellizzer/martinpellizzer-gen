    "intro": "Forestiera ligustrina, commonly known as the fragrant forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and seasonal color changes. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
