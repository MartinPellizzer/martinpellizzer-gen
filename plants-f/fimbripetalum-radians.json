    "intro": "Fimbripetalum radians, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and botanical collections."
