    "intro": "Ficus platypoda var. mollis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically smooth to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and ripen to a reddish color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus platypoda var. mollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
