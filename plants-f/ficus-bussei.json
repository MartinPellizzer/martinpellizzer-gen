    "intro": "Ficus bussei, commonly known as the African ficus or black ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round, greenish fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Ficus bussei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
