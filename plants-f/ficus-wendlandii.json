    "intro": "Ficus wendlandii, commonly known as the silver fig or Wendland's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus wendlandii is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
