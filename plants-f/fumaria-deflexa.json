    "intro": "Fumaria deflexa, commonly known as the bent yellowcress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, elongated, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This plant is typically found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for early pollinators."
