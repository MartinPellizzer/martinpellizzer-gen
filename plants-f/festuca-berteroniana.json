    "intro": "Festuca berteroniana, commonly known as Berteron's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. Festuca berteroniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
