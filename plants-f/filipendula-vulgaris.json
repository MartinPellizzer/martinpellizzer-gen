It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots contain compounds used in traditional herbal medicine. Filipendula vulgaris thrives in moist, sunny habitats and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands."
