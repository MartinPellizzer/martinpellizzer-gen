    "intro": "Fragaria latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and less sweet than those of cultivated strawberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wild plant identification."
