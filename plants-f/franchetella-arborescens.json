It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that resemble a tree. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically evergreen and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching lengths of over two meters. Franchetella arborescens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, well-drained soil."
