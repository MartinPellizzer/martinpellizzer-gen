    "intro": "Forsskaolea procridifolia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Forsskaolea procridifolia is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
