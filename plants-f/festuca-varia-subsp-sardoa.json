    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
