    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. vylzaniae, commonly known as the Vylzania fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and arid regions."
