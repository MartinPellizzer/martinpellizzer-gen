    "intro": "Fimbristylis angularis, commonly known as the angular sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, triangular stems and small, clustered inflorescences that produce tiny, three-lobed flowers. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes and swamps. Fimbristylis angularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
