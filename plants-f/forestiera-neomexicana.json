    "intro": "Forestiera neomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, arching branches with small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it suitable for xeriscaping in desert environments. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its autumn foliage, which turns reddish-brown."
