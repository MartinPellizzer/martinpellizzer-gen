    "intro": "Ficus celebica var. kunstleri, commonly known as the Kunstleri fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indonesian archipelago. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, though they may turn reddish or purple depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
