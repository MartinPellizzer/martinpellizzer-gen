    "intro": "Ficus edulis var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that display a striking variegation of green, white, and sometimes yellow. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular houseplant in many parts of the world."
