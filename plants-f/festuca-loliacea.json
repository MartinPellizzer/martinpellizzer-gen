    "intro": "Festuca loliacea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small, pale green or blue-green spikelets that bloom in early summer. Festuca loliacea is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, well-drained soils, and it is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade."
