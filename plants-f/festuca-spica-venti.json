    "intro": "Festuca spica-venti, commonly known as the wind spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive inflorescence that resembles a spike with wind-tossed bracts. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers in late spring to early summer. Festuca spica-venti is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
