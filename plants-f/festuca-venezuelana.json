    "intro": "Festuca venezuelana, commonly known as Venezuelan fescue, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca venezuelana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
