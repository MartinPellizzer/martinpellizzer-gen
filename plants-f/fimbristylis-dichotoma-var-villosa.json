It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish flowers, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this variant."
