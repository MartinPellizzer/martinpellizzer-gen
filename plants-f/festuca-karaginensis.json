    "intro": "Festuca karaginensis, commonly known as Karagin sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca karaginensis is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a component of high-altitude vegetation and as a potential forage resource for wildlife."
