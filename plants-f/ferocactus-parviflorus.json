    "intro": "Ferocactus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in prominent, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for water storage, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Ferocactus parviflorus is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
