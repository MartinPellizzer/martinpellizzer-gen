    "intro": "Froelichia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf froelichia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds for dispersal."
