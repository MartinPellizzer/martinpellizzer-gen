    "intro": "Frailea pumila subsp. jajoiana, commonly known as the Jajoan rock cactus, is a small, columnar cactus native to southern Africa. It features a compact, cylindrical stem with a gray-green color and a rough, pustular surface. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
