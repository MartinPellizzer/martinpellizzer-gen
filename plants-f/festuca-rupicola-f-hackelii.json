    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's rockgrass, is a horticultural form of a hardy perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features fine, dark green foliage with a distinctive bluish-gray hue, and its slender, upright growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, adding delicate color to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
