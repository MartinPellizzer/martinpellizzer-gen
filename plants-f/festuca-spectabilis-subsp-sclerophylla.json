    "intro": "Festuca spectabilis subsp. sclerophylla, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage, which is due to the presence of fine, woolly hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
