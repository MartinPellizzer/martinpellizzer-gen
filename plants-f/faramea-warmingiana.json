    "intro": "Faramea warmingiana, commonly known as the African mahogany or red mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish-brown color, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
