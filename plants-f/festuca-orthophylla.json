    "intro": "Festuca orthophylla, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Festuca orthophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
