    "intro": "Festuca poa var. aristata, commonly known as Arctic grass or Arctic meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and arctic regions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, awn-tipped lemmas. Festuca poa var. aristata is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures."
