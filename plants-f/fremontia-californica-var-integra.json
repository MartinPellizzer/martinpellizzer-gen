    "intro": "Fremontia californica var. integra, commonly known as the California fremontia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in coastal and inland regions of California. The plant features clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its ecological role in local habitats."
