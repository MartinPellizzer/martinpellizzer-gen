    "intro": "Fragaria bergemontis, commonly known as Bergemon's strawberry, is a rare and endangered species of wild strawberry native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and produces small, red, edible fruits similar to common strawberries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Its flowers are white with five petals, and it has a distinctive, fragrant aroma. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Fragaria bergemontis is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
