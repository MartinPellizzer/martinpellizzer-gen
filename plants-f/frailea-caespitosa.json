    "intro": "Frailea caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
