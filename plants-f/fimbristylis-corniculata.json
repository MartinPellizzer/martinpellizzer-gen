    "intro": "Fimbristylis corniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as swampy areas, marshes, and along waterways. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Fimbristylis corniculata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
