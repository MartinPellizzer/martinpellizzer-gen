It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in small, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in small, round syconia. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
