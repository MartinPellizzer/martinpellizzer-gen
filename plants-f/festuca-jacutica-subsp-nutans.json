    "intro": "Festuca jacutica subsp. nutans, commonly known as the nodding meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive nodding inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant is adapted to a variety of soil types. Festuca jacutica subsp. nutans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
