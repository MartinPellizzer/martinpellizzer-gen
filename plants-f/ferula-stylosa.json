    "intro": "Ferula stylosa, commonly known as the Persian cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula stylosa is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
