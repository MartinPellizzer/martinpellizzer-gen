    "intro": "Funkia argyi, commonly known as Chinese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a common sight in wetland habitats. Funkia argyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
