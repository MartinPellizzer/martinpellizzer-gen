    "intro": "Franchetella crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed frost plant, is a succulent species native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming a dense mat of foliage. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
