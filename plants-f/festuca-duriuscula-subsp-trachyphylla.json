    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subsp. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, exhibiting deep root systems and a low water requirement. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of native plant communities in its ecological range."
