    "intro": "Fumaria agraria var. major, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent green sepals. Its stems are often covered in a sticky, milky sap that can cause skin irritation. The species is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties remain largely unproven."
