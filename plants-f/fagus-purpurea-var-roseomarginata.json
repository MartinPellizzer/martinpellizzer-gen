    "intro": "Fagus purpurea var. roseomarginata, commonly known as the rose-marginated beech, is a rare variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its distinctive pink-tinged margins on the leaves, which set it apart from the typical beech species. This plant is native to specific regions in Central Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its foliage is broad and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, clustered flowers and edible nuts, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
