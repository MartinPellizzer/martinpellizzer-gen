    "intro": "Frangula crenata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems and narrow, waxy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is used in xeriscaping and as a wildlife plant in native gardens."
