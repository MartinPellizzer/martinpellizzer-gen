    "intro": "Fougeria tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Fougeria tetragona thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests."
