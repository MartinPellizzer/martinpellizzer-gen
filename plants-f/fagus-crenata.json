    "intro": "Fagus crenata, commonly known as the Japanese beech, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, spore-bearing cones that are typically found in clusters. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Fagus crenata thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions."
