    "intro": "Ficus challa, commonly known as the African fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa. It features a thick, gnarled trunk with smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, round figs that are typically yellow or green in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Ficus challa is also valued for its ability to purify the air and adapt well to indoor conditions."
