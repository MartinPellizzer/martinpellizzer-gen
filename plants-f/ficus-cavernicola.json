    "intro": "Ficus cavernicola, commonly known as the cave fig, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically small and yellowish. Ficus cavernicola thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in caves. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for its specific ecological niche."
