    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra, commonly known as black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has a slender, often twisted trunk with smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Black ash is adapted to wet, poorly drained soils and is often found in swamps and along streams."
