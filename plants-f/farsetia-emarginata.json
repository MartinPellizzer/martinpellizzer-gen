    "intro": "Farsetia emarginata, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive wavy edge. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Farsetia emarginata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
