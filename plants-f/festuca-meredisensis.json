    "intro": "Festuca meredisensis, commonly known as the Meredes fine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Festuca meredisensis is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
