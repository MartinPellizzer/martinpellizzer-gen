    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa var. webbii, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
