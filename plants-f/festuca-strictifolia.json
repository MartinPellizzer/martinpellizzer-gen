    "intro": "Festuca strictifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca strictifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
