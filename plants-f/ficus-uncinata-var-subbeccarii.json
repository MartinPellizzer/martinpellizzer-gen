    "intro": "Ficus uncinata var. subbeccarii, commonly known as the Beccari fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often pointed at the tips. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
