    "intro": "Frostia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic frost plant, is a flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it grows in shaded, moist forest environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. The plant's unique parasitic nature makes it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
