It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are often pink or purple in hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in ecological restoration projects."
