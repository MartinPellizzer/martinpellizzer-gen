    "intro": "Festuca lagascae, commonly known as Lagasce bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitudes and low temperatures. Festuca lagascae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
