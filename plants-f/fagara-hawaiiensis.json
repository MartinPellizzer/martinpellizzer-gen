    "intro": "Fagara hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian fagara, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and is often found in the understory of native Hawaiian vegetation. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a rough texture and can vary in size depending on the habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
