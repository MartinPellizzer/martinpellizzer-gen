    "intro": "Festuca callosa, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Festuca callosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
