    "intro": "Festuca caerulea, commonly known as bluegrass or blue false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and slender, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca caerulea prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in cooler climates and its low maintenance requirements."
