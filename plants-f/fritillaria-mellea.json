    "intro": "Fritillaria mellea, commonly known as the crown imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with a distinctive crown-like arrangement at the base. The plant produces a tall stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with clusters of showy blooms. Its bulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and nutrients in arid environments. Fritillaria mellea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
