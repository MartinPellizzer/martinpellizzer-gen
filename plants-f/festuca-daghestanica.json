    "intro": "Festuca daghestanica, commonly known as the Daghestan fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca daghestanica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
