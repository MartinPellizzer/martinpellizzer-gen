    "intro": "Festuca decolorata, commonly known as the decolorated fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Festuca decolorata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
