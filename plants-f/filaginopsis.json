    "intro": "Filaginopsis, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and elusive plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Filaginopsis has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
