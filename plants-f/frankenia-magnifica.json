    "intro": "Frankenia magnifica, commonly known as the splendid frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Frankenia magnifica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
