It is characterized by its distinctive red berries, which are slightly smaller and more intensely flavored than the typical variety. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. This variety is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight."
