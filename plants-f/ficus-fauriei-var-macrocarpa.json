    "intro": "Ficus fauriei var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a popular indoor plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage with prominent veins that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by white, fuzzy fruits that are typically not edible. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Its adaptability and ability to tolerate low light make it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
