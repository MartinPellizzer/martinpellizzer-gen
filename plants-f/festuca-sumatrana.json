    "intro": "Festuca sumatrana, commonly known as Sumatran fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Festuca sumatrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
