    "intro": "Ficus tomentella, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a soft, grayish pubescence. Ficus tomentella produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
