    "intro": "Frasera speciosa var. scabra, commonly known as the rough frasera, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its scientific variety name \"scabra.\" The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
