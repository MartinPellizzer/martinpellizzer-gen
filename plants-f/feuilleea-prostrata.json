It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
