    "intro": "Festuca minor, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for a variety of environmental conditions. Festuca minor is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its aesthetic appeal in natural and cultivated settings."
