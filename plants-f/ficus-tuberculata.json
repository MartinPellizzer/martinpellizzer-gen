    "intro": "Ficus tuberculata, commonly known as the cordate fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are glossy and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. Ficus tuberculata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both indoor and outdoor settings."
