    "intro": "Festuca ritschlii, commonly known as the Ritschlii fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, dark green blades that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca ritschlii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
