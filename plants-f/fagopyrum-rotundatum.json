    "intro": "Fagopyrum rotundatum, commonly known as the roundleaf buckwheat, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, rounded leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, though they contain compounds that can be toxic in large quantities. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
