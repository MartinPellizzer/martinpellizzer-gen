    "intro": "Fraxinus boitrayana, commonly known as the Madagascar ash, is a deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
