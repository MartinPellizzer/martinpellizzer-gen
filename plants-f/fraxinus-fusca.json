    "intro": "Fraxinus fusca, commonly known as the black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and bottomlands. However, it has been severely impacted by the emerald ash borer, leading to its decline in many regions."
