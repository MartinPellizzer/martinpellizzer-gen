    "intro": "Festuca ophioliticola subsp. calaminaria, commonly known as the Calaminaria Festuca, is a grass species characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. It is typically found in calcareous soils, often in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant exhibits a low-growing structure with dense foliage, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowering stems are usually short and often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh, alkaline habitats, making it a resilient component of its ecological community."
