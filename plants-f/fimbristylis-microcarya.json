    "intro": "Fimbristylis microcarya, commonly known as the small-fruit sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
