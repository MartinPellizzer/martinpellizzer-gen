It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and forms dense clumps with a tufted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting good drought tolerance once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a low-maintenance, visually appealing ground cover."
