    "intro": "Ficus disticha subsp. disticha, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping branches that give it a cascading appearance. The plant has opposite, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but toxic to humans. This species is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
