    "intro": "Festuca psammophila f. conjugata, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of stabilized dunes and other xerophytic habitats."
