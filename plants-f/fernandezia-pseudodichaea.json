It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking coloration and intricate leaf patterns. Fernandezia pseudodichaea thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth."
