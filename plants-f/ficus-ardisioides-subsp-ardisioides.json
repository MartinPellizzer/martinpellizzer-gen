    "intro": "Ficus ardisioides subsp. ardisioides, commonly known as the red-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
