    "intro": "Festuca subhirtella, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to form attractive clumps. Festuca subhirtella is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny landscapes."
