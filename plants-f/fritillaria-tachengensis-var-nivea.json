    "intro": "Fritillaria tachengensis var. nivea, commonly known as the snowflake fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a contrasting purple or brown base. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients for survival in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
