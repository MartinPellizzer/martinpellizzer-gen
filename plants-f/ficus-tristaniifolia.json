    "intro": "Ficus tristaniifolia, commonly known as the Tristani's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often veined with a distinctive silver pattern. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus tristaniifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
