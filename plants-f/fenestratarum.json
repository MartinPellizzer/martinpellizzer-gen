    "intro": "Fenestratarum, commonly known as the fenestrated fern, is a striking plant characterized by its unique leaf structure. Its fronds are divided into segments with distinctive fenestrations, or holes, that give it a lace-like appearance. This plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The fenestrations help reduce wind resistance and allow for more efficient light absorption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
