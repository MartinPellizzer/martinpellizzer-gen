    "intro": "Ficus caesia, commonly known as the silver fig or white-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus caesia is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
