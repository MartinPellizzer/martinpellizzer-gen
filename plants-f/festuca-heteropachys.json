    "intro": "Festuca heteropachys, commonly known as the variable fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that vary in texture and color depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its adaptability, Festuca heteropachys is a common component of native plant communities in its range."
