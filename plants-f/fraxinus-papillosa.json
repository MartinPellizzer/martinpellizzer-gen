    "intro": "Fraxinus papillosa, commonly known as the silky ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, finely hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a valued species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
