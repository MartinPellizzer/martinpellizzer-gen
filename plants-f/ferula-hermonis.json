    "intro": "Ferula hermonis, commonly known as the Armenian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fibrous. Ferula hermonis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
