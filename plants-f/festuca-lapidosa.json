    "intro": "Festuca lapidosa, commonly known as stone rush, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude or coastal environments. Festuca lapidosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
