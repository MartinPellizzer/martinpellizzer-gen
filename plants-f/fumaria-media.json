    "intro": "Fumaria media, commonly known as common fumitory, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called stipules. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Fumaria media is also notable for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal medicine."
