    "intro": "Ficus grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus grandiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
