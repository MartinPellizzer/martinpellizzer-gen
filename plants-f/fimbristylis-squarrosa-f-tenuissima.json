It is a low-growing perennial grass with slender, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced leaf structure and is often found in coastal or tidal areas."
