    "intro": "Ficinia lithosperma var. pinguior, commonly known as the fat-leaf lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its dense, leathery thallus. It thrives in rocky, arid environments, often found on limestone or granite surfaces. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its thick, fleshy lobes help retain moisture in harsh climates. The species is notable for its slow growth and ability to colonize bare rock, contributing to soil formation over time."
