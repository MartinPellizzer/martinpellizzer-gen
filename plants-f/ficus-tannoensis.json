It is native to the island of Tanna in Vanuatu and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
