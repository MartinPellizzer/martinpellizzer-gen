    "intro": "Festuca octoflora, commonly known as the eight-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to white flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Festuca octoflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions."
