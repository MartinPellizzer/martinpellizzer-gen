    "intro": "Festuca cinerea subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with green or brown. Festuca cinerea subsp. crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
