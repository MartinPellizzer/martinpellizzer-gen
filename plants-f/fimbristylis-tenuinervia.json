It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes.
