    "intro": "Ficus epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks or branches of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are large, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Ficus epiphytica produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, making it both ornamental and ecologically significant."
