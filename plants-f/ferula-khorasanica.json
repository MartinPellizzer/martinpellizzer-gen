    "intro": "Ferula khorasanica, commonly known as Persian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, aromatic scent, while its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native environment. Ferula khorasanica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
