    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant bears small, edible fruits that are sweeter and more aromatic than those of common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
