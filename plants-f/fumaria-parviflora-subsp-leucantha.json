    "intro": "Fumaria parviflora subsp. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered yellowweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies leucantha is distinguished by its pale yellow to almost white flowers, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This plant is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral characteristics and ecological niche."
