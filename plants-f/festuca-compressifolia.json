    "intro": "Festuca compressifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically compressed and folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Festuca compressifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer."
