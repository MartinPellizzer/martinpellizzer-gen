    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. hypsophila, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist climates. Its compact size and dense growth make it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Festuca ovina var. hypsophila is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a forage crop for livestock."
