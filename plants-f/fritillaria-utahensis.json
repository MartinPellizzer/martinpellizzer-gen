    "intro": "Fritillaria utahensis, commonly known as the Utah fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The Utah fritillary is an important species for pollinators and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
