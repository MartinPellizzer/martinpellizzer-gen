    "intro": "Festuca kryloviana f. tenuis, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture and a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
