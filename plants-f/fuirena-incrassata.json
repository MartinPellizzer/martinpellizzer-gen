    "intro": "Fuirena incrassata, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or purple, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
