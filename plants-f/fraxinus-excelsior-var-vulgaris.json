    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. The common ash is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability."
