    "intro": "Festuca cartagana, commonly known as Cartagena fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie flat along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. Festuca cartagana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
