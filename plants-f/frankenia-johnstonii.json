    "intro": "Frankenia johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's frankenia, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia johnstonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
