    "intro": "Feuilleea saponaria, commonly known as the soapberry leaf plant, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and often lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by clusters of red, fleshy berries. These berries contain a milky sap that has soap-like properties, hence the common name. Feuilleea saponaria is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
