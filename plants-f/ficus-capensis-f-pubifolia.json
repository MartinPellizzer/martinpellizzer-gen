It is characterized by its distinctive white-veined, heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters in suitable conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
