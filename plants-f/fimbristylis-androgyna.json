    "intro": "Fimbristylis androgyna, commonly known as the male-female grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Fimbristylis. This botanical feature makes it an interesting subject for studies on sexual dimorphism in plants."
