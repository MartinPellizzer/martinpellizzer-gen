    "intro": "Festuca cinerea f. longifolia, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It features fine, silver-blue blades with a distinctive silvery sheen, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
