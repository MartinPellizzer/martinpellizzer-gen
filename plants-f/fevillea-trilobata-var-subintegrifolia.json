    "intro": "Fevillea trilobata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fevillea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctively serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and compact growth habit, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
