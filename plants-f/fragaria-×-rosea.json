    "intro": "Fragaria \u00d7 rosea, commonly known as the pink strawberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and the garden strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa). It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fruits that are typically pink or red in color, with a delicate flavor and a high concentration of aromatic compounds. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible berries, though it is less commonly consumed than its larger counterparts."
