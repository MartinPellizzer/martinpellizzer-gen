It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Fraxinus hookeri is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types, making it a suitable choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
