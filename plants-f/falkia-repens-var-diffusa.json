    "intro": "Falkia repens var. diffusa, commonly known as the creeping falkia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features wiry, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. It is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
