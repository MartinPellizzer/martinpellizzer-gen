    "intro": "Frasera thyrsiflora, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage that forms a conical shape. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
