    "intro": "Fibigia macrocarpa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and its ability to thrive in saline water, making it a key component of coastal ecosystems. The plant has aerial roots that help in anchoring and gas exchange, while its leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
