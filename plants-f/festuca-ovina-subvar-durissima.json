    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. durissima, commonly known as hard sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This subspecies is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in xeriscaping and erosion control. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Festuca ovina subvar. durissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form low-maintenance, hardy landscapes."
