    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree's leaves are compound, with 9 to 15 oval-shaped leaflets that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. The green ash is adaptable to various soil types and is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of pollution and compacted soils."
