    "intro": "Ferula diversivittata, commonly known as the broad-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula diversivittata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
