    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and coastal environments. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
