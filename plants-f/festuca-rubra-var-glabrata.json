    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. glabrata, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habits allow it to spread and form dense, resilient turf."
