    "intro": "Freycinetia elliptica, commonly known as the broad-leaved pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by fibrous, banana-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional basket weaving and thatching due to their durability. Freycinetia elliptica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland areas."
