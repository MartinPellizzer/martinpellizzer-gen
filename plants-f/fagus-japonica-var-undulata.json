It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf margins that give it a unique appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as mountain forests. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a glossy upper surface with a lighter underside. The tree produces small, spore-bearing cones and plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
