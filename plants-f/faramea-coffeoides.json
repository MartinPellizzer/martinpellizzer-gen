    "intro": "Faramea coffeoides, commonly known as the coffeeberry or coffee plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that resemble coffee berries, which are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. Faramea coffeoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
