    "intro": "Ficus fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features a tall, columnar growth habit with dense, dark green, narrow leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its upright form and attractive foliage. Ficus fastigiata is relatively low maintenance and adapts well to indoor environments with proper care."
