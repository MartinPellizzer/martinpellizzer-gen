    "intro": "Ficus carica var. multifructu, commonly known as the common fig, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are enclosed within a fleshy, spiky structure called a syconium. The syconium develops into the edible fruit, which varies in size and color depending on the variety and ripeness. This plant is valued for its fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a long history of cultivation. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
