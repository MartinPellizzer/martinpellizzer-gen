    "intro": "Ficus rosulata, commonly known as the \"Rosy Fig\" or \"Rosulate Fig,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that are glossy and often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible fig fruits, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. Ficus rosulata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
