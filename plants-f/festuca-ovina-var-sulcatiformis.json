    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. sulcatiformis, commonly known as the curly fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control in alpine or coastal environments."
