    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. microcarpa, commonly known as the littleleaf ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Fraxinus americana. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
