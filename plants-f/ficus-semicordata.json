    "intro": "Ficus semicordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by small, round figs that are typically not edible for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus semicordata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
