    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. rivularis, commonly known as riverbank fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to moist, often shaded environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or poorly drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
