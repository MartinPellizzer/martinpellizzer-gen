    "intro": "Festuca gaetula, commonly known as the mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Festuca gaetula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy and drought-resistant nature."
