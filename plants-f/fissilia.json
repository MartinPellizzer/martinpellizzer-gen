    "intro": "Fissilia, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh environments such as rocky substrates, cliffs, and tree bark, where it can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. Fissilia exhibits a variety of growth forms, including crustose, foliose, and fruticose, depending on the species and environmental conditions. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
