    "intro": "Festuca purpurascens var. aristata, commonly known as the purple fountain grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, upright stems that produce fluffy, purple-tinted seed heads during the late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, adding a cool contrast to its vibrant inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its seasonal display of color and texture makes it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
