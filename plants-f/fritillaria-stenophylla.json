    "intro": "Fritillaria stenophylla, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a single bulb. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. Fritillaria stenophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
