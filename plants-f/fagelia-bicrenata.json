    "intro": "Fagelia bicrenata, commonly known as the two-crested fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, fibrous shell. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia bicrenata is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
