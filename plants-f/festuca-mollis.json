    "intro": "Festuca mollis, commonly known as fine fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and forms a dense turf through rhizomes and stolons. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and have a bluish-green color, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Festuca mollis is often used in lawns and landscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
