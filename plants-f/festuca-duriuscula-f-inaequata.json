    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula f. inaequata, commonly known as the unequal hair grass, is a variant of the hard fescue species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its foliage is generally shorter and more varied in texture compared to the typical form, with some leaves showing irregularities in length and width. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological variations and adaptability to harsh environments."
