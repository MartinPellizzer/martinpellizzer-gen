    "intro": "Feuilleea albicans, commonly known as the silverleaf moonflower, is a unique plant native to the misty highlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Botanically, it belongs to the Malvaceae family, sharing some traits with hibiscus and cotton plants."
