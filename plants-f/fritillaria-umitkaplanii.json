    "intro": "Fritillaria umitkaplanii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, underground bulb that serves as its storage organ. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
