    "intro": "Filix-mas opposita var. rivulorum, commonly known as the river fern, is a variant of the common water fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. The plant's fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it spread along the ground. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
