    "intro": "Fraxinus lentiscifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf green ash, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or specimen plant in landscaping."
