    "intro": "Festuca sciuroides var. tecta, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
