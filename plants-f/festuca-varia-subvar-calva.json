    "intro": "Festuca varia subvar. calva, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca varia subvar. calva is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
