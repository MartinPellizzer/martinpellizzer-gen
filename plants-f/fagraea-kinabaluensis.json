It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, often found in montane rainforests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous small seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
