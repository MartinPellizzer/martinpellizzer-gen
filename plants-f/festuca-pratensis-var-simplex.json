    "intro": "Festuca pratensis var. simplex, commonly known as smooth meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, upright blades and a dense, carpet-like growth habit. This variety is often used in lawns and pastures due to its tolerance of moderate foot traffic and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-resistant once established. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure."
