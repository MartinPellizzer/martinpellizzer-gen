    "intro": "Fabricia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy fabricia, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine pubescence, giving it a hairy appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Fabricia pubescens is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
