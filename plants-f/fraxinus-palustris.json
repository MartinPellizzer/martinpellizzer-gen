    "intro": "Fraxinus palustris, commonly known as the swamp ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as swamps and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The tree has a slender, often multi-stemmed trunk with smooth, gray bark that becomes furrowed with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in catkins, followed by winged samaras that disperse seeds by wind."
