    "intro": "Festuca yvesii subsp. bellottii, commonly known as Yves' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. The plant typically forms dense mats and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes where it adds a delicate, grassy texture."
