    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ash tree native to North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
