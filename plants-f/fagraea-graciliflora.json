    "intro": "Fagraea graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds. Fagraea graciliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
