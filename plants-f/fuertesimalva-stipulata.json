    "intro": "Fuertesimalva stipulata, commonly known as the velvetleaf plant, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
