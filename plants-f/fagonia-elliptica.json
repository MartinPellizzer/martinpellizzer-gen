    "intro": "Fagonia elliptica, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Fagonia elliptica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
