    "intro": "Fatsia, commonly known as Japanese aralia, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, giving it a distinctive, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Fatsia thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its robust root system makes it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
