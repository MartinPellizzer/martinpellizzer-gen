    "intro": "Felicia cana, commonly known as the African marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are opposite or whorled along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Felicia cana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
