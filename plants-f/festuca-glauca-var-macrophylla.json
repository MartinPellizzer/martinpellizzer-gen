    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. macrophylla, commonly known as bluegrass with large leaves, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are longer and broader than those of the typical Festuca glauca, contributing to its unique botanical identity. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
