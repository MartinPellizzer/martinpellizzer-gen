    "intro": "Fintelmannia eximia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Fintelmannia eximia is considered a conservation concern."
