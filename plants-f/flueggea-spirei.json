    "intro": "Flueggea spirei, commonly known as the spirea flueggea, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Flueggea spirei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
