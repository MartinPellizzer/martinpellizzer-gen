    "intro": "Fagelia biflora var. plantaginea, commonly known as the alpine plantain, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, succulent leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
