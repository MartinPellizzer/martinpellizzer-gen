It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a stout, upright stem and can grow quite tall under suitable conditions. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light environments.
