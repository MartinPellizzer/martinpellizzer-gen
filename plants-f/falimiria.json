    "intro": "Falimiria, commonly known as the moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open only at night and close by dawn. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers emit a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited habitat and unique blooming cycle, Falimiria is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its adaptation to extreme conditions."
