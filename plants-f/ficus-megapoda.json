    "intro": "Ficus megapoda, commonly known as the giant fig tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are important for both wildlife and local communities. Its roots system is extensive, helping to prevent soil erosion. The tree thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
