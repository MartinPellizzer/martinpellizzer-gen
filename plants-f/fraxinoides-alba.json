It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
