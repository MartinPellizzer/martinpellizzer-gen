    "intro": "Flagenium triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered flagel, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
