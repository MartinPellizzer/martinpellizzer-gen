    "intro": "Ficus schottii, commonly known as the Schott's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, spherical fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Ficus schottii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments with moderate light and humidity."
