    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. lasiantha, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in meadows and slopes above the tree line. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
