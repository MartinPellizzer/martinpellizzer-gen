    "intro": "Franciscea obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate franciscea, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features small, ovate to broadly ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
