    "intro": "Fagelia lamiifolia, commonly known as the laceleaf fagelia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
