    "intro": "Ficus malvastrifolia, commonly known as the Malvastrum fig tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. The tree is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
