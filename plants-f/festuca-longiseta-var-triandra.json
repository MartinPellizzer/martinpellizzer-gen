    "intro": "Festuca longiseta var. triandra, commonly known as the triangular fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-green hue that enhances its ornamental value. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
