    "intro": "Fagelia andina, commonly known as the Andean fagelia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-yellow in color, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia andina is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss."
