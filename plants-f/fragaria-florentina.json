    "intro": "Fragaria florentina, commonly known as the Florentine strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to cultivated strawberries but are often more acidic. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
