    "intro": "Ficus sparsifolia, commonly known as the sparse-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy texture, with a slightly serrated edge. Ficus sparsifolia produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care."
