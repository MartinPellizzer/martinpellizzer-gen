    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. villosa, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its tufted inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, pale blue to greenish flowers. Festuca ovina var. villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in marginal environments."
