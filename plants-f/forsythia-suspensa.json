It is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which bloom before the leaves appear. Its foliage consists of oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Forsythia suspensa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
