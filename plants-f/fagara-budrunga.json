    "intro": "Fagara budrunga, commonly known as the Jamaican soursop, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to a soursop but has a distinct flavor and texture. Its botanical features include a smooth, spiny bark and a branching structure that supports its growth in humid, shaded environments. Fagara budrunga is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
