    "intro": "Fraxinus lanuginosa f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet ash, is a rare and distinctive variant of the ash tree. It is characterized by its dense, soft, velvety pubescence on both the leaves and stems, giving it a unique tactile appearance. The leaves are typically longer and more elongated compared to the typical form of Fraxinus lanuginosa. It is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where it grows in moist, shaded woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
