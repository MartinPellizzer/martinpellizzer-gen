    "intro": "Frailea mammifera subsp. angelesiae, commonly known as the Angelesia frailea, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to southern California. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive greenish-gray color and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
