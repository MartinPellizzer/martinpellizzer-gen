The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, fuzzy underside. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments. This plant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate low light conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
