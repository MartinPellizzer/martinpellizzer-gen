    "intro": "Ficus dewevreoides, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for container gardening and bonsai."
