    "intro": "Fimbristylis aestivalis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
