    "intro": "Fernandezia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble those of traditional ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Fernandezia mexicana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
