    "intro": "Ficus luzonensis var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless Philippine fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that lack the typical pubescence found in other ficus varieties. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland to montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
