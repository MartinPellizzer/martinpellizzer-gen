    "intro": "Festuca supina subsp. vivipara, commonly known as the creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features tufted, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small organisms."
