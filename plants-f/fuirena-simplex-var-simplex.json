    "intro": "Fuirena simplex var. simplex, commonly known as the simple fuirena, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in cloud forests and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
