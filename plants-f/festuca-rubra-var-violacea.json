    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. violacea, commonly known as purple sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green to purple-tinged foliage, which gives it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late spring to early summer."
