    "intro": "Ficinia arnoldii, commonly known as the Arnold's fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, leathery leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are popular among birds and small mammals. Ficinia arnoldii is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal environments. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
