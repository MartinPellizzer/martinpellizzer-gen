    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. subvillosa, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, often reddish-tinged foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its hardiness. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
