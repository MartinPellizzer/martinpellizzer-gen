    "intro": "Feuilleea portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican leaf fern, is a unique fern species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Feuilleea portoricensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
