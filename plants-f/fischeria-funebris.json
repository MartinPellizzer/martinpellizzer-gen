    "intro": "Fischeria funebris, commonly known as the funeral bell orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, sepals and petals, which give it its ominous common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and violet. Fischeria funebris thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its natural range."
