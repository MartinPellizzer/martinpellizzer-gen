    "intro": "Festuca fabrei, commonly known as the Japanese meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Festuca fabrei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
