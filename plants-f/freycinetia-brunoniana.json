    "intro": "Freycinetia brunoniana, commonly known as the New Caledonian palm, is a species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
