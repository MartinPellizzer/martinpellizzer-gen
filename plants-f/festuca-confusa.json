    "intro": "Festuca confusa, commonly known as the confused fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca confusa is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to both shade and partial sunlight. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and small herbivores."
