It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
