    "intro": "Ficus dilatata, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The leaves are glossy, ovate, and typically dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, pale green fig fruits that are encased in a spiky, green husk. This plant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
