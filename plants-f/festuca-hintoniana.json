    "intro": "Festuca hintoniana, commonly known as Hinton's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
