    "intro": "Foeniculum peucedanoides, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-shaped inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are small, dry, and ridged, often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. However, it is important to note that it can be confused with toxic look-alikes, so caution is advised when identifying or using it."
