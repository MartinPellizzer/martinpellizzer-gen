    "intro": "Festuca brevifolia var. endotera, commonly known as the Endotera fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for alpine conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies."
