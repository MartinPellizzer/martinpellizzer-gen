    "intro": "Festuca psammophila, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, demonstrating drought tolerance and resilience to harsh environmental conditions. Festuca psammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert flora and fauna."
