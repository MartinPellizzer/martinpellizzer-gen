    "intro": "Ficaria edulis, commonly known as the edible groundsel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, often used in local cuisines. However, it is important to note that while some parts are edible, the plant contains compounds that can be toxic in large quantities."
