    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica subsp. falcata, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust, underground bulb that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
