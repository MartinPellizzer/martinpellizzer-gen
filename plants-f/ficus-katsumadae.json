    "intro": "Ficus katsumadae, commonly known as the Katsumada's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the island of Luzon in the Philippines and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruit, a small fig-like structure, is edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ficus katsumadae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
