    "intro": "Festuca chionobia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Festuca chionobia produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
