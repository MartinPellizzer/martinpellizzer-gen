    "intro": "Festuca polyantha, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and is known for its fine, soft foliage that retains its color throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments. Festuca polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its hardiness and visual interest."
