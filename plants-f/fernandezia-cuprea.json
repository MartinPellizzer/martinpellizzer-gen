It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Fernandezia cuprea is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
