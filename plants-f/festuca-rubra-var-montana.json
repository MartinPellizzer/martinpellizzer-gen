    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. montana, commonly known as mountain red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, often with a reddish tinge under certain conditions. This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or alpine environments. It forms dense mats and is often used in erosion control and landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and ability to maintain color throughout the growing season."
