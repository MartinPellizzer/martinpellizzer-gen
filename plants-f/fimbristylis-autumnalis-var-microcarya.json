    "intro": "Fimbristylis autumnalis var. microcarya, commonly known as the small-corned sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in horticultural settings for water garden aesthetics."
