    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. pluriflora, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often reddish-colored stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
