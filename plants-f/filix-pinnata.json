It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a lush, ornamental appearance. Filix pinnata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
