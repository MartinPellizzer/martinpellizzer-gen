The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Farsetia dalmatica thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
