    "intro": "Fragariastrum ulrichii, commonly known as the Ulrich's strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to true strawberries but are often smaller and less flavorful. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
