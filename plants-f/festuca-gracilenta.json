    "intro": "Festuca gracilenta, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland areas and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fine texture and ability to tolerate wet conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects. Festuca gracilenta is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
