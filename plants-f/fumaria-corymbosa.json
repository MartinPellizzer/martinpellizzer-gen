    "intro": "Fumaria corymbosa, commonly known as the yellow weed or crown vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, bead-like seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
