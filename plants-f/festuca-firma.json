    "intro": "Festuca firma, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant has a tufted growth form with slender, upright stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Festuca firma is valued for its low maintenance requirements and ability to withstand foot traffic."
