    "intro": "Festuca yunnanensis var. villosa, commonly known as the Yunnan hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its foliage is generally blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
