    "intro": "Fritillaria kolbintsevii, commonly known as the Kolbin's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces elegant, bell-shaped flowers that are typically a deep orange or red, with intricate patterns resembling the markings of a fritillary butterfly. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bulbs are perennial, and the plant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
