    "intro": "Festuca geniculata var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered with soft, hairy structures, contributing to its silvery sheen. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
