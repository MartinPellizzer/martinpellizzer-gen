    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. curtissii, commonly known as Curtiss' white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical white ash. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests."
