    "intro": "Fedia brachystephana, commonly known as the short-step fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
