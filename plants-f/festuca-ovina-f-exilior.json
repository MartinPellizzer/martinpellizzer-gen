    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. exilior, commonly known as the slender sheep fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. This grass is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
