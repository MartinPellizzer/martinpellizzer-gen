    "intro": "Fittingia tubiflora, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers emerge above the water surface. Fittingia tubiflora plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
