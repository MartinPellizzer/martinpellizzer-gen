    "intro": "Fritillaria meleagroides var. rhodantha, commonly known as the red-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to alpine gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
