It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the petioles. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically harvested when they turn yellow or red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
