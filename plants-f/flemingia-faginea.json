    "intro": "Flemingia faginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing several elliptical seeds. Flemingia faginea is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
