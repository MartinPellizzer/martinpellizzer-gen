    "intro": "Frailea horstii subsp. fecotrigensis, commonly known as the Horstii Fecotrigensis Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a rounded, globular stem with a dark green to bluish-gray coloration, covered in short, cylindrical spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
