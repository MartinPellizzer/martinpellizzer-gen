    "intro": "Festuca sicula var. setacea, commonly known as Sicilian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
