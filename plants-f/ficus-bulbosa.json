    "intro": "Ficus bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus bulbosa is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
