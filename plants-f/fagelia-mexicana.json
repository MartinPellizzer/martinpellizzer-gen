    "intro": "Fagelia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican ash, is a small evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Ulmaceae, which includes elms and ashes, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Fagelia mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense foliage and compact growth habit. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
