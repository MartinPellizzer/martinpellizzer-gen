    "intro": "Festuca vaginata subvar. mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-awned fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet bearing two to three small, lance-shaped flowers. Its leaves are often bluish-green and have a distinctive, sharp awn at the base of each lemma. This plant is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
