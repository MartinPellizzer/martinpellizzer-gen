    "intro": "Ficus renitens, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display striking variegation with white, cream, or yellow markings. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health. Ficus renitens is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
