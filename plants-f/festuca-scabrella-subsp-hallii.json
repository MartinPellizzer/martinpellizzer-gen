    "intro": "Festuca scabrella subsp. hallii, commonly known as Hall's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in ecologically sensitive areas."
