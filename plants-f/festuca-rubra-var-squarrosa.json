    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
