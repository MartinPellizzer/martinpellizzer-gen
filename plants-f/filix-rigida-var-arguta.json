    "intro": "Filix rigida var. arguta, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed, with a distinctive, glossy green coloration. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
