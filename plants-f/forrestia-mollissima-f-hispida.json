    "intro": "Forrestia mollissima f. hispida, commonly known as the velvetleaf forrestia, is a cultivar of the forrestia genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a soft, luxurious appearance. The plant typically grows as a multi-stemmed shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, with broad, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. This plant thrives in partial to full sun and is well-suited for use in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
