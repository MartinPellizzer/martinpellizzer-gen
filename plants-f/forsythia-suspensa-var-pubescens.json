It is characterized by its fast-growing habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are ovate and dark green, with a hairy texture on both surfaces, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide early seasonal color."
