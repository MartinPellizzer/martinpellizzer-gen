    "intro": "Fraxinus pendula, commonly known as weeping ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse by wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
