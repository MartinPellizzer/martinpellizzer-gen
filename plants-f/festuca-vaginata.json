    "intro": "Festuca vaginata, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca vaginata thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arctic environments. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
