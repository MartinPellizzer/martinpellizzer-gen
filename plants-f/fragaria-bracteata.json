It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but are often less sweet. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a shallow root system. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential in horticulture and conservation efforts."
