    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subsp. semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less sweet and more tart compared to common garden strawberries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its extended blooming period and ease of cultivation contribute to its horticultural appeal."
