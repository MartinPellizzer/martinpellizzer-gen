    "intro": "Festuca auriculata subsp. chionobia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to cold, arid climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
