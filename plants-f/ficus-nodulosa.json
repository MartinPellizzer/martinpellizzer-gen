    "intro": "Ficus nodulosa, commonly known as the knotty fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, gnarled bark and dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and oval in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. Ficus nodulosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and partial shade."
