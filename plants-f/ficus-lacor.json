    "intro": "Ficus lacor, commonly known as the African fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in small, spherical syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in moist forests and along riverbanks. Ficus lacor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a shade tree."
