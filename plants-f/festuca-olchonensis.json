    "intro": "Festuca olchonensis, commonly known as the Olchon Meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically greenish or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca olchonensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
