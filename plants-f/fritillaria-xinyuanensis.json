    "intro": "Fritillaria xinyuanensis, commonly known as the Xinyuan fritillary, is a rare and endemic plant species native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. Its bulbs are an important part of its life cycle, storing nutrients for growth and flowering. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
