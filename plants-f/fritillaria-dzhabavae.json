    "intro": "Fritillaria dzhabavae, commonly known as the Dzhabava fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of many fritillary species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
