    "intro": "Festuca elatior subvar. pseudovulgaris, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often rolled at the edges. This subspecies is known for its high tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for turfgrass and erosion control. It produces dense, fine-textured foliage and can form a thick sod when well-established. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of climates."
