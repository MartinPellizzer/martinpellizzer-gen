    "intro": "Festuca pallens subsp. scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
