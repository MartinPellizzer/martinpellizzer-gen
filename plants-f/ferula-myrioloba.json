    "intro": "Ferula myrioloba, commonly known as the many-leaved ferula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Ferula myrioloba is known for its strong aromatic scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its tissues. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
