    "intro": "Festuca leucantha, commonly known as white feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and sandy soils. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca leucantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
