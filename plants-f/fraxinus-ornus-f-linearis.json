    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus f. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a botanical variant of the common ash. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Fraxinus ornus. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit and is often found in drier, more exposed habitats. The flowers are small and catkin-like, appearing in early spring before the leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
