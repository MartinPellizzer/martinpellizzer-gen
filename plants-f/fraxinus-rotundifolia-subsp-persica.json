It features lanceolate to ovate leaves with a distinctive serrated margin and a smooth, pale green underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
