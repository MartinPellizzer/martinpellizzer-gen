    "intro": "Festuca halleri subsp. dura, commonly known as hardy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental grass in gardens with well-drained soil."
