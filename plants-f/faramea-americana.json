    "intro": "Faramea americana, commonly known as the American faramea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. The plant is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Faramea americana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as hammocks and wetlands."
