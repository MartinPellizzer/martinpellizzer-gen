    "intro": "Frailea alexandri, commonly known as the Alexandrian stonecrop, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
