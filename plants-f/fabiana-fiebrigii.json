    "intro": "Fabiana fiebrigii, commonly known as the silverleaf fabiana, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
