    "intro": "Festuca porcii, commonly known as the porcine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, often forming mats or low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca porcii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
