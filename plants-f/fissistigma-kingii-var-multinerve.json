    "intro": "Fissistigma kingii var. multinerve, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mountain tea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves with prominent veins, which give it the varietal name \"multinerve.\" The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
