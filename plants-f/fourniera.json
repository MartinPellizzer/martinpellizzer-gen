    "intro": "Fourniera, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often shed during drought periods, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Fourniera is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and nectar for pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
