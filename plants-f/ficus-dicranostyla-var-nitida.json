    "intro": "Ficus dicranostyla var. nitida, commonly known as the glossy-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and glossy dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
