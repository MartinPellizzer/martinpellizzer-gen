It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This perennial grass is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with cool, moist climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
