    "intro": "Ficus uncinulata, commonly known as the hooked fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fig-like fruits that are encased in a green, fleshy syconium. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
