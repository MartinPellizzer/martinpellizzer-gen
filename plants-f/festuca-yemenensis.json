    "intro": "Festuca yemenensis, commonly known as Yemen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the highlands of Yemen. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
