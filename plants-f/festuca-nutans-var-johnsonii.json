    "intro": "Festuca nutans var. johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features fine, silver-green blades with a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry soils. The plant produces slender, flowering stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, slopes, and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
