    "intro": "Flotovia divaricata, commonly known as the creeping flame vine, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in warm climates."
