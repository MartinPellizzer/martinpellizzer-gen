    "intro": "Foeniculum officinale subsp. pateri, commonly known as the Greek fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant is characterized by its strong anise-like scent due to the presence of volatile oils such as anethole. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to its more widely known relative, common fennel."
