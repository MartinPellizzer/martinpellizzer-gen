    "intro": "Filix fragilis var. cristata, commonly known as the cristate fern, is a variegated cultivar of the common holly fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, frilly, and lace-like fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. The variegation in its fronds is due to a genetic mutation that results in the loss of chlorophyll in certain areas."
