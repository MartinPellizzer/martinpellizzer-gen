It is characterized by its highly variable leaf morphology, which can change in shape, size, and color depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are often veined with a distinct silver or white pattern, making it visually striking. Feuilleea mutata is also noted for its ability to thrive in both moist and dry climates, making it a versatile addition to botanical gardens."
