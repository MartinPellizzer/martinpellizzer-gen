    "intro": "Fraxinus alba, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 7 to 13 opposite leaflets that are serrated and have a pale underside. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in catkins, with male and female flowers on separate trees. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
