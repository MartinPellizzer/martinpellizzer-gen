    "intro": "Ficus falcata, commonly known as the canoe fig, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. Its roots are strong and can be used to make canoes, hence its common name. Ficus falcata thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
