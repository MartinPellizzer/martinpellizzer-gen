    "intro": "Festuca alopecuros var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a clumping growth pattern and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in shaded environments."
