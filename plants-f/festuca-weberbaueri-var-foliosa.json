    "intro": "Festuca weberbaueri var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control in suitable climates."
