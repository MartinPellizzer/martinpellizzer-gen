    "intro": "Festuca abyssinica var. intermedia, commonly known as Abyssinian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
