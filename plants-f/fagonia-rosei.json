    "intro": "Fagonia rosei, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Fagonia rosei is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
