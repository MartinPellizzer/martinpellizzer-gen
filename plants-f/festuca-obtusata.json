    "intro": "Festuca obtusata, commonly known as bluntleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a bluntly pointed tip. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along forest edges. Festuca obtusata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
