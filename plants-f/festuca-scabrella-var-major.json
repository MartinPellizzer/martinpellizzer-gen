    "intro": "Festuca scabrella var. major, commonly known as the tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
