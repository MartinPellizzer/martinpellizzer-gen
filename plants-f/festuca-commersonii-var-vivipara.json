    "intro": "Festuca commersonii var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both sterile and fertile florets. One of its notable features is the presence of viviparous shoots, which can develop into new plants while still attached to the parent. This trait makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and propagation."
