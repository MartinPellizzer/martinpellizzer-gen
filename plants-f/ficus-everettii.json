    "intro": "Ficus everettii, commonly known as the evergreen ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically broad and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor well in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently."
