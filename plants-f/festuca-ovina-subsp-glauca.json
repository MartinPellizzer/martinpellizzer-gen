    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. glauca, commonly known as blue mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and a bluish-gray sheen on the leaves, which gives it its common name. This subspecies is often found in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It forms dense, low-growing tufts and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for erosion control in alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
