    "intro": "Fagraea racemosa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare-flowered fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
