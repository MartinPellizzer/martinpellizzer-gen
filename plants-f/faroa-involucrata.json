    "intro": "Faroa involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Faroa involucrata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
