    "intro": "Ficus setulosa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by smooth, greenish-black berries. It is often used in horticulture for its ability to climb or trail and its tolerance to various environmental conditions. Ficus setulosa is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and is popular as a houseplant or for landscaping purposes."
