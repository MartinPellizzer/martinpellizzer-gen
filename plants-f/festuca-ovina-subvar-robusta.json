    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. robusta, commonly known as sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dark green, narrow leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or poor soils. It is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
