    "intro": "Ferula involucrata, commonly known as the Persian cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and compound umbels of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Ferula involucrata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important plant in regions with limited water resources."
