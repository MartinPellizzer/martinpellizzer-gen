    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. subglaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
