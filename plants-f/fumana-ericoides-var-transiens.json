    "intro": "Fumana ericoides var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Ericoid Heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
