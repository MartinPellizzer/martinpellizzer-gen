    "intro": "Firmiana subglabra, commonly known as the Chinese parasol tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The tree produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
