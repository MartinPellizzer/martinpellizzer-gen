    "intro": "Ficus lauretana, commonly known as the laurel fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are enclosed in a smooth, greenish husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus lauretana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
