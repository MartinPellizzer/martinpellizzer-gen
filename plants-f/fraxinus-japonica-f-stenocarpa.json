It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fruits that are smaller than those of the typical species. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that provide dense shade, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, exhibiting moderate drought tolerance. This cultivar is valued for its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, though it is less hardy than other ash species in colder climates."
