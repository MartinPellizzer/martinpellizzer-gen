    "intro": "Frankenia laevis var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal plains. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for harsh, coastal conditions."
