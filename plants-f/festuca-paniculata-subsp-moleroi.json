    "intro": "Festuca paniculata subsp. moleroi, commonly known as Molero's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense panicle that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
