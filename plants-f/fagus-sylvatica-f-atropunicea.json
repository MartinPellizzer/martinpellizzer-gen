    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. atropunicea, commonly known as the crimson buckeye, is a rare and striking variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown leaves, which are often more vibrant than those of the typical beech. This form is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often growing in the understorey of woodlands. The leaves are usually smaller and more elongated compared to the standard species. Its unique coloration makes it a prized ornamental plant in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
