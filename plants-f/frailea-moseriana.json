    "intro": "Frailea moseriana, commonly known as the Moser's rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is a small, globular plant with a short, thick stem and is characterized by its dense, spiny areoles. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the areoles. Frailea moseriana is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
