    "intro": "Ficus cucurbitina var. eubracteata, commonly known as the Eubracteate Fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense canopy that provides shade. The varietal name \"eubracteata\" refers to the presence of well-developed bracts around the inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature from other ficus species."
