    "intro": "Festuca paniculata, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and panicles of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil. Festuca paniculata is also used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and adaptability to various garden conditions."
