    "intro": "Festuca pseudovivipara, commonly known as the false viviparous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Festuca pseudovivipara is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting insect and bird populations."
