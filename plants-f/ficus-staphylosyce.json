    "intro": "Ficus staphylosyce, commonly known as the silver fig or white-veined fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans. Ficus staphylosyce is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
