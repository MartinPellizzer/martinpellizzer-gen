    "intro": "Fuscospora \u00d7 blairii, commonly known as the hybrid black pine, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Fuscospora macrocarpa and Fuscospora ferruginea. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and conical shape, typical of many pine species. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. It produces small, resinous cones and has needle-like leaves that are often retained for several years. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
