    "intro": "Ficus ruyuanensis, commonly known as the Ruyuan fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to China, specifically the Guangxi region, and is known for its ornamental value due to its glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or red depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens. The Ruyuan fig is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to adapt to various indoor environments."
