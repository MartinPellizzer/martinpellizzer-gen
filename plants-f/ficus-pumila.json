    "intro": "Ficus pumila, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits that are often green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. Ficus pumila is often used in horticulture for its ability to cover walls, trellises, and other structures with its lush foliage."
