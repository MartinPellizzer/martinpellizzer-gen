    "intro": "Festuca glauca subsp. psammophila, commonly known as the sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along riverbanks. Its adaptability makes it an important component of stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
