    "intro": "Frankenia revoluta, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its often-salty, sandy habitat. It typically grows in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Frankenia revoluta is adapted to tolerate high salinity and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
