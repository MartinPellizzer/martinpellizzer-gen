    "intro": "Festuca bastardii, commonly known as bastard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Festuca bastardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
