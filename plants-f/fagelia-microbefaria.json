    "intro": "Fagelia microbefaria, commonly known as the dwarf fagelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast against its delicate white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical collections."
