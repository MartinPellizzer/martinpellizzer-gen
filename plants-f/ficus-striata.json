    "intro": "Ficus striata, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display a striking pattern of light and dark green. Ficus striata is a popular indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fruit, though the fruit is rarely seen in cultivation."
