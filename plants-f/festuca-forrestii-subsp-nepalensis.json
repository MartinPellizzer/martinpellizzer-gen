    "intro": "Festuca forrestii subsp. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal fine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a ground cover in temperate climates."
