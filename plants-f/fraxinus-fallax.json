    "intro": "Fraxinus fallax, commonly known as the stiffleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. Fraxinus fallax is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
