It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Festuca genus. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of alpine and meadow ecosystems."
