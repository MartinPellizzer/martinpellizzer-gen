It is characterized by its small, fleshy, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its succulent leaves, which store water, and its deep root system. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The variety haplotricha is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
