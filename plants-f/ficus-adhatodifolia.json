    "intro": "Ficus adhatodifolia, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically heart-shaped or elliptical. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments. Ficus adhatodifolia is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and adaptability to low-light conditions."
