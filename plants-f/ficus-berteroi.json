    "intro": "Ficus berteroi, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, green fig fruits. Its latex sap, which is milky and sticky, is a notable botanical feature and has been used traditionally for various purposes. Ficus berteroi thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
