    "intro": "Festuca herrerae, commonly known as Herrera's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
