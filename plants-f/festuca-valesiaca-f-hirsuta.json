    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute valley fescue, is a grass species characterized by its hairy foliage and compact growth habit. It is native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
