    "intro": "Fleischmannia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh fleischmannia, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing yellow to orange disc florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Fleischmannia pratensis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
