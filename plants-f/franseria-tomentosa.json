    "intro": "Franseria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly franseria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a unique texture. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Franseria tomentosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
