    "intro": "Festuca scirpoidea, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Festuca scirpoidea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
