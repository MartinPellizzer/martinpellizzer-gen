    "intro": "Festuca geniculata var. glabriglumis, commonly known as the glabrous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green color, with a smooth, glabrous surface. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
