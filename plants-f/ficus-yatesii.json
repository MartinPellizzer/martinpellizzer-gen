It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Ficus yatesii typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its fruit, a small fig, is edible and contains a sweet, sticky pulp surrounded by a fibrous husk."
