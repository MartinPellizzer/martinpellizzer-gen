It is characterized by its striking purple-bronze foliage, which provides ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. This variety is often grown for its aesthetic appeal rather than for its timber. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
