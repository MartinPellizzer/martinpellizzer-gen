    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. bartherei, commonly known as red fescue bartherei, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
