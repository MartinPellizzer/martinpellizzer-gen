    "intro": "Festuca eriantha, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose (hairy) foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and alpine meadows. Festuca eriantha has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, textured appearance."
