    "intro": "Faurea saligna var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaf faurea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to flake off in thin layers. Faurea saligna var. platyphylla is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
