    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. hispidula, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces spikelets with two to three short, awned lemmas, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
