    "intro": "Ficus semicordata var. semicordata, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, oval-shaped fruits that mature to a yellowish color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscaping."
