    "intro": "Festuca parvigluma f. breviaristata, commonly known as the shortawn fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense foliage. It typically features narrow, elongated leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is noted for its short, stiff awns on the glumes, which distinguish it from other fescue varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
