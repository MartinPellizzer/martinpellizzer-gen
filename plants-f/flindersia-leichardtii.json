    "intro": "Flindersia leichardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's flindersia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a large tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in tropical and subtropical gardens."
