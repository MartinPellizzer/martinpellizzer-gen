It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, spiky, cup-like fruits called cupules, which contain edible nuts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained, acidic soils. The Japanese beech is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
