    "intro": "Fraxinus rufa, commonly known as the red ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its root system is shallow but extensive, making it adaptable to various soil types. Fraxinus rufa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplains."
