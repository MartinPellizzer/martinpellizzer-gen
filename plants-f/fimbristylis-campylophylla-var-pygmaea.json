    "intro": "Fimbristylis campylophylla var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf flat-sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, often in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its low stature, usually not exceeding 10 cm in height, and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
