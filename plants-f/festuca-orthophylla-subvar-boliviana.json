It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish to brownish flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
