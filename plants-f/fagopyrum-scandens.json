    "intro": "Fagopyrum scandens, commonly known as creeping buckwheat, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by three-winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
