It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a dense canopy of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, green figs that turn yellow or red when ripe, enclosed in a spherical, woody structure. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize the soil and support surrounding vegetation. The plant is also known for its symbolic and religious significance in various cultures."
