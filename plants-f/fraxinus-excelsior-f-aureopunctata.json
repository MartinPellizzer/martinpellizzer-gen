    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. aureopunctata, commonly known as the golden-spotted ash. This is a rare and distinctive form of the common ash, characterized by its striking golden-yellow spots on the leaves. The foliage is usually smaller and more densely packed compared to the typical species. It is a dioecious plant, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate trees. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas across Europe."
