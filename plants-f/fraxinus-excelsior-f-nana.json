    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf ash, is a compact form of the common ash tree. It features a broad, spreading crown and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. This variety is characterized by its slower growth rate and shorter stature, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces. It retains its foliage year-round, providing ornamental value throughout the seasons. The plant is relatively hardy but may be susceptible to ash dieback disease, which poses a threat to its survival."
