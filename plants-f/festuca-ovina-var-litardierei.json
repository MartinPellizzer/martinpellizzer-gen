    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, rocky environments."
