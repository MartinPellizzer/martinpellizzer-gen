It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface.

Faramea suaveolens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
