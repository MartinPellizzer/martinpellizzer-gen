    "intro": "Farreria, commonly known as the Cape rose or wild rose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and includes several species such as Farreria africana and Farreria bicolor. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth, woody stems, and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while its fruits are small, dry follicles that contain seeds. Farreria is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
