    "intro": "Ficus viscifolia, commonly known as the sticky fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus viscifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
