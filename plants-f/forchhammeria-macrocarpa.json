    "intro": "Forchhammeria macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited Forchhammeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by large, woody capsules containing its seeds. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
