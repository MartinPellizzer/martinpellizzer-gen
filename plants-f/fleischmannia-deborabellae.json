    "intro": "Fleischmannia deborabellae, commonly known as the Debora's ghostflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal dunes of southern California. It is a small annual herb with delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to the sandy, saline conditions of its habitat. It is closely related to other members of the Amaranthaceae family, sharing similar structural and physiological traits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from coastal development and climate change."
