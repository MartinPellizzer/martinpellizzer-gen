    "intro": "Fordiophyton longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a distinctive, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent lip that is often darker in color. Fordiophyton longipes is a relatively rare and endangered species, requiring specific wetland habitats for successful growth."
