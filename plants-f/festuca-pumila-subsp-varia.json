    "intro": "Festuca pumila subsp. varia, commonly known as the variable fine fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
