    "intro": "Festuca hervieri var. costei, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant typically forms dense mats or low-growing clumps, making it well-suited for erosion control in coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune systems."
