    "intro": "Festuca caerulea var. litoralis, commonly known as sea bent grass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and windy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast in maritime landscapes. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating resilience to salt spray and tidal influences. Its compact growth habit helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of dune ecosystems. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas."
