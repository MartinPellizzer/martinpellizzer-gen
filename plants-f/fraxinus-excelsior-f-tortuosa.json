    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted ash, is a botanical variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and branches, which give it a unique and ornamental appearance. This form is typically found in shaded or damp environments, often growing in woodland areas. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, typical of the Fraxinus genus. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds."
