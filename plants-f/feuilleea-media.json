    "intro": "Feuilleea media, commonly known as the silver leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features feathery, delicate fronds that give it a soft, lacy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green with a silvery sheen, especially on the underside. Feuilleea media thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening."
