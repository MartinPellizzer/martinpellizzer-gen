It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged oppositely. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it thrives in humid, warm climates with indirect light. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. The variety is distinguished by its lack of hairy or pubescent surfaces, giving it a sleek appearance."
