    "intro": "Festuca portaliana, commonly known as the Portalian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Festuca portaliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
