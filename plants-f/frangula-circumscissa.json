    "intro": "Frangula circumscissa, commonly known as the narrowleaf cascara, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its laxative properties due to the presence of anthraquinone compounds."
