    "intro": "Fimbristylis complanata var. macrocarya, commonly known as the broad-leaf flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a distinctively smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brown flowers. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Fimbristylis complanata."
