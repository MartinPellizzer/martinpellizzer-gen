    "intro": "Freycinetia kostermansii, commonly known as the Koster's freycinetia, is a species of cycad native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female plants. Its reproductive structures are enclosed within a modified leaf called a spathe, which protects the developing cones. This cycad is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
