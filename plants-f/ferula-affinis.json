It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its sap, which is milky and aromatic, has been traditionally used in folk medicine. Ferula affinis is also valued for its role in the production of essential oils and its potential medicinal properties."
