It is characterized by its unique, spiky foliage and can grow to impressive heights, often reaching over 50 meters. The tree has a long lifespan, with some individuals living for several centuries. Its cones are woody and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Fitzroya is also notable for its slow growth rate and ecological importance in its native habitats."
