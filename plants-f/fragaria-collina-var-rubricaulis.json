    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed woodland strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits are small, red berries with a sweet-tart flavor, similar to common strawberries but less widely cultivated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
