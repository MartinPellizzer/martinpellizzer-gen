    "intro": "Flueggea bailloniana, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in poor soil and extreme drought conditions. Flueggea bailloniana is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes."
