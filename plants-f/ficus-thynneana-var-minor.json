    "intro": "Ficus thynneana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and as a houseplant."
