    "intro": "Ficus exsculpta, commonly known as the sculpted fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, rugged, and often twisted bark, which gives it its common name. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, clustered figs that are typically green or yellow when mature. Ficus exsculpta is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
