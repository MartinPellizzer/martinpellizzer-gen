    "intro": "Festuca setifolia var. lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental grass due to its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
