    "intro": "Festuca sanctae-martae, commonly known as Saint Martha's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. Festuca sanctae-martae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
