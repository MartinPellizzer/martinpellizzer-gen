    "intro": "Ficus deltoidea var. arenaria, commonly known as the desert fig, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, thick leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens with low water requirements."
