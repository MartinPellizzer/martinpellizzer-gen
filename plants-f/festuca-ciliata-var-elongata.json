    "intro": "Festuca ciliata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs along the leaf blades, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, cylindrical spikelet with small, spike-like flowers. Festuca ciliata var. elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
