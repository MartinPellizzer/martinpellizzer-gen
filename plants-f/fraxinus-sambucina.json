    "intro": "Fraxinus sambucina, commonly known as the European ash or black ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a tall, straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits called samaras. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures as the tree matures."
