    "intro": "Flemingia nana, commonly known as the dwarf flemingia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters and features simple, alternate leaves that are often ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Flemingia nana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
