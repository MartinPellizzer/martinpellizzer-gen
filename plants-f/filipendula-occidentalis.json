It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites. Its roots have a long history of use in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
