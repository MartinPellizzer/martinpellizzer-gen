    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. planifolia, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant green foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
