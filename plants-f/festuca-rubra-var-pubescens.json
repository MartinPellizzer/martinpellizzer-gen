    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pubescens, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pink or reddish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its hardiness. Festuca rubra var. pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought and moderate grazing."
