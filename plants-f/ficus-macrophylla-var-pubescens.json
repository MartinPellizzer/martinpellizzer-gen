    "intro": "Ficus macrophylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the glossy-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and deeply lobed leaves that are typically a vibrant green with a glossy sheen. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits known as figs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
