    "intro": "Festuca decolorans, commonly known as the decoloring fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that often turn reddish or bronze in color during the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along riverbanks. Festuca decolorans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a variety of pollinators and soil stabilization."
