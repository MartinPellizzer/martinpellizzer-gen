    "intro": "Fragaria nivea, commonly known as the snow strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It produces small, white flowers that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets that are covered in a soft, woolly texture. Its fruit, though not typically consumed by humans, is a small, white, berry-like structure that develops from the flower. Fragaria nivea is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
