    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica var. multiflora, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow, with a distinctive red or purple rim. The plant produces multiple flowers per stem, often arranged in clusters, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
