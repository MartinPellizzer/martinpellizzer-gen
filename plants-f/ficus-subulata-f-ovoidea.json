It features small, ovate, waxy leaves that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and minimal water requirements. Its unique leaf shape and ease of care make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
