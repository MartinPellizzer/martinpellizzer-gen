    "intro": "Festuca boissieri, commonly known as Boissier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal. Festuca boissieri is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
