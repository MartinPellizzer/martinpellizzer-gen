    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. juncea, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense growth habit, making it well-suited for lawns and pastures. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is tolerant of both drought and light frost. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense mats, contributing to its use in erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
