    "intro": "Festuca malzevii, commonly known as Malzev's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often pale green to brown in color. Festuca malzevii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species in alpine and arctic ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range."
