    "intro": "Feuilleea filipes, commonly known as the featherleaf fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical rainforests. It features elongated, slender leaves that resemble feathers, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are inconspicuous and appear in clusters. Feuilleea filipes thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces."
