    "intro": "Fuirena tenuis, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thin, foliose thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found growing on bark, stones, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is used as an indicator species for air quality."
