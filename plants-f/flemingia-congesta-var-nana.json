It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover."
