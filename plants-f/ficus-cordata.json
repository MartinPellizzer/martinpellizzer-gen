    "intro": "Ficus cordata, commonly known as the heart-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, pale green fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal. Ficus cordata has a shallow root system, making it suitable for container gardening."
