    "intro": "Festuca karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavsky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to dry, semi-arid environments and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Festuca karatavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid regions."
