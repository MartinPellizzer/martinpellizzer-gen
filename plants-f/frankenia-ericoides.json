    "intro": "Frankenia ericoides, commonly known as coastal bluemontain, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Frankenia ericoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
