    "intro": "Ficus reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, ovate leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. Ficus reticulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
