    "intro": "Festuca austrouralensis, commonly known as the southern alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, and it is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Festuca austrouralensis is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in fragile mountain ecosystems."
