    "intro": "Ficus sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in lowland to montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, and it relies on specific fig wasps for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
