It is characterized by its silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-gray coloration due to the presence of dense trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca glauca subsp. buiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
