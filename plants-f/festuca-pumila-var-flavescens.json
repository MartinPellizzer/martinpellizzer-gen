    "intro": "Festuca pumila var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow alpine feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically a light green to yellowish color. The plant produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ability to form dense, mat-like growths that stabilize soil and provide habitat for alpine wildlife."
