    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica f. albarracinensis, commonly known as the Albarracin narcissus, is a rare botanical variant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. This subspecies typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in high-altitude regions. The plant exhibits a bulbous root system typical of the Fritillaria genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
