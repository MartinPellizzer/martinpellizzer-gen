    "intro": "Fusifilum depressum, commonly known as the flat-stemmed fusifilum, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, fusiform stems that often lie flat on the ground, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Fusifilum depressum is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is considered a specialist species with limited distribution."
