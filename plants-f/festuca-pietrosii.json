    "intro": "Festuca pietrosii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. Festuca pietrosii is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that resist erosion."
