    "intro": "Festuca plonkae, commonly known as the Plonka's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca plonkae is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
