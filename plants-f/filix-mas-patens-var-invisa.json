    "intro": "Filix-mas patens var. invisa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a variant of the common fern species Filix-mas. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically longer and wider than those of the standard variety. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
