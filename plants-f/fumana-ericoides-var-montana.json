    "intro": "Fumana ericoides var. montana, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
