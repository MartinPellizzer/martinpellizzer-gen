    "intro": "Freycinetia timorensis, commonly known as the Timor screw-palm, is a member of the palms family (Arecaceae) native to the island of Timor. It is a medium-sized, evergreen tree with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by elongated, three-angled fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Freycinetia timorensis is adapted to tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
