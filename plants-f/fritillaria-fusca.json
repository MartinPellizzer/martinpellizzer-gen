    "intro": "Fritillaria fusca, commonly known as the black death lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, often purplish or blackish bulbs and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows and woodlands. Fritillaria fusca is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
