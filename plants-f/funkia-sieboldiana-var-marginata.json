    "intro": "Funkia sieboldiana var. marginata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white margin, which sets it apart from other varieties. The plant typically grows in shallow water or wet soil, often found in marshes and pond edges. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to water gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
