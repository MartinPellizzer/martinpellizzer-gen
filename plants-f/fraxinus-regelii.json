It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in autumn. Fraxinus regelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful form and seasonal interest."
