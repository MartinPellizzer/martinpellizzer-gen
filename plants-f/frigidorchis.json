    "intro": "Frigidorchis, commonly known as the Arctic orchid, is a rare and cold-adapted plant species found in high-altitude and arctic regions. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and has a unique ability to survive in harsh, frost-prone environments. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats to conserve heat and moisture. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Frigidorchis is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitats."
