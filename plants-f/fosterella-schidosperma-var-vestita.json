    "intro": "Fosterella schidosperma var. vestita, commonly known as the white-berried poinsettia, is a striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. Its leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variant is distinguished by its white berries, which contrast with the colorful bracts, making it a unique and visually appealing plant."
