    "intro": "Festuca laevis var. jeanpertii, commonly known as Jeanpert's fine fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
