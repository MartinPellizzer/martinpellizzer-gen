    "intro": "Festuca acamptophylla, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Festuca acamptophylla thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
