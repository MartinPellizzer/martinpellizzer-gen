    "intro": "Ficus brassii, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus brassii is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
