    "intro": "Festuca balearica, commonly known as the Balearic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Festuca balearica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
