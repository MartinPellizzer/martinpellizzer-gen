    "intro": "Festuca laxa subsp. dimorpha, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
