    "intro": "Festuca pallens f. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent meadow fescue, is a variant of the meadow fescue species characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves. This grass is typically found in temperate regions, often in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows or along stream banks. The plant has a clump-forming growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, which helps distinguish it from similar species. The pubiculmis form is notable for its dense covering of fine hairs, which may aid in reducing water loss and increasing drought tolerance."
