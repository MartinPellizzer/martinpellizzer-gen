    "intro": "Fraxinus bicolor, commonly known as the white and yellow ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking dichotomous branching pattern, which creates a unique and often ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by samaras that have two distinct, winged lobes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability."
