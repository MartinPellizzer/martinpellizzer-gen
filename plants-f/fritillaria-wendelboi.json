    "intro": "Fritillaria wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid conditions, entering a dormant state during dry periods. Fritillaria wendelboi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
