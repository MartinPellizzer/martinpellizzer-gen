It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant bears small, edible fruits that are often described as having a more intense flavor compared to the common garden strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
