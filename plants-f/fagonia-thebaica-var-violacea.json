    "intro": "Fagonia thebaica var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered fagonia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
