    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. sancti-joannis, commonly known as the San Giovanni fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in suitable climates."
