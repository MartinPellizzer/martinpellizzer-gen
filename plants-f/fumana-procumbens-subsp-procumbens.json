    "intro": "Fumana procumbens subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping fumana, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. This species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
