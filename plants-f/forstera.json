These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, often growing in dense clusters. They produce showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, intricate flowers that are often pink or purple in color. Forstera species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The genus includes several species, such as Forstera ovata and Forstera glabrata, which are native to various regions in Europe and Asia."
