    "intro": "Fraxinus rotundifolia subsp. bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Sierra maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that are typically green on top and whitish underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use in arid landscapes."
