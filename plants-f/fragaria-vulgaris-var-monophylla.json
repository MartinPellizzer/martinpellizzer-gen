    "intro": "Fragaria vulgaris var. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf strawberry, is a variant of the common strawberry plant. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single leaf per node along the stem. This variety typically produces small, tart berries that are less commercially valuable than the standard strawberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or shaded gardens. The plant's botanical interest lies in its distinct morphology and genetic variation within the Fragaria genus."
