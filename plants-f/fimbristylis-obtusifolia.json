    "intro": "Fimbristylis obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments. Fimbristylis obtusifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
