    "intro": "Flindersia brachycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves that are opposite and trifoliate. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers followed by large, fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its seeds are enclosed in a persistent, woody capsule that splits open when mature. Flindersia brachycarpa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in indigenous cultures."
