    "intro": "Ficus globosa var. manok, commonly known as the Manok fig, is a rare and unique variant of the ficus genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tropical flavor. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among botanical enthusiasts."
