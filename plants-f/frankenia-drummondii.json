    "intro": "Frankenia drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Frankenia drummondii is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
