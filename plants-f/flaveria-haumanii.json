    "intro": "Flaveria haumanii, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a woolly texture due to the dense pubescence. Flaveria haumanii is adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
