    "intro": "Fraxinus cerasifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive, opposite, ovate leaves that resemble those of cherry trees, hence its common name. The small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
