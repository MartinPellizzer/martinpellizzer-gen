    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria var. picbaueri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pink to white flower heads that resemble small clouds, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are narrow and serrated. This variety is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils."
