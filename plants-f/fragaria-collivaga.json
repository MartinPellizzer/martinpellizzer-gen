    "intro": "Fragaria collivaga, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of cultivated strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
