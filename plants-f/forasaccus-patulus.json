    "intro": "Forasaccus patulus, commonly known as the broad-leafed saccate plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
