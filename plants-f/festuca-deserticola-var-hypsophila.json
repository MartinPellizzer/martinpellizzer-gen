    "intro": "Festuca deserticola var. hypsophila, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
