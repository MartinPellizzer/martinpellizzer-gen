    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana var. platycarpa, commonly known as the flatpod ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive flat, elongated fruits that mature to a dark brown. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and landscape use. The variety is notable for its unique fruit morphology, which differs from the typical ash species."
