    "intro": "Ficus citrifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shorter, broader leaves compared to the standard variety, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, green figs that are typically not edible for humans but are important for wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
