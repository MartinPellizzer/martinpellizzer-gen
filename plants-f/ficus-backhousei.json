    "intro": "Ficus backhousei, commonly known as the African ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus backhousei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
