    "intro": "Feuilleea tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical rainforests. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, where it clings to tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in compact sori on the underside of the leaves. Feuilleea tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded garden beds."
