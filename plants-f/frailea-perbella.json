    "intro": "Frailea perbella, commonly known as the Everlasting Cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the warm season, typically in summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Frailea perbella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
