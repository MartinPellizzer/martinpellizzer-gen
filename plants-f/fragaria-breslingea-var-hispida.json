    "intro": "Fragaria breslingea var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid strawberry, is a rare and little-known species of the strawberry genus. It is characterized by its hairy or hispid surface on its stems and leaves, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, similar to common strawberries. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it grows in moist, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying wild strawberry species."
