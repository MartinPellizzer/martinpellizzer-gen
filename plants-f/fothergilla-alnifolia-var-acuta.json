    "intro": "Fothergilla alnifolia var. acuta, commonly known as sharpleaf fothergilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its seasonal color changes and delicate floral display."
