    "intro": "Ficus riedelii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a compact species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by non-edible, spherical fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
