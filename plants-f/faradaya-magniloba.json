It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
