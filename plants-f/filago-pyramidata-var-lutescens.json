    "intro": "Filago pyramidata var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden filago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features wiry, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, pyramid-shaped inflorescences, which give it its species name \"pyramidata.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its pale yellow to golden flower color, setting it apart from other Filago species."
