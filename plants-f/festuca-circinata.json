    "intro": "Festuca circinata, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically rolled in a spiral, a characteristic feature of the genus Festuca. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca circinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
