    "intro": "Fortunatia arida, commonly known as the desert starflower, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Australia. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Fortunatia arida is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
