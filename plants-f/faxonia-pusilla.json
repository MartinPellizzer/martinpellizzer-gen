    "intro": "Faxonia pusilla, commonly known as the small saxifrage, is a small perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, with tiny, clustered leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Its flowers are small, usually pink or purple, and appear in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Faxonia pusilla is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
