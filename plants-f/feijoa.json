    "intro": "Feijoa, commonly known as pineapple guava, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It produces fragrant, citrus-like fruits with a unique combination of sweet and tart flavors. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is typically harvested when it turns a yellowish-green color and develops a slight blush. Feijoa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in subtropical climates for both its fruit and foliage."
