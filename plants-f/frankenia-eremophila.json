    "intro": "Frankenia eremophila, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding visual interest to its habitat. Its thick, waxy leaves and salt-tolerant nature make it well-suited for coastal dunes and sandy soils. Frankenia eremophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
