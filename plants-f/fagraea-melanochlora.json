    "intro": "Fagraea melanochlora, commonly known as the black-leaved fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible but often have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Fagraea melanochlora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
