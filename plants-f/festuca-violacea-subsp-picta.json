    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. picta, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and striking violet-blue flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its vivid coloration and delicate appearance, making it a popular choice for garden planting. The subspecies picta is distinguished by its more intense coloration compared to the typical form of Festuca violacea."
