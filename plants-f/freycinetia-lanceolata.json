    "intro": "Freycinetia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by edible berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it suitable for ornamental and landscaping purposes. Freycinetia lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas."
