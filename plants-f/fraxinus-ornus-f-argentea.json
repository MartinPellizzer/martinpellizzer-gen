    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus f. argentea, commonly known as the silver weeping ash, is a decorative cultivar of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This cultivar is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and graceful, weeping growth habit."
