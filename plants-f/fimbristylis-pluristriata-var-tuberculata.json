    "intro": "Fimbristylis pluristriata var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-ranked flowers. The tuberculate variety is distinguished by the presence of small, rounded bumps on its stem and leaves, giving it a unique texture."
