It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Fabricia coriacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
