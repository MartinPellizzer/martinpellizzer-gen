    "intro": "Fragaria \u00d7 bringhurstii, commonly known as the Bringhurst strawberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the wild woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and the garden strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa). It is characterized by its small, aromatic berries that are typically red when ripe, though some cultivars may produce yellow or white fruits. The plant has a compact growth habit with trifoliate leaves and produces runners, allowing it to spread and establish new plants. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it suitable for both ornamental and edible cultivation. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for study in plant genetics and horticulture."
