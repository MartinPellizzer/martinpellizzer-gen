    "intro": "Faurea, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, typically found in high-altitude environments such as rocky slopes and mountainous regions. The plants are evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Faurea species are adapted to poor, acidic soils and have a slow growth rate, making them resilient to harsh environmental conditions. Their ecological significance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in their native habitats."
