    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior subsp. biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a subspecies of the common ash native to Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical F. excelsior. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. This subspecies is often found in woodland margins and along riverbanks, contributing to its ecological significance."
