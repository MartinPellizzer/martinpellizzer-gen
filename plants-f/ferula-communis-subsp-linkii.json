    "intro": "Ferula communis subsp. linkii, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky, aromatic sap that has been traditionally used in local medicine and as a flavoring agent. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, pungent odor, while its roots are thick and fibrous. This species is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
