    "intro": "Fumana baetica, commonly known as the Baetican fumana, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a subtle, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fumana baetica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
