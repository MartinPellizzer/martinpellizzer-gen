    "intro": "Freycinetia angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender, and often branched stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Freycinetia angustissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
