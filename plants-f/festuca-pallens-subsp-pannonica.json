    "intro": "Festuca pallens subsp. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
