    "intro": "Fritillaria viridea, commonly known as the green starflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or white, with a distinctive star-like pattern. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, and they store nutrients to support growth during periods of dormancy. Fritillaria viridea is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer."
