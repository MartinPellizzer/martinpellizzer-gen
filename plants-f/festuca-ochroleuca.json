    "intro": "Festuca ochroleuca, commonly known as yellow tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other grasses. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters. Festuca ochroleuca is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
