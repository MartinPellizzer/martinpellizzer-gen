    "intro": "Ficus guapoi var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
