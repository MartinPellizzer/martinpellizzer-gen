    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla f. leiophylla, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky-textured leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety is known for its dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it ideal for ground cover. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form a lush, uniform carpet."
