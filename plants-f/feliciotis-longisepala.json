    "intro": "Feliciotis longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a strikingly intricate pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned along the margins of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Feliciotis longisepala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
