    "intro": "Ficus maclellandii var. rhododendrifolia, commonly known as the Rhododendron-leaved Fig, is a unique hybrid plant that combines features of both ficus and rhododendron species. It is characterized by its striking, rhododendron-like leaves that are broad, leathery, and often have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible and attract various wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
