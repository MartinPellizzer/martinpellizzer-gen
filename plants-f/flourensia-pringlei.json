    "intro": "Flourensia pringlei, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Flourensia pringlei is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone habitats."
