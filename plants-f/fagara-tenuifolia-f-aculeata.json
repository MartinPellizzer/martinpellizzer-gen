    "intro": "Fagara tenuifolia f. aculeata, commonly known as the spiny fagara, is a horticultural form of the evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and distinctive, spiny stems that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by clusters of bright red berries, which are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
