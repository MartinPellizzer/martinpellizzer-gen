It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and the flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually white or pale yellow. Fagelia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
