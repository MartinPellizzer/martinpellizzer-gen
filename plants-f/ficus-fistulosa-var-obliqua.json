    "intro": "Ficus fistulosa var. obliqua, commonly known as the oblique fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
