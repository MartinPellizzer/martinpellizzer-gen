    "intro": "Festuca savii, commonly known as the Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca savii thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
