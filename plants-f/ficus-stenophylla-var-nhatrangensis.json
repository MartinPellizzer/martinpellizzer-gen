    "intro": "Ficus stenophylla var. nhatrangensis, commonly known as the Nhatrang fig, is a rare and specialized variant of the ficus genus native to Vietnam. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, elongated leaves with a distinct waxy texture. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by edible figs that contribute to local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
