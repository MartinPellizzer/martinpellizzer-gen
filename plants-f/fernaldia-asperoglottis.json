The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Fernaldia asperoglottis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
