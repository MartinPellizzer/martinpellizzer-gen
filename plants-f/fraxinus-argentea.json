It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits. Silver ash prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in woodworking."
