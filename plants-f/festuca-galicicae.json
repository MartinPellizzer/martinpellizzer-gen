    "intro": "Festuca galicicae, commonly known as Galician fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca galicicae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
