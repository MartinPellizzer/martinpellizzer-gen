    "intro": "Festuca pflanzii, commonly known as Pflanz's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pflanzii is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
