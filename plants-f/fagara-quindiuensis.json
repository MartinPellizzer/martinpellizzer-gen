    "intro": "Fagara quindiuensis, commonly known as the Quind\u00edo fagara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Berberidaceae. It is native to the Andean region of Colombia, where it thrives in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. It produces berries that are typically red or orange when mature, containing several seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and susceptibility to deforestation, Fagara quindiuensis is considered a vulnerable species."
