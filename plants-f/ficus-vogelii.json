    "intro": "Ficus vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Ficus vogelii is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
