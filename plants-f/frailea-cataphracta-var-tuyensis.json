    "intro": "Frailea cataphracta var. tuyensis, commonly known as the Tuyense Cactus, is a species native to Ecuador. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
