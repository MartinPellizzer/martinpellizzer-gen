    "intro": "Festuca subbiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which make it well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Festuca subbiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
