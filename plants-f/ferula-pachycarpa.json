    "intro": "Ferula pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-barked ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, often woody stem and its ability to thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. The plant produces tall spikes of yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Ferula pachycarpa is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
