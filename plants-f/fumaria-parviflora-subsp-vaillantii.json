    "intro": "Fumaria parviflora subsp. vaillantii, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in loose racemes and are often overlooked due to their modest size. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
