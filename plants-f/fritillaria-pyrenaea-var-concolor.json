    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaea var. concolor, commonly known as the purple-fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically a deep purple or violet, with a contrasting white or cream base. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
