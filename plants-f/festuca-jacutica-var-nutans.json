    "intro": "Festuca jacutica var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces panicles of small, greenish to brownish flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. Festuca jacutica var. nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
