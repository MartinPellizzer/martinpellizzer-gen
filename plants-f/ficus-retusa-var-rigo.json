    "intro": "Ficus retusa var. rigo, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a cultivar of the Ficus retusa species, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or cream variegation patterns. The plant is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree, often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability to indoor conditions. It produces small, inedible fruits and has a fast growth rate, making it popular for decorative purposes. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its unique leaf appearance."
