    "intro": "Ficus infectoria var. fraseri, commonly known as the African rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. It is a popular indoor plant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its rubbery sap, which is toxic, has historically been used in traditional medicine and as a natural rubber source."
