    "intro": "Ficus oleifolia var. epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ability to grow as an epiphyte, attaching itself to other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in humid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
