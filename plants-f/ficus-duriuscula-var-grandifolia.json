    "intro": "Ficus duriuscula var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
