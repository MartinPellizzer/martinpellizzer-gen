    "intro": "Fedia locusta var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fedia, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against harsh weather conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind rather than insects. Its leaves are typically evergreen and have a unique structure that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
