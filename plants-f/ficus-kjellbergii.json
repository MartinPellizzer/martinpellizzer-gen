    "intro": "Ficus kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus kjellbergii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
