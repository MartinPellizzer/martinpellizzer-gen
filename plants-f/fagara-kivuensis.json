    "intro": "Fagara kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu fagara, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagara kivuensis is considered a rare and poorly studied species."
