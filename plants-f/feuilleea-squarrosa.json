    "intro": "Feuilleea squarrosa, commonly known as the wrinkled leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive, crinkled foliage. Native to arid regions, it thrives in low-water environments with well-draining soil. The leaves are thick and leathery, which helps reduce water loss and adapt to harsh conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
