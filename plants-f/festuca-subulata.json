    "intro": "Festuca subulata, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to greenish flowers. Festuca subulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
