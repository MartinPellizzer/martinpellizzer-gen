    "intro": "Ficus callophylla, commonly known as the golden fig or Callophylla ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elongated and slightly wavy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus callophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
