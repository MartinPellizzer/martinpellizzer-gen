    "intro": "Freycinetia backeri, commonly known as the Pukapuka cycad, is a species of cycad native to the Cook Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
