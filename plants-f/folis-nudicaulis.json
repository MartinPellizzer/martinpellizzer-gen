    "intro": "Folis nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures that are often clustered in dense, cushion-like formations. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures called thallus that absorb water and nutrients directly from the environment. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rock crevices. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in humid microclimates and is a common indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems."
