It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions with high humidity and warm climates. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Feuilleea mutica thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
