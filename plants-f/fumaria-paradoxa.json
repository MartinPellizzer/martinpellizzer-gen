    "intro": "Fumaria paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fumariaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a distinctive, pungent odor, which is thought to attract certain pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branched. Fumaria paradoxa is typically found in woodland edges and rocky soils, and it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
