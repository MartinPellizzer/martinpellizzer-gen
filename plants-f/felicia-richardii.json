    "intro": "Felicia richardii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily by wind. Felicia richardii has a compact, low-growing habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh desert conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant adapted to extreme environments."
