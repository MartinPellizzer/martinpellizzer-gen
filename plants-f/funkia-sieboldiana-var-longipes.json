    "intro": "Funkia sieboldiana var. longipes, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which can help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
