    "intro": "Festuca elbrusica, commonly known as the Elbrus grass, is a species of grass native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine regions. Festuca elbrusica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for mountainous flora and fauna."
