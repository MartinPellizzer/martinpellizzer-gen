    "intro": "Fingardia nephroglossa, commonly known as the kidney-tongue plant, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist environments. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
