    "intro": "Festuca maritima var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control along coastal areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological importance in coastal habitats."
