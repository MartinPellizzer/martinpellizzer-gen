    "intro": "Ficus deltoidea subsp. deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid fig, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
