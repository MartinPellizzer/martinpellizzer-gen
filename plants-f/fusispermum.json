    "intro": "Fusispermum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or yellowish flowers. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. Fusispermum species are adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making them resilient in harsh environments. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
