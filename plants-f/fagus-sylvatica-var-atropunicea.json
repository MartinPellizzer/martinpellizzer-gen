    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. atropunicea, commonly known as the purple-leafed beech, is a rare and striking variant of the common beech. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark reddish-purple foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical green of the standard species. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, leading to the unique leaf coloration. The tree retains its autumnal hues throughout much of the growing season, making it a striking ornamental plant. It is typically found in specific regions of Europe, where its unusual appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
