    "intro": "Fritillaria fleischeri, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red, often with contrasting black markings. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are grass-like and emerge from the base of the bulb, often in early spring. Fritillaria fleischeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
