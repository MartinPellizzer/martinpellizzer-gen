    "intro": "Festuca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are native to the Northern Hemisphere and are characterized by their tufted growth habit and often fine, bluish-green foliage. Festuca species are widely used in lawns, pastures, and as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Many species are adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both temperate and colder climates. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
