    "intro": "Festuca kryloviana f. subvillosa, commonly known as the Krylovian fescue, is a variant of the Krylovian fescue species, characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage. It is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The subspecies subvillosa is distinguished by its slightly hairy or pubescent leaves, which give it a soft texture compared to the more glabrous forms of the species. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces dense, tufted growth patterns. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
