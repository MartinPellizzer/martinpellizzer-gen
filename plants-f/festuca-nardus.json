    "intro": "Festuca nardus, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Festuca nardus is also known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a resilient plant in wetland environments."
