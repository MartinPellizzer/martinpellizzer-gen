    "intro": "Farinopsis, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are slender and often covered in a fine, sticky coating, which helps in adhering to surfaces. Farinopsis is known for its simple morphology and specialized adaptations for aquatic life."
