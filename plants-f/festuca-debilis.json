    "intro": "Festuca debilis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically light green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. Festuca debilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments. It is generally hardy and adaptable, thriving in areas with cool, temperate climates."
