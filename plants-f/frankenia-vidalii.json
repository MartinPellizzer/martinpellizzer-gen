    "intro": "Frankenia vidalii, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Frankenia vidalii is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall."
