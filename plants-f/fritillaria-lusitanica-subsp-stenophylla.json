    "intro": "Fritillaria lusitanica subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
