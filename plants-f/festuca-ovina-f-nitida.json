    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. nitida, commonly known as silver sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, bluish-gray blades that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are small and often inconspicuous. Festuca ovina f. nitida is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal environments."
