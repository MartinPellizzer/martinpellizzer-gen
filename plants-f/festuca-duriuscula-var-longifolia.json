    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically long and narrow, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
