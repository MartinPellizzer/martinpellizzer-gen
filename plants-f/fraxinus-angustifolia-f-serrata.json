    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. serrata, commonly known as the serrated ash, is a variant of the narrow-leaf ash. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are distinctly serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
