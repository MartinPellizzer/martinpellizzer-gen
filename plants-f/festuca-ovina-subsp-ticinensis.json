    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. ticinensis, commonly known as Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
