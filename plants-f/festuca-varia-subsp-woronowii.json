It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
