    "intro": "Filago arvensis, commonly known as the field filago, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Filago arvensis is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
