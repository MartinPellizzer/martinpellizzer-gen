    "intro": "Fagraea chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly or golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Fagraea chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
