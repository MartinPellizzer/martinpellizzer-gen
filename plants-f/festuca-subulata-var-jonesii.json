    "intro": "Festuca subulata var. jonesii, commonly known as Jones' needlegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, sharp-pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
