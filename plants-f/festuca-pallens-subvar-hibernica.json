    "intro": "Festuca pallens subvar. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish meadow grass, is a cool-season grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage that turns bluish-gray in dry conditions. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
