    "intro": "Frailea castanea subvar. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny frailea, is a compact cactus native to southern Africa. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem covered in short, spiny bristles. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
