    "intro": "Festuca subcontorta, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common groundcover. Festuca subcontorta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping."
