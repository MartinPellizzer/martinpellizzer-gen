It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Polynesia and Melanesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible berries. Freycinetia pycnophylla thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing along the edges of forests or in open areas with well-drained soil."
