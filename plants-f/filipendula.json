These plants are characterized by their showy, pink or white flower clusters that resemble small umbrellas. They typically grow in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Filipendula species have fern-like leaves and are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Their flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
