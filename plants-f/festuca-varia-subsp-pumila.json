    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. pumila, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with harsh climates."
