    "intro": "Filago maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Filago maritima is well adapted to maritime conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
