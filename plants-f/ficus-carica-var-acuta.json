    "intro": "Ficus carica var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved fig, is a variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its pointed, acuminate leaves that give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to those of the common fig but are often less commercially cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and its potential for fruit production in suitable environments."
