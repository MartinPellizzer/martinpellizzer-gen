    "intro": "Festuca distans f. pallens, commonly known as the pale festuca, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. It typically forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to silver flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
