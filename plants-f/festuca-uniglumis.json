    "intro": "Festuca uniglumis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca uniglumis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
