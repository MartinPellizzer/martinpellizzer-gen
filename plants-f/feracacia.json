    "intro": "Feracacia, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a red or orange calyx. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and slightly serrated. Feracacia thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
