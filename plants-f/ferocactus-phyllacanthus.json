    "intro": "Ferocactus phyllacanthus, commonly known as the golden fish spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its bright yellow spines and ribbed, cylindrical stems. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Ferocactus phyllacanthus is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
