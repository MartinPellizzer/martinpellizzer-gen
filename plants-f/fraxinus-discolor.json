    "intro": "Fraxinus discolor, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The white ash is valued for its strong, flexible wood, which has been used historically for tool handles and sports equipment."
