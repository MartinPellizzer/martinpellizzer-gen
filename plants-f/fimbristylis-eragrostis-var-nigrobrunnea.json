    "intro": "Fimbristylis eragrostis var. nigrobrunnea, commonly known as black-brown false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a distinct, fibrous texture. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelets that are usually brown or black in color. This variety is characterized by its dark-colored bracts and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
