    "intro": "Fagraea litoralis, commonly known as the coastal fagraea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows near the shoreline, where it can tolerate saline and humid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fagraea litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
