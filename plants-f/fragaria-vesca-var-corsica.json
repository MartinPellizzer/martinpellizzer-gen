    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common garden strawberry. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
