    "intro": "Frasera albicaulis var. cusickii, commonly known as the White fir or Cusick's frasera, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the western United States. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae, which includes plants known for their unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and a distinctive, tubular flower that is typically white or pale green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
