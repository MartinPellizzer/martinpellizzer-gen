    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa f. cuspidifera, commonly known as the pointed-leaf fig, is a variant of the ficus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically pointed at the tips. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are edible for certain animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring bright, indirect light and consistently moist soil. Its adaptability and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
