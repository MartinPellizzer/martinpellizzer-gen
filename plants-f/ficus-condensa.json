    "intro": "Ficus condensa, commonly known as the glossy leaf ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and glossy dark green leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. The plant's adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
