    "intro": "Festuca alpina var. viridis, commonly known as Alpine green fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca alpina var. viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
