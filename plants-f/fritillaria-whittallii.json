    "intro": "Fritillaria whittallii, commonly known as the Whittall's fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting purple or black markings. The plant belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
