    "intro": "Festuca cyllenica, commonly known as the Cyllenica fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold climates. Festuca cyllenica is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
