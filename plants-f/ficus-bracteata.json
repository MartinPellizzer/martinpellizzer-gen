    "intro": "Ficus bracteata, commonly known as the silver leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered fruits known as syconia, which are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus bracteata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
