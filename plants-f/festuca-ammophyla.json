    "intro": "Festuca ammophyla, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy and saline environments, often found along dunes and shores where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Festuca ammophyla is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
