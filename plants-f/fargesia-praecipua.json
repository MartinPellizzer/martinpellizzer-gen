It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, arching clusters of slender, silver-blue leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by fluffy, grayish-brown seeds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Fargesia praecipua is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and as a ground cover in woodland settings."
