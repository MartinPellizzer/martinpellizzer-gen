    "intro": "Ficus angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe, characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Ficus angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
