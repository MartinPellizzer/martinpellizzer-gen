    "intro": "Fernandezia subbiflora, commonly known as the two-flowered fernandezia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous areas with cool climates. Fernandezia subbiflora has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces two small flowers per umbel, giving it its common name. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
