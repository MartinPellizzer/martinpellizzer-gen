    "intro": "Fleischmannia bridgesii, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Fleischmannia bridgesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
