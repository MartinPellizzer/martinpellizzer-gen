It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. The species is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
