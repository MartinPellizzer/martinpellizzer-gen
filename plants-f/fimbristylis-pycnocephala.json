    "intro": "Fimbristylis pycnocephala, commonly known as the dense-headed flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with tiny, wind-pollinated florets that mature into small, dry seeds. Fimbristylis pycnocephala plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
