    "intro": "Ferocactus rostii, commonly known as the Mexican devil's claw, is a spiny cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a rounded, ribbed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with prominent spines and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its adaptations to harsh desert conditions include deep root systems and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Ferocactus rostii is well-suited for cultivation in hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping."
