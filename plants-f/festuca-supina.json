    "intro": "Festuca supina, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, tufted leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Festuca supina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance."
