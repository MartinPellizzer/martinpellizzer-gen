    "intro": "Frangula rotundifolia, commonly known as the Downy Broom. It is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in anthraquinone compounds, making it valuable in herbal medicine. Its root bark is used for its laxative properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, woodland environments."
