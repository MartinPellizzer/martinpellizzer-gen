    "intro": "Fagonia arabica var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access underground water. It is often found in rocky soils and can tolerate saline conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a drought-resistant ornamental plant."
