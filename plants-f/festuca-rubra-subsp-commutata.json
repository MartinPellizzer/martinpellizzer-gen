    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. commutata, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or bronze hues, especially in cooler weather. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca rubra subsp. commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
