    "intro": "Ficus sericea, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a silky appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruit, known as a fig, is small and green, containing a sweet, edible pulp. Ficus sericea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
