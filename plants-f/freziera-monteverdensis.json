    "intro": "Freziera monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde freziera, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in the humid and misty conditions of its montane habitat. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
