    "intro": "Feuilleea dysantha, commonly known as the silverleaf starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a waxy surface that reflects light, aiding in water conservation. Feuilleea dysantha thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
