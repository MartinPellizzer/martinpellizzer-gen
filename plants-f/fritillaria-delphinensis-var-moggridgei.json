    "intro": "Fritillaria delphinensis var. moggridgei, commonly known as the Moggridge's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
