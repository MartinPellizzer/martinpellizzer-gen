    "intro": "Fraxinus nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spherical clusters, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and bottomlands. Nuttall's white ash is valued for its strong, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
