    "intro": "Fimbristylis portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its slender, grass-like stems are often covered with fine, thread-like hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Fimbristylis portoricensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
