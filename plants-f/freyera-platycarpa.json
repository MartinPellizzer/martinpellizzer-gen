    "intro": "Freyera platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited freyera, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a distinctive, thick-walled capsule that contains several small, hard seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Freyera platycarpa is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
