    "intro": "Filetia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Filetia is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas, where it can become invasive in some regions."
