    "intro": "Fritillaria rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with a contrasting darker throat. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a cluster of bulbs that store nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
