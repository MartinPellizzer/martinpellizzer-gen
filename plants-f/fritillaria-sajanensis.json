    "intro": "Fritillaria sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short stem that supports its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
