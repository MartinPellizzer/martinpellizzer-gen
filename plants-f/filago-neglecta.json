    "intro": "Filago neglecta, commonly known as the common filago, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Filago neglecta typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm and has narrow, linear leaves. It is often considered a weed but can provide habitat for small insects and pollinators."
