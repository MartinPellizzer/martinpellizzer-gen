It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender, branching stems that often trail along the ground. The plant produces small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
