    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. duvalii, commonly known as Duval's sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky and dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has a clump-forming structure that helps it withstand harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and dark green, with a bluish-gray tinge on the underside. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
