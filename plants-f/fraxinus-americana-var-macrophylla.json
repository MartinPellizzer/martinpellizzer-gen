    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. macrophylla, commonly known as the bigleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 10 inches in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in woodland habitats."
