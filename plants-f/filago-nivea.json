It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Filago nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting early pollinators in its native habitat."
