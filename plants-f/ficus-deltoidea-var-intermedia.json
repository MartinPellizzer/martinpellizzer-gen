    "intro": "Ficus deltoidea var. intermedia, commonly known as the Variegated Fiddle-leaf Fig, is a cultivar of the fiddle-leaf fig plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and cream hues. The plant has a robust, upright growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
