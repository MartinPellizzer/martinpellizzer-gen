    "intro": "Forrestia mollissima f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf forestiera, is a compact evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. Its leaves are typically smooth and glossy, with a deep green color that provides year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability in Mediterranean climate zones."
