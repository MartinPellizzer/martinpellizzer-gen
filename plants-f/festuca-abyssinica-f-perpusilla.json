    "intro": "Festuca abyssinica f. perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf Abyssinian fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
