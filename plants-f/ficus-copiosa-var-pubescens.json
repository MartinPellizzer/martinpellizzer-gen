    "intro": "Ficus copiosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, with leaves that are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green or yellow when mature, and it thrives in humid, warm climates with indirect light. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties. Ficus copiosa var. pubescens is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
