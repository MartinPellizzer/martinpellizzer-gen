    "intro": "Fragaria viridis proles hagenbachiana, commonly known as the Hagenbach's green strawberry, is a rare variant of the green strawberry plant. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and pale green fruits that resemble those of the common strawberry. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has a low-growing habit and produces runners that can form dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists."
