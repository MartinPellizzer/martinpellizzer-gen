    "intro": "Fuchsia hirtella, commonly known as the velvetleaf fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from deep pink to violet. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
