    "intro": "Fragaria vesca f. crenata, commonly known as the crested strawberry, is a botanical variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves and small, edible berries that are often less sweet than those of the typical strawberry. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. It has a short growing season and is valued for its ornamental appeal as well as its edible fruits. The crested strawberry is a rare and charming member of the Rosaceae family."
