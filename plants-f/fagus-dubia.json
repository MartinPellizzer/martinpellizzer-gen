    "intro": "Fagus dubia, commonly known as the rare or ghostly beech, is a lesser-known species within the beech family (Fagaceae). It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, cup-shaped fruits called cupules, which contain edible nuts. Fagus dubia is native to specific regions in East Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
