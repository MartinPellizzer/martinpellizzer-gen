It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-resistant. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
