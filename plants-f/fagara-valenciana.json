It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its roots are the primary part used, valued for their starchy texture and medicinal properties. Fagara valenciana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
