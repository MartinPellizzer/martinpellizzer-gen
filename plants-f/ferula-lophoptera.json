It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and they contain a resinous substance used in traditional medicine. Ferula lophoptera is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
