    "intro": "Fagus cochleata, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, triangular samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its wood is dense and durable, historically used for furniture and cooperage. The American beech also provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
