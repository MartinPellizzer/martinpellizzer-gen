    "intro": "Ficus aggregata, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Ficus aggregata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
