    "intro": "Foullioya racemosa, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It is typically found in sandy or disturbed soils in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a subject of ecological interest."
