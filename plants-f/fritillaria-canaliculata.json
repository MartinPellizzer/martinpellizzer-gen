    "intro": "Fritillaria canaliculata, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with purple or brown markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at high altitudes. Fritillaria canaliculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
