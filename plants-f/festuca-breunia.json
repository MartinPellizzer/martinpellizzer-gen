    "intro": "Festuca breunia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Festuca breunia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
