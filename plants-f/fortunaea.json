    "intro": "Fortunaea, commonly known as the glorybower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Oleaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their fragrant, yellow or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Their leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a slightly rough texture. Fortunaea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
