    "intro": "Fragmosa nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in the spring and are pollinated primarily by insects."
