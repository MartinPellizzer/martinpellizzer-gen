    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. flavida, commonly known as the golden sheep's fescue, is a hemicryptophytic perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale yellow to golden florets, giving it its distinctive appearance. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a low-maintenance ground cover. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
