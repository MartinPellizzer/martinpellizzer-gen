    "intro": "Ficus blepharophylla, commonly known as the silver fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ease of care. Ficus blepharophylla prefers indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
