    "intro": "Festuca carazana, commonly known as Carazan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca carazana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
