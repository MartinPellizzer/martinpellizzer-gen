    "intro": "Ferdinandusa goudotiana var. psilocarpa, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections. However, due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is not commonly found in the wild."
