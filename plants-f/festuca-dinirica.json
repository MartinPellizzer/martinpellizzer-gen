    "intro": "Festuca dinirica, commonly known as Diniric fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca dinirica is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient species. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity in its habitat."
