    "intro": "Festuca boriana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to cold, mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers. Festuca boriana is adapted to harsh conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil, making it a resilient species in its habitat. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in alpine ecosystems."
