    "intro": "Festuca picoeuropeana, commonly known as the European mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Festuca picoeuropeana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine flora and fauna."
