    "intro": "Fritillaria ophioglossifolia, commonly known as the snake's tongue fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns resembling a snake's tongue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs are covered in a fibrous tunic. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
