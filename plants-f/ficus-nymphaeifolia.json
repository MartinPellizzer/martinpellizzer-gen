    "intro": "Ficus nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water fig or sacred fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are often submerged in water, which is why it is commonly found in wetlands and marshy areas. The species is also known for its ability to tolerate both aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions."
