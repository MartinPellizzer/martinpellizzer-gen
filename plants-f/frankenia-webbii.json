    "intro": "Frankenia webbii, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia webbii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
