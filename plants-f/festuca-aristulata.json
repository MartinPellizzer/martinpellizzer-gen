    "intro": "Festuca aristulata, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca aristulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
