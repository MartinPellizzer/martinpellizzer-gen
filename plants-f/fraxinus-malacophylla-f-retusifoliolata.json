    "intro": "Fraxinus malacophylla f. retusifoliolata, commonly known as the smooth-leafed ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. This plant exhibits lanceolate leaves with a smooth margin, differing from the typical serrated edges of the species. The leaves are often broader and more rounded at the base, giving them a unique appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The botanical features of this form make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
