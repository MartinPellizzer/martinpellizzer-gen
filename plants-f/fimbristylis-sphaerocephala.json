It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, spherical inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. Fimbristylis sphaerocephala is typically short-lived and has a limited distribution, making it a rare and specialized species."
