    "intro": "Festuca fuegiana, commonly known as the Magellanic bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold, maritime climates and is often found in coastal and high-altitude environments. Festuca fuegiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in temperate regions."
