    "intro": "Fritillaria linophylla, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Fritillaria linophylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
