    "intro": "Freziera suberosa, commonly known as the red-flowered freziera, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Freziera suberosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
