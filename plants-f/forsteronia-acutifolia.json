    "intro": "Forsteronia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved forsteria, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to South America. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
