    "intro": "Ficus erecta var. sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its glossy, dark green, waxy leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is a popular indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. The varietal form, sieboldii, is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other Ficus species."
