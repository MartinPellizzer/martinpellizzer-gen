    "intro": "Fagus \u00d7 moesiaca var. dawycki, commonly known as the Dawyck beech, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Fagus sylvatica and Fagus orientalis. It is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with a doubly serrated margin. The tree produces small, clustered, light yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, triangular nuts. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
