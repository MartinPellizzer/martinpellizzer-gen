    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature cactus or dwarf cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. This plant is characterized by its small, globular shape and dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the axils of the spines. Frailea pygmaea is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil to thrive."
