    "intro": "Fraxinus griffithii var. koshunensis, commonly known as the Koshun ash, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, grayish bark. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
