    "intro": "Fritillaria eggeri, commonly known as the Alpine fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting black markings. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to endure cold winters and dry summers. Fritillaria eggeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
