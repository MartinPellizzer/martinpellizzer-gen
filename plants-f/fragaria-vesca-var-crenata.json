    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. crenata, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its botanical features make it a popular subject in horticultural and ecological studies."
