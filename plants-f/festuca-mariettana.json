    "intro": "Festuca mariettana, commonly known as Marietta's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca mariettana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
