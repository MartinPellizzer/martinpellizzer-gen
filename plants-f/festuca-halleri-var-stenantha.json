It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
