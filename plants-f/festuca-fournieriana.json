    "intro": "Festuca fournieriana, commonly known as Fournier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca fournieriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
