    "intro": "Frangula dianthes, commonly known as the common fumitory, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Frangula dianthes is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
