    "intro": "Ficus storckii var. pubescens, commonly known as the woolly ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish color. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a distinctive addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
