It is characterized by its trailing stems that can climb and twine around supports, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a delicate touch to gardens. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Fischeria scandens thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-draining soil."
