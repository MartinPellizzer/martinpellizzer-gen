    "intro": "Festuca plebeia, commonly known as common bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted blades with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Festuca plebeia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
