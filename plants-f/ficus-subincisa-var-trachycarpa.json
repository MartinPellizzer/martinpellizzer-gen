It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and rough-textured leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit, a small, greenish fig, develops from the flowers and is edible. This species is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
