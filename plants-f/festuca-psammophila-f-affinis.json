    "intro": "Festuca psammophila f. affinis, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a grass species characterized by its adaptation to arid and sandy environments. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as dunes and coastal areas, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well-suited to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
