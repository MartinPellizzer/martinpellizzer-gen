    "intro": "Frankenia pauciflora var. paleacea, commonly known as the pale sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it useful for erosion control. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in harsh climates."
