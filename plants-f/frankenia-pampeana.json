    "intro": "Frankenia pampeana, commonly known as the Pampas frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the Pampas region of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Frankenia pampeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging ecological conditions."
