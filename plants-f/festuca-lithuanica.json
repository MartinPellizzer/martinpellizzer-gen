It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, soft foliage. Festuca lithuanica is also known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
