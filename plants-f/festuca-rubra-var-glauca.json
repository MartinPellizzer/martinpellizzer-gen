    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. glauca, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades with a bluish sheen, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in landscaping and turfgrass applications. Festuca rubra var. glauca is also known for its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps that can withstand light foot traffic."
