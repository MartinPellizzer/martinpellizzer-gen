    "intro": "Festuca bracteata, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, sod-like stands. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple florets, which are distinctive in appearance. Festuca bracteata plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
