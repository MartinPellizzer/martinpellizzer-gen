    "intro": "Fumaria judaica, commonly known as the Jewish smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, featuring slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Fumaria judaica is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
