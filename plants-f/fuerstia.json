    "intro": "Fuerstia, commonly known as the \"Mexican orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants typically feature showy, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Fuerstia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on humid environments for survival. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological role in their native habitats."
