    "intro": "Fumana vulgaris, commonly known as the common fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Fumaria vulgaris is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its preference for partial to full sunlight. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and tonic properties."
