    "intro": "Fedia cornucopiae var. scorpioides, commonly known as the Scorpioid Fedia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bioluminescent leaves that glow in the dark, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep indigo to fiery orange, depending on the time of day. Its unique morphology includes a central stem that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an endangered species."
