    "intro": "Fimbristylis cymosa subsp. cymosa, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, showcasing its adaptability to moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it lacks true leaves, instead having reduced, scale-like structures. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
