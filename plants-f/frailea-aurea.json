    "intro": "Frailea aurea, commonly known as the golden frailea, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, compact plant with short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
