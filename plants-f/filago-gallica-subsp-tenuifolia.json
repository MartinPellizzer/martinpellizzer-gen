It typically grows in grassy areas and along woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. This subspecies is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local insect populations."
