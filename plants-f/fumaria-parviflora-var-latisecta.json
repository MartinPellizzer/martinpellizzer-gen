    "intro": "Fumaria parviflora var. latisecta, commonly known as the broad-leafed yellowweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their four petals and a distinctive, spurred structure at the base. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
