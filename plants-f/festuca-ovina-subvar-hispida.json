    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. hispida, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. This subspecies is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
