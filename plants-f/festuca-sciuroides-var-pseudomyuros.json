    "intro": "Festuca sciuroides var. pseudomyuros, commonly known as the blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which make it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is a valuable species for ecological restoration and ornamental landscaping."
