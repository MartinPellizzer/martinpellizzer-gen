    "intro": "Fimbristylis trichophylla var. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is typically found in wet or marshy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The inflorescence consists of numerous tiny flowers that are often wind-pollinated."
