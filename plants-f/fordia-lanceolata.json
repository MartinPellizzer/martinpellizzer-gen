    "intro": "Fordia lanceolata, commonly known as the winter honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, deciduous leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Fordia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and early spring bloom."
