    "intro": "Fimbristylis littoralis var. koidzumiana, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or saline environments such as tidal flats and mangrove swamps. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a fibrous, rhizomatous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spikes, and it produces small, dry seeds that are dispersed by water. This species is adapted to brackish conditions and plays a role in coastal ecosystem dynamics."
