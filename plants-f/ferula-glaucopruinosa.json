    "intro": "Ferula glaucopruinosa, commonly known as the glaucous ferula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ferula glaucopruinosa is adapted to arid environments, with a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss."
