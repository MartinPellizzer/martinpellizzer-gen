    "intro": "Freziera roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima freziera, is a rare and striking plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in shaded, humid environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
