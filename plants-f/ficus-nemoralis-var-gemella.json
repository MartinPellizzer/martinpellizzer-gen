    "intro": "Ficus nemoralis var. gemella, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a species native to parts of Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Ficus nemoralis. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The varietal form gemella is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and compact growth habit."
