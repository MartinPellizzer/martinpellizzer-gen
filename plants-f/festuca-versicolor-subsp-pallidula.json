    "intro": "Festuca versicolor subsp. pallidula, commonly known as the pale bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
