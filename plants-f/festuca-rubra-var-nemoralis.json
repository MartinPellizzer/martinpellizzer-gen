It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and clusters of purple or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands, moors, and woodland edges. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens with moist, shaded conditions."
