    "intro": "Ficus abbreviata, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its small, thick, and waxy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not for humans. Ficus abbreviata is often grown as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
