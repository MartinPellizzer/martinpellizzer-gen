    "intro": "Festuca greuteri, commonly known as Greuter's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca greuteri is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its low-growing form and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for landscaping in dry, well-drained soils."
