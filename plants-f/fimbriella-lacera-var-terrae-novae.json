    "intro": "Fimbriella lacera var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Terra Nova fimbriella, is a rare and delicate algal species belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its thin, ribbon-like thallus that often exhibits a bluish-green coloration. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich coastal waters, where it attaches to rocky substrates. Its morphology includes a distinctive fringed margin, which gives it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
