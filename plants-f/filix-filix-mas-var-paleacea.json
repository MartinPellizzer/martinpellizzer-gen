It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are finely divided and feathery in appearance. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are typically creeping and help in spreading the plant across the ground. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
