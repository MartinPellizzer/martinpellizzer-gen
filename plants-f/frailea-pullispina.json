    "intro": "Frailea pullispina, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear clusters of vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces bright red, orange, or yellow blooms during the holiday season, hence its common name. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. Frailea pullispina prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
