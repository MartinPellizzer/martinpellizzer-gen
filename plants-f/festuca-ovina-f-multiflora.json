    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. multiflora, commonly known as the multi-flowered sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically produces multiple flowering shoots, contributing to its name, and it has a mat-forming growth pattern that helps stabilize soil. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, and it is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
