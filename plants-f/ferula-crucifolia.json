    "intro": "Ferula crucifolia, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its taproot is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula crucifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
