    "intro": "Festuca spiciformis, commonly known as the spike-form fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescence that consists of closely packed spikelets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Festuca spiciformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
