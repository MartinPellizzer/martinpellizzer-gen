    "intro": "Festuca lanifera, commonly known as the downy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, soft foliage covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms low, compact clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Festuca lanifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
