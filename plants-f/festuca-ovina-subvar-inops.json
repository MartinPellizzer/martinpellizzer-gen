    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. inops, commonly known as the slender sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and serving as forage for grazing animals."
