It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits composed of multiple achenes. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its fruit is edible, though smaller and less sweet than the cultivated strawberry."
