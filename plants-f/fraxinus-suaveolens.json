It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a slightly hairy underside. Its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, winged fruits. Sweet ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
