    "intro": "Ficus marquesensis, commonly known as the Marquesan fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
