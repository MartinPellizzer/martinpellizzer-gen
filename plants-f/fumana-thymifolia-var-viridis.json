    "intro": "Fumana thymifolia var. viridis, commonly known as green thyme, is a variant of the thyme plant characterized by its aromatic, green foliage. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, needle-like leaves that emit a strong, pleasant scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
