    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. vivipara, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both sterile and fertile florets, with the latter containing three stamens and a single pistil. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
