    "intro": "Festuca remota, commonly known as the remote fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca remota thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species in harsh, high-altitude ecosystems."
