    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. marginata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained conditions, making it a hardy ornamental and lawn grass. Its marginal silver-white stripe distinguishes it from other fescue varieties, adding visual interest to gardens and landscapes."
