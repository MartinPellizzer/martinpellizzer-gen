    "intro": "Festuca baltica, commonly known as Baltic fescue, is a perennial grass native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. Festuca baltica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
