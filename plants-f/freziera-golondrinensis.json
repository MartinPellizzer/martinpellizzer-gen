    "intro": "Freziera golondrinensis, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of South America. This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
