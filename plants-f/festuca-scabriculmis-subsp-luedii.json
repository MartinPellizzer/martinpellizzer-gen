    "intro": "Festuca scabriculmis subsp. luedii, commonly known as the Luedii fescue, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in temperate climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, scabrous texture along the lower surface, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
