    "intro": "Furcraea cabuya, commonly known as the Cabuya plant, is a succulent species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy surface, and they can grow quite large, reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. This plant is also known for its ability to produce tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in arid and semi-arid climates."
