    "intro": "Festuca lenensis, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear\u9896\u679c, which are dry, one-seeded fruits. Festuca lenensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude and arctic ecosystems."
