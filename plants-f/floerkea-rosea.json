    "intro": "Floerkea rosea, commonly known as the pink glorybower, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color."
