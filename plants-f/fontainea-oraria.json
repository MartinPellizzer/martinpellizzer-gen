    "intro": "Fontainea oraria, commonly known as the white-flowered flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing seeds. Fontainea oraria thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
