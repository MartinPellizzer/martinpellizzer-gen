    "intro": "Ficus mesotes, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ficus mesotes is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
