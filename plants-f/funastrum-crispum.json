    "intro": "Funastrum crispum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, waxy secretions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Funastrum crispum is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
