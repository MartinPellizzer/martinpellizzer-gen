    "intro": "Ficus theophrastoides var. theophrastoides, commonly known as the Chinese banyan, is a large evergreen tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative tree due to its rapid growth and ability to form aerial roots. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
