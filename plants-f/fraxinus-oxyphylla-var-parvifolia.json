    "intro": "Fraxinus oxyphylla var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a finely serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
