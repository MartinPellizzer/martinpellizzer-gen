    "intro": "Frankenia ericifolia subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in small, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Frankenia ericifolia subsp. montana is often found in coastal bluffs, slopes, and other dry, sunny habitats."
