    "intro": "Ferocactus melocactiformis, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
