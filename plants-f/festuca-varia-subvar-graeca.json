    "intro": "Festuca varia subvar. graeca, commonly known as Greek variable fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkans and parts of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often slightly hairy. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Festuca varia subvar. graeca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens for its ecological benefits."
