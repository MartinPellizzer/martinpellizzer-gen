    "intro": "Ficus recurva, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches and elongated, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a shallow root system, making it sensitive to changes in its environment, such as temperature and humidity. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. Ficus recurva is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
