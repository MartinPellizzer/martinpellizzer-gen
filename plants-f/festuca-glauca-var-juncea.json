    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. juncea, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense growth habit, which makes it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental gardens. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and forms a mat-like structure, often spreading through rhizomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive color and ability to form a lush, uniform turf."
