    "intro": "Falcaria serrata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and arid conditions. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
