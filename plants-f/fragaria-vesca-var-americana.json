    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. americana, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant bears edible, red, berry-like fruits that develop from the flowers and are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas and along forest edges. This variety is closely related to the common strawberry, Fragaria vesca, but is distinguished by its smaller size and specific geographic distribution."
