    "intro": "Ficus ribes f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig. It is a variant of the common fig, characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form. The plant is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree, native to regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are usually glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. The fruit, while edible, is less commonly consumed than the common fig due to its smaller size and slightly tart flavor."
