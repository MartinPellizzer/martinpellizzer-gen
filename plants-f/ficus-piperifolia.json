    "intro": "Ficus piperifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Ficus piperifolia is often used in horticulture as a ground cover or climbing plant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
