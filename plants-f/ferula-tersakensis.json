    "intro": "Ferula tersakensis, commonly known as the Tersaknsis cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, spicy scent, while its roots are often harvested for their medicinal value. Ferula tersakensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes where it is adapted to harsh climatic conditions."
