    "intro": "Ferula equisetacea, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Ferula equisetacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
