    "intro": "Fragaria suecica, commonly known as the Swedish strawberry, is a wild species of strawberry native to northern Europe. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome system that produces runners. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its fruits are typically smaller and more acidic than those of cultivated strawberries. This species is valued for its genetic potential in breeding programs aimed at improving strawberry varieties."
