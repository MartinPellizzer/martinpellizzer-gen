    "intro": "Ficus stricta, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are enclosed in a spiky, green husk. It has a shallow root system, making it sensitive to changes in its environment, such as overwatering or temperature fluctuations. Ficus stricta is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
