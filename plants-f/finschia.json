    "intro": "Finschia, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species native to the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America, Africa, and Australia. These plants are typically shrubs with small, leathery leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Finschia species are adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in high-altitude or arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
