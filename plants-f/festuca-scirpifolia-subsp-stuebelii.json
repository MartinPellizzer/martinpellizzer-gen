    "intro": "Festuca scirpifolia subsp. stuebelii, commonly known as Stuebel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
