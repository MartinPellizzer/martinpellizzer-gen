    "intro": "Ficus lanata, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a unique appearance. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in dense, soft pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
