    "intro": "Fagara sarasinii, commonly known as the Sarasin's soursop, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are followed by inedible, spiny fruits.
