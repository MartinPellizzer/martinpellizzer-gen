    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy valley fescue, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. It is native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it the \"hirta\" designation. This ecotype is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
