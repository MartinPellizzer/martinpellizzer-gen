    "intro": "Festuca fluitans var. loliacea, commonly known as water bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce light blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels contributes to its ecological significance in stabilizing shorelines. However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its low visibility and preference for specific environmental conditions."
