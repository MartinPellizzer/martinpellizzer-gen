    "intro": "Fagonia virens, commonly known as the green fagonia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Fagonia virens is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. It is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
