    "intro": "Festuca eggleri, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Festuca eggleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
