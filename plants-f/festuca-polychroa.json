    "intro": "Festuca polychroa, commonly known as the multicolored fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with various colors, giving it its common name. Festuca polychroa is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
