    "intro": "Ficus thelephora, commonly known as the dwarf rubber fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fruit. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's latex sap, like that of other ficus species, can be toxic if ingested."
