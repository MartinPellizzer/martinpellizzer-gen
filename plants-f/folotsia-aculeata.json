    "intro": "Folotsia aculeata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss through transpiration. The fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine."
