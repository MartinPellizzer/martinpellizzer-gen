    "intro": "Festuca jeanpertii subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender meadow fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
