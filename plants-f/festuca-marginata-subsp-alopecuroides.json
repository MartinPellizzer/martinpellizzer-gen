    "intro": "Festuca marginata subsp. alopecuroides, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes, thriving in coastal environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
