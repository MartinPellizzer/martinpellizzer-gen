    "intro": "Fimbristylis quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps, bogs, and rice fields. The plant has slender, triangular stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Fimbristylis quinquangularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
