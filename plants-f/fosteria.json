These plants are characterized by their fragrant, often tubular or clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Fosteria species typically have small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery or grayish pubescence. They are shrubs or small trees that thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual and aromatic qualities."
