    "intro": "Ficus aurata var. brevipilosa, commonly known as the dwarf ficus or compact fig tree, is a compact, shrub-like plant with thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant has a dense foliage structure, making it ideal for indoor cultivation due to its ability to tolerate low light conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by edible fruits, although the plant is primarily grown for its ornamental value. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain its health and appearance."
