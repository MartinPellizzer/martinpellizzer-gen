It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its pale flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
