It features small, delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in humid climates."
