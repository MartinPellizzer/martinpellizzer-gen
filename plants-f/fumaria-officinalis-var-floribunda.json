    "intro": "Fumaria officinalis var. floribunda, commonly known as the flowering yellowweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, nodding flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by slender, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields."
