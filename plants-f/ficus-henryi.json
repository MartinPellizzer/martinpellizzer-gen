    "intro": "Ficus henryi, commonly known as the Henry fig or the Chinese rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically broad and ovate. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Ficus henryi is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
