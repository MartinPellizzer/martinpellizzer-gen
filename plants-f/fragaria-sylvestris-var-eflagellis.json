    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. eflagellis, commonly known as the silverleaf strawberry, is a rare variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage that distinguishes it from typical strawberry plants. The leaves are trifoliate, with a dense pubescence that gives them a distinctive appearance. It produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is similar to the common strawberry but has a more delicate flavor and a smaller size."
