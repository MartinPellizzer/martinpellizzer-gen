    "intro": "Ficus ramentacea, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or green in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus ramentacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
