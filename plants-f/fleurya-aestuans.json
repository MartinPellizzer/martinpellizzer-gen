It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Fleurya aestuans is often found in dune environments and is considered an indicator species of coastal ecosystems."
