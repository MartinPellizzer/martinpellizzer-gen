    "intro": "Festuca pumila, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Festuca pumila is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
