    "intro": "Ficus parasitica subsp. gibbosa, commonly known as the giant fig vine, is a hemi-parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant attaches itself to host trees using aerial roots, deriving water and nutrients from its host while still performing photosynthesis. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are an important food source for various animals. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
