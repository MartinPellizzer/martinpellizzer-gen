    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. major, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and coarse, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
