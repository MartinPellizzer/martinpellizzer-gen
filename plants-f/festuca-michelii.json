    "intro": "Festuca michelii, commonly known as Michel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca michelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid landscapes."
