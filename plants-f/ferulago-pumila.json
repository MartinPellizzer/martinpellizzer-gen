    "intro": "Ferulago pumila, commonly known as the dwarf cow-wheat, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots are adapted to thrive in rocky or dry soils, and it is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats. Ferulago pumila is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
