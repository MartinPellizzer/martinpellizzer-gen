    "intro": "Faramea contracta, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host plants for nutrients, primarily members of the Rubiaceae family. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to many animals. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the berries and excrete the seeds onto new host plants. Faramea contracta plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
