    "intro": "Fagaropsis hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's fagaropsis, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the rugged terrain of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
