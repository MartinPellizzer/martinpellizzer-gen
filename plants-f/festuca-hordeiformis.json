    "intro": "Festuca hordeiformis, commonly known as the yellow false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to brownish flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh mountain conditions. Festuca hordeiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
