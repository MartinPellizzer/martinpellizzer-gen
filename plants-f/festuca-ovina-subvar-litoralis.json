    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. litoralis, commonly known as coastal sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its resilience makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
