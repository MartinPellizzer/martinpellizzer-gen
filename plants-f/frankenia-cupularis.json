    "intro": "Frankenia cupularis, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is a low-growing shrub with small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along dunes and coastal bluffs. Frankenia cupularis is adapted to salt spray and high winds, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
