    "intro": "Fragaria vescocollina, commonly known as the sweet-scented strawberry, is a rare and lesser-known species of the strawberry genus. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries with a unique, sweet aroma that sets it apart from other strawberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare botanical specimen of interest to horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
