    "intro": "Fockea, commonly known as the starfish flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers. Fockea species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and opposite leaves. The flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink, and are borne in clusters. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
