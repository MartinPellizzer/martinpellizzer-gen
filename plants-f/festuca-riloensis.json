    "intro": "Festuca riloensis, commonly known as the Riloan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca riloensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
