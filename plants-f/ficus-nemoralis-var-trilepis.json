    "intro": "Ficus nemoralis var. trilepis, commonly known as the three-lobed fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are distinctly three-lobed. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically enclosed in a fleshy, greenish receptacle. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
