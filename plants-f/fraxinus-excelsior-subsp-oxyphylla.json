    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior subsp. oxyphylla, commonly known as the European bird cherry, is a subspecies of the common ash native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, pale yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, and they turn a striking orange-red in autumn. The fruit is a small, two-valved samara that disperses seeds by wind. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
