    "intro": "Ferula pisidica, commonly known as the Crimean cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fibrous. Ferula pisidica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
