It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, often reddish-tinged foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
