    "intro": "Ficus grossivenis, commonly known as the giant ficus or large-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus grossivenis is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
