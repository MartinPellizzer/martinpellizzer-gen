    "intro": "Folliculigera coerulea, commonly known as the blue follicle orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique blue-violet floral bracts, which are not petals but specialized structures that resemble small, inflated pods. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike that bears several clustered, showy bracts, each containing a tiny, delicate orchid-like bloom. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact, herbaceous stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native environment."
