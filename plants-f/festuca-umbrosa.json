    "intro": "Festuca umbrosa, commonly known as shadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca umbrosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
