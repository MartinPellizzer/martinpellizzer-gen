    "intro": "Festuca sylvatica var. minor, commonly known as woodland bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fine texture and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
