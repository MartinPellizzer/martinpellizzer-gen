    "intro": "Festuca altaica subvar. hallii, commonly known as the Altai fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which contain the flowers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
