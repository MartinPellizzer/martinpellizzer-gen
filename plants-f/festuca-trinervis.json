It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The leaves are typically narrow with a prominent central vein and three secondary veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
