    "intro": "Fraxinus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks."
