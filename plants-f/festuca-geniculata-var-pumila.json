It features fine, silver-gray foliage and produces slender, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant habitats."
