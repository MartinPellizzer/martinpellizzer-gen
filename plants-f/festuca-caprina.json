    "intro": "Festuca caprina, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows, pastures, and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers. Festuca caprina is often used as forage for livestock due to its hardy nature and nutritional value. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a common weed in agricultural settings."
