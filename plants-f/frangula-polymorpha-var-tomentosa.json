    "intro": "Frangula polymorpha var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, dark blue berries that are rich in anthraquinones. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving them a silvery appearance. This species is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
