    "intro": "Fagonia bruguieri var. myriacantha, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xeriscaping."
