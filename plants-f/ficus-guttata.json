    "intro": "Ficus guttata, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus guttata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
