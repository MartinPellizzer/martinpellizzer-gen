    "intro": "Fumaria aquilegifolia, commonly known as the water cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams and in damp woodlands. Its seeds are small and dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
