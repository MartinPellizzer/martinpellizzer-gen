    "intro": "Fagelia cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
