It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
