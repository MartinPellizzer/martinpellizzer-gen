    "intro": "Fraxinus globosa, commonly known as the European ash or small-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically 3\u20136 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Fraxinus globosa is relatively slow-growing and can live for several decades, making it a valuable component of mixed forest ecosystems."
