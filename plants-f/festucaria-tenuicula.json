    "intro": "Festucaria tenuicula, commonly known as the sea grass or saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It produces small, inconspicuous blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikes. Festucaria tenuicula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
