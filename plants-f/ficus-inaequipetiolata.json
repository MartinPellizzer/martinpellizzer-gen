    "intro": "Ficus inaequipetiolata, commonly known as the unequal-petioled fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, and is characterized by its unique leaf structure, where the petioles (leaf stems) vary in length. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy green surface and a slightly waxy texture. This plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are generally not consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
