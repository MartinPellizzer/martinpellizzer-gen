    "intro": "Festuca pohleana, commonly known as Pohlean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pohleana is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
