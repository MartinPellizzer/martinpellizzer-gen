    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and erosion control capabilities. Festuca ovina subvar. hirsuta is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in marginal conditions."
