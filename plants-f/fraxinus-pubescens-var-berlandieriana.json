It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are hairy on the underside. The small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
