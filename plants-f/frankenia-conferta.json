    "intro": "Frankenia conferta, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia conferta is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
