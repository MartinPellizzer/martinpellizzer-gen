    "intro": "Fagus aspleniifolia, commonly known as the silver fagus, is a species of beech native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a silvery or pale green pubescence. The plant typically grows in cool, moist, shaded environments, often forming dense stands in forest understories. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Fagus aspleniifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
