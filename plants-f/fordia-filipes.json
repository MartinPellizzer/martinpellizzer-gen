    "intro": "Fordia filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf maple, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to woodland gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade."
