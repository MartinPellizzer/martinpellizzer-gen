It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. The plant has a shallow root system and is relatively fast-growing compared to other hardwoods."
