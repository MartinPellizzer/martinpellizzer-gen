    "intro": "Ficus lanata var. foveolata, commonly known as the woolly fig or foveolate ficus, is a tropical plant characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. Its leaves are thick, waxy, and covered in a fine, soft pubescence that gives it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus lanata var. foveolata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique texture and foliage."
