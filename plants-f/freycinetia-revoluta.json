    "intro": "Freycinetia revoluta, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spadices, which are leaf-like bracts. Its fibrous leaves have been historically used by M\u0101ori for making clothing, ropes, and other crafts. Freycinetia revoluta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in native ecosystems."
