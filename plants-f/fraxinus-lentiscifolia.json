    "intro": "Fraxinus lentiscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive, finely serrated leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. The bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to exfoliate, revealing a lighter inner layer."
