    "intro": "Fraxinus brandisii, commonly known as Brandis' ash, is a species of ash native to parts of Central and Southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are borne in catkins and appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, winged fruits that disperse by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
