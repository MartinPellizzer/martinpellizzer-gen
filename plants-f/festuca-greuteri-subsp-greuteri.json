    "intro": "Festuca greuteri subsp. greuteri, commonly known as Greuter's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. The plant features tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and low nutrient soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
