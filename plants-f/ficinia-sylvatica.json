    "intro": "Ficinia sylvatica, commonly known as the forest ficinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and are usually white or pale green. Ficinia sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
