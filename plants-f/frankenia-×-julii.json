    "intro": "Frankenia \u00d7 julii, commonly known as the coastal ironwood, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to sandy, saline soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia \u00d7 julii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
