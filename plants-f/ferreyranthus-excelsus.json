It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
