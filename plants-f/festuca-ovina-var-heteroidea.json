    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. heteroidea, commonly known as woolly bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, woolly appearance, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca ovina var. heteroidea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
