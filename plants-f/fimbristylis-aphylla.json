    "intro": "Fimbristylis aphylla, commonly known as the hairless spikegrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it lacks the tuft of hairs at the base of the flowering stems, giving it its common name. Fimbristylis aphylla is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas."
