    "intro": "Fraxinus pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and hardiness."
