It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
