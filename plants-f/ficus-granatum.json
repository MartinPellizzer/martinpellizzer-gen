    "intro": "Ficus granatum, commonly known as the Indian fig or red date tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to South Asia. It is characterized by its thick, smooth, reddish-brown bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, red or yellow berries that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
