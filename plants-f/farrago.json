    "intro": "Farrago, commonly known as the wild garlic or wild leek, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are edible and resemble garlic or onions in taste. Farrago is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded areas. It is valued both for its culinary use and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
