    "intro": "Ficus radicans var. brevifolia, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that hang in cascading clusters, giving it a distinctive, waterfall-like appearance. The leaves are typically glossy, ovate, and dark green, with a leathery texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and aesthetic appeal."
