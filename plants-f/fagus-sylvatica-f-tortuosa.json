    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted beech, is a unique variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its contorted, gnarled trunk and branches, which give it a distinctive, almost sculptural appearance. This form arises due to natural mutations or environmental stress, leading to the development of twisted growth patterns. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and glossy, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. While it is not a cultivated variety, it is often found in wild populations and is highly valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
