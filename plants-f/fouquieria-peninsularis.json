    "intro": "Fouquieria peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, succulent stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has a unique ability to shed its leaves during drought periods, allowing it to conserve water. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems. Fouquieria peninsularis is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is a symbol of the desert's resilience."
