    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, carpet-like sods. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or open areas. Its flowering stems bear spikelets with small, blue-green florets, which are characteristic of the Festuca genus. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and conservation efforts."
