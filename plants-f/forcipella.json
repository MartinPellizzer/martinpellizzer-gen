    "intro": "Forcipella, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, elongated body and often vibrant coloration, which can serve as a warning to predators. Forcipella species typically inhabit shallow coastal waters and are found in tropical and temperate regions worldwide. They possess a unique structure called the radula, used for feeding on algae and other plant matter. Additionally, some species of Forcipella are known to secrete a toxic substance, which can be harmful to other marine life."
