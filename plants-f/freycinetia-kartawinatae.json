It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
