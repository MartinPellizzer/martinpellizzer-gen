    "intro": "Ficus scleroptera, commonly known as the hard-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically leathery in texture and have a distinctive, almost armor-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not palatable to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ficus scleroptera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
