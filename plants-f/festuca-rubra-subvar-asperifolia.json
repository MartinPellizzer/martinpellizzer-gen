    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. asperifolia, commonly known as rough leaf fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
