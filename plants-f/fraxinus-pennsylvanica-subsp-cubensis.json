    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica subsp. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves with opposite, ovate leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems."
