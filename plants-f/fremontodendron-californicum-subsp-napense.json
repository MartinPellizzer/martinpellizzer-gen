It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal bluffs and dunes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to the harsh coastal environment.
