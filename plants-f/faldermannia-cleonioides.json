    "intro": "Faldermannia cleonioides, commonly known as the African morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like capsule that splits open when mature."
