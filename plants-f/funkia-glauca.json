    "intro": "Funkia glauca, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features strap-like, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system. It typically thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes and pond edges. Funkia glauca is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
