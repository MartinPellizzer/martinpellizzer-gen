    "intro": "Festuca balcanica subsp. rhodopensis, commonly known as Rhodope fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
