    "intro": "Festuca chumbiensis, commonly known as the Chumbi fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Festuca chumbiensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
