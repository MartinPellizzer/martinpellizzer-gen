    "intro": "Fagelia scabra var. bartsiifolia, commonly known as the rough fagelia, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white or pale pink petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
