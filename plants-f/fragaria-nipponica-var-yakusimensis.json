    "intro": "Fragaria nipponica var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima strawberry, is a rare and endangered plant native to the island of Yakushima in Japan. It is characterized by its small, red, edible fruits that are typically covered in a white bloom. The plant thrives in the humid, shaded environments of the subtropical forests, where it forms a dense mat on the forest floor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are covered in fine, woolly hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
