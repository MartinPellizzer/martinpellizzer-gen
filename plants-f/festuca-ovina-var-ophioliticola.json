    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. ophioliticola, commonly known as the Ophiolitic Meadowgrass, is a variant of the sheep's fescue that thrives in specific ecological niches. This plant is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and typically grows in compact, dense tufts. It is adapted to rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The species exhibits a low-growing habit with narrow leaves and is often found in association with other alpine flora. Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing soils in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
