    "intro": "Ficus suberosa, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when mature. Ficus suberosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
