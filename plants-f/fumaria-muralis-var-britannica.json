    "intro": "Fumaria muralis var. britannica, commonly known as the British wallbine, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly Britain. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as walls, rubble, and along paths, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. It is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
