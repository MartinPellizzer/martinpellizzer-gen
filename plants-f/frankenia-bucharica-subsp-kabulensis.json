    "intro": "Frankenia bucharica subsp. kabulensis, commonly known as the Afghan firebush, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of bright orange-red flowers during the summer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh climates."
