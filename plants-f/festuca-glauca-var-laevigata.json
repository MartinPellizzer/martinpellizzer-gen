    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a neat appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and forms dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Its foliage remains green throughout the growing season, providing year-round visual interest in landscapes."
