    "intro": "Fritillaria rhodocanakis, commonly known as the Greek fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, making it a notable addition to alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
