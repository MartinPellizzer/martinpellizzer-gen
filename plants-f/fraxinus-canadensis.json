It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its fruit. The tree is often found in moist soils along rivers and in floodplain forests."
