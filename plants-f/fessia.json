    "intro": "Fessia, commonly known as the silverleaf fessia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Fessia species are native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
