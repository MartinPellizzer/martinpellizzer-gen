    "intro": "Fouha bulbocodioides, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its clustered, yellowish flowers and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. Fouha bulbocodioides is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to conserve water. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
