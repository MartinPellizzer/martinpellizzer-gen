    "intro": "Ficus binnendykii var. cupulata, commonly known as the cupulata fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
