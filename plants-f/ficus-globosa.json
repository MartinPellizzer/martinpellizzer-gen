    "intro": "Ficus globosa, commonly known as the globular fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spherical shape and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are typically consumed by birds and other animals. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ficus globosa is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
