    "intro": "Fimbristylis interior, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy areas of eastern Australia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes, lake margins, and along waterways. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
