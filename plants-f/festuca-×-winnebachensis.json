    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 winnebachensis, commonly known as the Winnebach reedgrass, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as lawns, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
