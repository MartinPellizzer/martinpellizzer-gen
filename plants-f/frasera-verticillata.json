    "intro": "Frasera verticillata, commonly known as the western parsnip, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. The plant has a stout, branching stem that often grows up to 1 meter in height, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, forming a distinctive, showy inflorescence with white to pale pink petals. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
