    "intro": "Freziera arbutifolia, commonly known as the evergreen honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
