    "intro": "Ficus remifolia, commonly known as the silver fig or creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or ornamental plant in gardens. Ficus remifolia is also popular in interior landscaping due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
