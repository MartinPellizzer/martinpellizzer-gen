    "intro": "Flaveria trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined flaveria, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
