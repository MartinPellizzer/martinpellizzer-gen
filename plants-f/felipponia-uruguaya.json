    "intro": "Felipponia uruguaya, commonly known as the Uruguayan fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Uruguay. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Felipponia uruguaya is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
