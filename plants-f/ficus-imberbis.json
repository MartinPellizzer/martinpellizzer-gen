    "intro": "Ficus imberbis, commonly known as the smooth-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, smooth, dark green leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may turn reddish or purple depending on the variety. Ficus imberbis thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
