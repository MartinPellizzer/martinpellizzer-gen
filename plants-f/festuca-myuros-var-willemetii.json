    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. willemetii, commonly known as Willemetii Meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
