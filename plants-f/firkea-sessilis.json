    "intro": "Firkea sessilis, commonly known as the sessile firkea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Firkea sessilis is often found in moist, shaded environments, thriving in rocky or forested areas."
