    "intro": "Ficus mafuluensis, commonly known as the Mafulu fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other well-known fig species. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into edible fig fruits. Ficus mafuluensis typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
