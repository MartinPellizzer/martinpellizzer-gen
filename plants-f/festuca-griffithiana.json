    "intro": "Festuca griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca griffithiana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing lawns."
