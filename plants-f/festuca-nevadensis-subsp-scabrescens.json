    "intro": "Festuca nevadensis subsp. scabrescens, commonly known as the Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in restoration projects and as a groundcover in arid landscapes."
