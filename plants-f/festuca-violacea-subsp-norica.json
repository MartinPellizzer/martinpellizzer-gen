    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. norica, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and features dark blue to purple flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds to its ornamental appeal. Festuca violacea subsp. norica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
