    "intro": "Festuca javorkae, commonly known as the Javorka fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, compact clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in poor, rocky soils and cold climates."
