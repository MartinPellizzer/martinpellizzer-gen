    "intro": "Festuca deserticola, commonly known as desert grass or desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca deserticola plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
