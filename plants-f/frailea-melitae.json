    "intro": "Frailea melitae, commonly known as the Maltese rock cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Mediterranean island of Malta. It is a small, compact plant that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features a short, branched stem covered in dense, white to pale green areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
