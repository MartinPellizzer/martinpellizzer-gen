    "intro": "Festuca luciarum, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs on its leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca luciarum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique texture and color."
