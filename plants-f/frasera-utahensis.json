The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight pubescence, while its stems are woody and branching. Utah frasera is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
