    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. glabra, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and turfgrass. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy areas. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth helps it form a dense, hardy sod."
