    "intro": "Festuca pungens var. chlorantha, commonly known as the Blue Oat Grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, blue-green foliage that forms dense, mat-like clumps, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, airy plumes of silver-blue flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its fine texture and color make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
