    "intro": "Freycinetia agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan freycinetia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests, often growing near streams or in moist, shaded areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
