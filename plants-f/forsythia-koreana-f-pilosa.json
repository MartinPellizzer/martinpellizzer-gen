    "intro": "Forsythia koreana f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy forsythia, is a variant of the Korean forsythia characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to Korea, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces clusters of bright yellow, funnel-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. The hairy foliage and early blooming habit make it a notable ornamental plant in botanical gardens and landscapes."
