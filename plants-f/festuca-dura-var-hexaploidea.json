    "intro": "Festuca dura var. hexaploidea, commonly known as the hexaploid tough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping and restoration projects. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and resilience. Festuca dura var. hexaploidea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
