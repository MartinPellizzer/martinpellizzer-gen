    "intro": "Fragaria nigra, commonly known as blackberry strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, dark red to black berries. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that are often dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor and are sometimes used in culinary applications."
