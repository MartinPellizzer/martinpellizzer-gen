    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. coriariifolia, commonly known as the European ash with coriaria-like leaves, is a rare variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that resemble those of the coriaria plant, giving it its varietal name. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded woodland areas. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage. However, it is vulnerable to ash dieback disease, which has significantly impacted its population."
