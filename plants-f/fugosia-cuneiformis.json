    "intro": "Fugosia cuneiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fugosia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
