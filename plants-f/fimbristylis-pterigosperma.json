    "intro": "Fimbristylis pterigosperma, commonly known as the hairy fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of spikelets at the top of its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often wind-pollinated, and the plant produces distinctive, hairy bracts that give it its common name. Fimbristylis pterigosperma is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and northern Australia."
