    "intro": "Ficus umbrae, commonly known as the shadow fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, providing dense shade beneath the canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by inedible, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid environments with high levels of indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
