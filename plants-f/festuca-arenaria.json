    "intro": "Festuca arenaria, commonly known as sand fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with poor nutrients. It is often found in coastal dunes and mountainous areas where it helps stabilize soil. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
