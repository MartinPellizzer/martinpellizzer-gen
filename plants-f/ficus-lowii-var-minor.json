    "intro": "Ficus lowii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rubber fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid conditions. Due to its slow growth and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
