    "intro": "Ficus squamellosa, commonly known as the warty fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, warty bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus squamellosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
