    "intro": "Fraxinus platycarpa, commonly known as the flat-fruit ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that mature to a dark brown color. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is less commonly used than other ash species. The plant has limited horticultural use but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and geographic distribution."
