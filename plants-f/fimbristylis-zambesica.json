    "intro": "Fimbristylis zambesica, commonly known as the Zambesi flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment. Fimbristylis zambesica is native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Zambia and Zimbabwe."
