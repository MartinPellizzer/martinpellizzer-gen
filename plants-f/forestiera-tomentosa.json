    "intro": "Forestiera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense, white pubescence, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
