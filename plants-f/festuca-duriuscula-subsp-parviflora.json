    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted to wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Festuca duriuscula subsp. parviflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
