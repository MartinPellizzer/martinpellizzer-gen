    "intro": "Festuca amethystina f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous bluegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally smooth and hairless, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and color."
