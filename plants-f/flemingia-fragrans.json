    "intro": "Flemingia fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant flemingia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value. Flemingia fragrans is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
