It belongs to the genus Fagus, which includes other beech species found in temperate regions. The tree is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and oval-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. It produces small, spiky samaras as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Fagus engleriana typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
