    "intro": "Ficus dictyophylla, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, spherical fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. Ficus dictyophylla is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its ornamental value. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and attach to surfaces, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
