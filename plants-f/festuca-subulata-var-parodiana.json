    "intro": "Festuca subulata var. parodiana, commonly known as the Parodi's sedge, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its foliage is usually silver-gray due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
