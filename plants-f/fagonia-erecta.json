    "intro": "Fagonia erecta, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Fagonia erecta is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
