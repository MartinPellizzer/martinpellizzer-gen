    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana, commonly known as the pond cedar, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found along the edges of swamps and ponds. Its adaptability to moist soils makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
