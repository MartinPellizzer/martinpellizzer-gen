    "intro": "Festuca serpentinica, commonly known as serpentine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to rocky, nutrient-poor soils. It is particularly adapted to grow in serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals and low in essential nutrients. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
