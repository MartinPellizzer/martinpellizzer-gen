    "intro": "Ferolia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-horned fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ferolia coriacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
