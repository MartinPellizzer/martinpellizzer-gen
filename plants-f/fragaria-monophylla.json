    "intro": "Fragaria monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf strawberry, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being ovate and pubescent. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red and slightly tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
