    "intro": "Ficus malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Ficus malabarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
