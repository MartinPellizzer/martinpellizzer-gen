    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a hardy grass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh alpine conditions. This variety is typically found in high-altitude environments such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its adaptability to cold climates and poor soils makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its propagation in challenging habitats."
