    "intro": "Flueggea nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf flueggea, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Flueggea nitida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
