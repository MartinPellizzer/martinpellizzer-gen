    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated ash or the jagged ash, is a variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its finely toothed, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically longer and more deeply lobed compared to the typical form of Fraxinus excelsior. This form thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras."
