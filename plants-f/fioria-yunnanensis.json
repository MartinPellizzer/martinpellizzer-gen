    "intro": "Fioria yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fioria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its ornamental, small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are usually elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fioria yunnanensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
