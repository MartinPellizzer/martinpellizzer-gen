It features a cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and produces small, white to pink flowers during the warmer months. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its unique morphology and hardy nature make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
