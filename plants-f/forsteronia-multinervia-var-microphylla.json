    "intro": "Forsteronia multinervia var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leafed forsteria, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
