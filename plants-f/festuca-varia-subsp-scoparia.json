    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. scoparia, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and colonize various habitats. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and turfgrass applications."
