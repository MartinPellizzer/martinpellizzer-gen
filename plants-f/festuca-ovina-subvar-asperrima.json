    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. asperrima, commonly known as rough sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its deep root system helps it survive in poor soils and withstand drought. Festuca ovina subvar. asperrima is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along disturbed sites such as roadsides and railway embankments."
