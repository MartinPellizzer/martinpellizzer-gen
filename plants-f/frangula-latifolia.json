    "intro": "Frangula latifolia, commonly known as American buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is known for its high concentration of anthraquinones, which are used in the production of laxatives. Its berries, which are dark purple when mature, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Frangula latifolia typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to 15 feet."
