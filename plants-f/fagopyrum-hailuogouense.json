    "intro": "Fagopyrum hailuogouense, commonly known as the Hailuogou buckwheat, is a rare and endemic species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and distinctive yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that transition into triangular, edible seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
