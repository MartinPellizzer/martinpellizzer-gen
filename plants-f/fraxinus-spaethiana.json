    "intro": "Fraxinus spaethiana, commonly known as the Spaeth's ash, is a rare and critically endangered species native to a small region in southern Germany. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender trunk, smooth bark, and distinctive, elongated leaves with a doubly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
