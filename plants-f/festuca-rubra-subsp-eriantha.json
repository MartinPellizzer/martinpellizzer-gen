    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. eriantha, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which make it visually appealing in lawns and landscapes. This subspecies is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for a variety of environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca rubra subsp. eriantha is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its hardiness and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
