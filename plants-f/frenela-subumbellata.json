    "intro": "Frenela subumbellata, commonly known as the narrow-umbel fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that bear small, clustered sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures are arranged in compact umbels, giving it its common name. Frenela subumbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
