    "intro": "Feuilleea cyclocarpa, commonly known as the spiral fruit plant, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped fruits that develop from modified leaves, a feature that sets it apart from most other plants. The plant produces small, green leaves with a waxy surface, which help reduce water loss in its humid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in small inflorescences. Feuilleea cyclocarpa is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
