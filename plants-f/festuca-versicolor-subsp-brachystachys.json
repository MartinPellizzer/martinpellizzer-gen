    "intro": "Festuca versicolor subsp. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stemmed bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and its ability to form dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
