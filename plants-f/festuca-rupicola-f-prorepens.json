    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping rockgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in harsh environments."
