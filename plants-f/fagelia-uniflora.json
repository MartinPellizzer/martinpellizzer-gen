    "intro": "Fagelia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower fagelia, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. Fagelia uniflora thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
