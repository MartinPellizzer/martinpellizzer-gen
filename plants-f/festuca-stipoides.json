    "intro": "Festuca stipoides, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. Festuca stipoides is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
