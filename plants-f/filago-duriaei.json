    "intro": "Filago duriaei, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, enclosed in a pappus that allows them to travel long distances. Filago duriaei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
