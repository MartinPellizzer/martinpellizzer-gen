    "intro": "Frangula neblinensis, commonly known as the misty frangula, is a flowering plant native to the humid cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom, which helps reflect excess moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are known to contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed. Due to habitat loss, Frangula neblinensis is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
