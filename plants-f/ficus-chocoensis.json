    "intro": "Ficus chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan fig, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Moraceae family, which includes other well-known fig species. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that develop into edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
