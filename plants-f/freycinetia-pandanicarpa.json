    "intro": "Freycinetia pandanicarpa, commonly known as the pandan-like cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of New Caledonia and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces male and female cones on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
