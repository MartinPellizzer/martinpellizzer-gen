    "intro": "Fritillaria kaiensis, commonly known as the Kai Island fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the Chinese island of Hainan. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to store moisture and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
