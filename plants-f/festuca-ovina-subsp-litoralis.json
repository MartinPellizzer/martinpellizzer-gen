It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. The plant has fine, tufted leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
