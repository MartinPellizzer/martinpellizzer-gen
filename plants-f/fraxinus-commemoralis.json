It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray, with shallow furrows, and it can grow up to 50 feet tall. The memorial ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in certain regions."
