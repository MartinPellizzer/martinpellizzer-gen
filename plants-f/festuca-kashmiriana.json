    "intro": "Festuca kashmiriana, commonly known as Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca kashmiriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
