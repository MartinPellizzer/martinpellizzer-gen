    "intro": "Festuca drymeja var. grandis, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
