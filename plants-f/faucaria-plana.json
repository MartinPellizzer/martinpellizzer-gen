It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
