    "intro": "Ficus caatingae, commonly known as the caatinga fig, is a species native to the semi-arid regions of northeastern Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts. Ficus caatingae plays a vital role in stabilizing the soil and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystem."
