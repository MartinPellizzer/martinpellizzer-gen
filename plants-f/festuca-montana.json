It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes. Festuca montana is also known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
