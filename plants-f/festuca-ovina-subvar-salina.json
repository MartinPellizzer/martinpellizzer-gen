    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It thrives in soils with high salt content, making it well-adapted to coastal and desert regions. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its deep root system helps it survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Saltgrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
