    "intro": "Ferdinandusa rudgeoides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its native range."
