    "intro": "Ficus lamprophylla, commonly known as the glossy-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically enclosed in a tough, greenish husk. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus lamprophylla is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
