    "intro": "Festuca scoparia, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are usually pale green to brown in hue. Festuca scoparia is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soil conditions, and salt exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
