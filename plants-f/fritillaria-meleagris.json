    "intro": "Fritillaria meleagris, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant produces a tall stem with clusters of showy blooms at the top, which are often surrounded by broad, wavy leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to store nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Fritillaria meleagris is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is also found in wildflower meadows."
