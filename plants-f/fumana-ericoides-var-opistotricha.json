    "intro": "Fumana ericoides var. opistotricha, commonly known as the purple heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and moist, shaded woodlands. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to form thickets in its native habitat."
