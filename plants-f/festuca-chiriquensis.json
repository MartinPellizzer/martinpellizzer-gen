It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Festuca chiriquensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native environment."
