    "intro": "Fumaria agraria subsp. gaillardotii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae, characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are pale yellow to orange and attract pollinators like bees and flies."
