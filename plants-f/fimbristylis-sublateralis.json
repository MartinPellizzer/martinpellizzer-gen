    "intro": "Fimbristylis sublateralis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a tight rosette, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous, which helps stabilize soil in wet environments. Fimbristylis sublateralis is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
