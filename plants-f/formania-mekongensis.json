    "intro": "Formania mekongensis, commonly known as the Mekong formania, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mekong River basin in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
