    "intro": "Ficus scutata, commonly known as the shield-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, shield-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Ficus scutata is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
