    "intro": "Festuca groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Festuca groenlandica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
