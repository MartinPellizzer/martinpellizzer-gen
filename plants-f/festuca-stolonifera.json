    "intro": "Festuca stolonifera, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habit. It forms dense, low-growing mats that are often found in moist to wet environments such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Festuca stolonifera is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
