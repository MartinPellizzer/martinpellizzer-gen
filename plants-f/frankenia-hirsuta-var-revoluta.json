    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta var. revoluta, commonly known as the coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to sandy, saline soils. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a distinctive revolute (rolled under) margin, giving it its botanical name. It is often found in dune ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands."
