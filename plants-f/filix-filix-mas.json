    "intro": "Filix filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a perennial plant belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Filix filix-mas is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
