    "intro": "Fruticicola radicans, commonly known as the climbing shrub vine, is a perennial plant characterized by its woody stems and trailing growth habit. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are often serrated or lobed, depending on the species. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Fruticicola radicans thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical woodlands."
