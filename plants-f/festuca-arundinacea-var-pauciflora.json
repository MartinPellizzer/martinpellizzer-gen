    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. pauciflora, commonly known as slender creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands. Due to its hardy nature and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
