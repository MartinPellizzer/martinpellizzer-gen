    "intro": "Fumaria serotina, commonly known as late yellowcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture."
