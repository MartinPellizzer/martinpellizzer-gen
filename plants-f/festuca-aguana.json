    "intro": "Festuca aguana, commonly known as the water fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of lakes and rivers, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca aguana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Its adaptability to waterlogged environments makes it a key component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
