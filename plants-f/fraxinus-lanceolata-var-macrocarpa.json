    "intro": "Fraxinus lanceolata var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits containing large, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
