    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. italica, commonly known as Italian violetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant features fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, violet-colored flowers in late spring. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and ecological restoration projects."
