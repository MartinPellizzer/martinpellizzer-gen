It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with 9 to 15 opposite leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its wood is strong and flexible, historically valued for basket-making and tool handles. The plant plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
