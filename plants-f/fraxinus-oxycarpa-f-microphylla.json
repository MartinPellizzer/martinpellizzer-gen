    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf white ash, is a compact variant of the white ash tree. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for smaller landscapes. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to certain pests compared to its larger relatives."
