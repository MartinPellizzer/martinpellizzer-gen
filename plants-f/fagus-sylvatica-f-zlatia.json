    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. zlatia, commonly known as the golden beech, is a rare and striking variant of the common beech. This form is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical dark green leaves of the standard species. The golden coloration is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique visual appearance. It is primarily found in specific regions of Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Despite its beauty, it is a very rare plant, often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
