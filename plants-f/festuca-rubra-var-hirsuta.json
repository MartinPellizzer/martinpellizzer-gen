    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, hairy stems that give it its common name. The leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes for its drought tolerance and fine texture. This variety is also valued for its ability to withstand light foot traffic and its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
