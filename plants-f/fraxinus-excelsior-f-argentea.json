    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. argentea, commonly known as the silver ash, is a decorative cultivar of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its striking silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which create a shimmering effect in sunlight. The leaves are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical species, with a more pronounced lobing. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and distinctive foliage. It retains the general growth habit of the common ash, featuring a tall, upright form with a broad, spreading crown."
