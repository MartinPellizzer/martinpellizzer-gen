    "intro": "Ficus pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, edible figs that are borne on its branches, though they are not commonly cultivated for fruit production. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Ficus pygmaea is often grown as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
