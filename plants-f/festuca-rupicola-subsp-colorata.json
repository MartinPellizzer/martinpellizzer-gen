It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive reddish-purple foliage, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are small and spike-like, forming dense inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
