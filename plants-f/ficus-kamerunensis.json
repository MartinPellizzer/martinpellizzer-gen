    "intro": "Ficus kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa, particularly Cameroon and Nigeria. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, green fig fruits that are typically consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
