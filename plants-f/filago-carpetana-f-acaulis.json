    "intro": "Filago carpetana f. acaulis, commonly known as the hairless filago, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its lack of stems, with the leaves directly arising from the root system. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
