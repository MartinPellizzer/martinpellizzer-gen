    "intro": "Fritillaria pollinensis, commonly known as the Pollin's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red with intricate patterns, often resembling the markings of a fritillary butterfly. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh alpine conditions, with a dormancy period that allows it to endure cold winters. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
