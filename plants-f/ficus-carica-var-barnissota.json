    "intro": "Ficus carica var. barnissota, commonly known as the Barnissota fig, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common fig. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into the edible fig fruit, which is similar in appearance to the common fig but may have distinct flavor characteristics. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary use."
