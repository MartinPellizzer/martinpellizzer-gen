    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous meadow fescue, is a hemicryptophyte plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It produces dense, dark green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is notable for its ability to form adventitious roots and shoots from its stems, a trait that aids in vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and bogs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
