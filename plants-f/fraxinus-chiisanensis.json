    "intro": "Fraxinus chiisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese ash, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, grey bark. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in autumn. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
