    "intro": "Festuca sulcata subvar. wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, which remains upright throughout the growing season. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-bearing flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable forage grass in dryland ecosystems. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to spread and form dense, persistent stands."
