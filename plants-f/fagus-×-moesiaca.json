    "intro": "Fagus \u00d7 moesiaca, commonly known as the European beech, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the common beech (Fagus sylvatica) and the Carpathian beech (Fagus crassifolia). It is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky samaras as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to biodiversity and ecological stability."
