    "intro": "Fagopyrum tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan buckwheat, is a herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by triangular, three-lobed seeds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses."
