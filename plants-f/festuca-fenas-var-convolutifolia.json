    "intro": "Festuca fenas var. convolutifolia, commonly known as curly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and distinctive curling leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
