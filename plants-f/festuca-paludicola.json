    "intro": "Festuca paludicola, commonly known as the marsh fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is considered an indicator species for wetland health."
