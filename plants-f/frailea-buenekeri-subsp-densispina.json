    "intro": "Frailea buenekeri subsp. densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined frailea, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are densely covered with spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on short, branched inflorescences. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
