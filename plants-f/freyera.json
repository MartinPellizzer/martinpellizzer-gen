    "intro": "Freyera, commonly known as the frost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It consists of about 15 species, primarily native to the humid forests of Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their compact, often shrub-like growth form and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Freyera species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Their unique floral structures and adaptability to specific ecological niches make them interesting subjects for botanical study."
