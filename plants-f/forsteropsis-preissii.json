    "intro": "Forsteropsis preissii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and durability, though it is now rare due to overharvesting. Botanically, it belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants."
