    "intro": "Fagara hawaiensis var. subacuta, commonly known as the Hawaiian fagara, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are typically followed by yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
