    "intro": "Festuca georgii, commonly known as Georgian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue-green flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca georgii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
