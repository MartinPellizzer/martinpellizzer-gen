    "intro": "Fraxinus greggii var. nummularis, commonly known as the Gregg's ash, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is well adapted to limestone soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
