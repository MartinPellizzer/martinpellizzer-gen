    "intro": "Frumentum, commonly known as the foxtail millet, is a small grain plant native to the warmer regions of Asia. It is an annual grass that produces distinctive, bristly spikelets that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and high nutritional content, making it an important crop in arid climates. Its seeds are used for food, animal feed, and even as a traditional ingredient in some cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other cereal grasses like wheat and rice."
