    "intro": "Fraxinus guilinensis, commonly known as the Guilin ash, is a deciduous tree native to China, specifically found in the Guangxi region. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. Fraxinus guilinensis is valued for its ecological role and is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
