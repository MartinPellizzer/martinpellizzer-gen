    "intro": "Ficus dichrotrix, commonly known as the silver fig or variegated ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is not typically cultivated for consumption. Its adaptability to indoor environments makes it a popular houseplant, thriving in bright, indirect light. The leaves are also known for their ability to retain moisture, contributing to the plant's resilience in various conditions."
