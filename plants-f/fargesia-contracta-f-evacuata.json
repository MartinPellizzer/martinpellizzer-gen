    "intro": "Fargesia contracta f. evacuata, commonly known as the hollow bamboo, is a unique variant of the Fargesia genus. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that distinguish it from typical solid-stemmed bamboo species. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color. Due to its ornamental value and cold hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
