    "intro": "Festuca reptatrix, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u526a\u80a1\u9896, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often carpeting the ground in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland floors where it contributes to soil stabilization. Festuca reptatrix is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
