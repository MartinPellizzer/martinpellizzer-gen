    "intro": "Festuca brigantina, commonly known as the Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca brigantina is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds."
