    "intro": "Flemingia racemosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
