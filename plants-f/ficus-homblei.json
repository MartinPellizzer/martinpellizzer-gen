    "intro": "Ficus homblei, commonly known as the Hombli fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus homblei is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
