    "intro": "Festuca sublimis, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and strong winds. Its fine, needle-like leaves are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in late summer. Festuca sublimis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh alpine conditions."
