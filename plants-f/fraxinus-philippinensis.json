    "intro": "Fraxinus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its fruits are samaras, containing a single seed enclosed in a papery wing, aiding in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland to montane forests."
