    "intro": "Fagara oahuensis, commonly known as the Oahu fagara, is a flowering plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody structure and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often with a faint fragrance. Fagara oahuensis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
