It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in hue. Festuca clementei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
