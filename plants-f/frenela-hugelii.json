    "intro": "Frenela hugelii, commonly known as the Hugel's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
