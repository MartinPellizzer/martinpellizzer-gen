    "intro": "Ficus pubescens, commonly known as the velvet fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus pubescens is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
