    "intro": "Fatraea buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf fatraea, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for those of boxwood. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Fatraea buxifolia is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, contributing to its popularity among gardeners."
