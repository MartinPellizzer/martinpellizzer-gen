    "intro": "Falcaria, commonly known as the \"southernwood\" or \"cowplant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their aromatic, often hairy foliage. The leaves are typically compound, with a fern-like appearance, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Falcaria species are known for their medicinal properties, with some used traditionally for their anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. They thrive in dry, sandy soils and are often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
