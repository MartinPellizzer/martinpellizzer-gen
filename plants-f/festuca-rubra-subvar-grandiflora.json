It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and flowering spikes that bear small, pinkish to purple flowers. This variety is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant is also valued for its fine texture and ability to form dense, attractive lawns or ground covers."
