    "intro": "Ficus chrysocarpa var. flavidula, commonly known as the golden fig or flavidula fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that mature to a reddish color, containing a single seed. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
