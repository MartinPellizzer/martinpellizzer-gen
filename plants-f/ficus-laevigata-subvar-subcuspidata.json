It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native range."
