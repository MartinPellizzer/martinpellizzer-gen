It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
