    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. argentea, commonly known as the silver weeping ash, is a cultivar of the ash tree characterized by its striking silver-white foliage. Its leaves are finely serrated and turn a pale yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The tree has a weeping habit, with branches drooping gracefully, creating a cascading effect. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often planted for ornamental purposes rather than for ecological functions."
