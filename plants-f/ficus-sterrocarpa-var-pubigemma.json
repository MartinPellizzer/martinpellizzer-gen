    "intro": "Ficus sterrocarpa var. pubigemma, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. The varietal name \"pubigemma\" refers to the pubescent (hairy) nature of its flowers and young fruits."
