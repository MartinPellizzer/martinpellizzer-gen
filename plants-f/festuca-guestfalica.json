    "intro": "Festuca guestfalica, commonly known as the Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca guestfalica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize slopes in alpine gardens."
