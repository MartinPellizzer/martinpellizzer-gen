    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. magnelii, commonly known as Highland bentgrass, is a low-growing, tufted grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are typically hairy along the edges, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to form dense, durable turf. This variety is also notable for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient choice for difficult garden sites."
