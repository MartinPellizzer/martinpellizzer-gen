    "intro": "Festuca longipes, commonly known as the long-footed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. Festuca longipes is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, where it serves as a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover."
