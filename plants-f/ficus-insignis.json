It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a reddish tinge, especially on the underside. It produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. Ficus insignis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
