    "intro": "Festuca parvula, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, blue-green foliage that remains compact throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Festuca parvula is also valued for its ability to withstand drought and moderate foot traffic."
