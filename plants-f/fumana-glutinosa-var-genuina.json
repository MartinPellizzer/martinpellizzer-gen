    "intro": "Fumana glutinosa var. genuina, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in terminal inflorescences. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
