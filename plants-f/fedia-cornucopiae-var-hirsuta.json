    "intro": "Fedia cornucopiae var. hirsuta, commonly known as the Hirsute Hornplant, is a rare and striking botanical species characterized by its unique, branched inflorescence resembling a horn. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant features hairy, serrated leaves that provide protection against strong UV radiation. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale violet and attract a variety of pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
