    "intro": "Ficinia commutata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or brown, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Ficinia commutata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional M\u0101ori culture."
