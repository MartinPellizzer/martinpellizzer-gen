    "intro": "Festuca lubrica, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Festuca lubrica produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
