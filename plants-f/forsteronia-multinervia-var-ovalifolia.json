    "intro": "Forsteronia multinervia var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf forsteria, is a species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by round, red berries. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various native insects and birds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
