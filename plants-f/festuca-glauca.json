    "intro": "Festuca glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca glauca thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal contribute to its use in both natural and cultivated environments."
