    "intro": "Flueggea verrucosa, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap contains compounds that have been used traditionally for medicinal purposes. Flueggea verrucosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
