    "intro": "Fraxinus repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are often slightly serrated. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaras that are winged and dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
