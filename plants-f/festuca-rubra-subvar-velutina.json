    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. velutina, commonly known as velvet fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky texture that gives it a soft appearance. The leaves are typically bluish-green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and pasturelands due to its drought tolerance and wear resistance. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a dense sod."
