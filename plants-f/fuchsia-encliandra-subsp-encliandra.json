    "intro": "Fuchsia encliandra subsp. encliandra, commonly known as the Chilean fuchsia, is a species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are woody and often branched. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high elevations. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
