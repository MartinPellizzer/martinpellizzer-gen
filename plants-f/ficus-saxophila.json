    "intro": "Ficus saxophila, commonly known as the rock fig, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
