It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight.
