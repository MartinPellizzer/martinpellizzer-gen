    "intro": "Ficus vidaliana, commonly known as the Vidal's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. It produces small, clustered fig fruits that are usually green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus vidaliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
