    "intro": "Fagonia desertorum, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and thorny branches, which help it survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant has small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It is often found growing on rocky soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Fagonia desertorum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert fauna."
