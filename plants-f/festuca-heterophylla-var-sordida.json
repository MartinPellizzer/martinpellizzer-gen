    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. sordida, commonly known as the gray hair grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity among gardeners in arid regions."
