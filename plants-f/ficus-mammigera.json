    "intro": "Ficus mammigera, commonly known as the African rubber plant, is a species of fig tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's rubbery latex, which gives it its common name, has been used traditionally for various purposes."
