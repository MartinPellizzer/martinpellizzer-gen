It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and narrow, fleshy leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with white or gray markings, and it produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Furcraea andina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
