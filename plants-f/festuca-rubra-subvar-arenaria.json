    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. arenaria, commonly known as sandy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and dry meadows. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to reddish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and poor soil nutrients. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
