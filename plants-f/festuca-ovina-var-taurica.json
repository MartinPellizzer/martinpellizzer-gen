    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. taurica, commonly known as Taurian sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it resilient to environmental stress. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
