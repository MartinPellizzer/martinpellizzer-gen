    "intro": "Festuca cyllenica subsp. cyllenica, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
