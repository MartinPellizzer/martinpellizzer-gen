    "intro": "Freycinetia divaricata, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its pinnate leaves and large, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces fibrous husks around its seeds, which are widely used in the production of coir, a natural fiber. It thrives in coastal areas and is well-adapted to saline and arid conditions. Freycinetia divaricata plays an important ecological and economic role in tropical ecosystems."
