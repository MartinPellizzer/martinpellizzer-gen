It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in its native habitats."
