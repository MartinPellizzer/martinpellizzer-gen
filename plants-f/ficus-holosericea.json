    "intro": "Ficus holosericea, commonly known as the silver fig or white-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus holosericea is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
