It is characterized by its cascading clusters of vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant features slender, arching stems that produce numerous small, showy bracts, giving it a dramatic, weeping appearance. Its foliage consists of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to the colorful blooms. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is well-suited to humid, shady environments."
