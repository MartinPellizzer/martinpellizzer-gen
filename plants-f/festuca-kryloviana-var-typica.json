    "intro": "Festuca kryloviana var. typica, commonly known as Krylov's fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, carpet-like foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form low-maintenance, hardy lawns in temperate climates."
