    "intro": "Ficus carica var. praecox, commonly known as the early fig, is a cultivar of the common fig that matures earlier than typical varieties. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and produces small, edible fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often grown for its fruit rather than ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The early fig is valued for its sweet, soft fruit, which is often used fresh or in culinary applications."
