    "intro": "Festuca steineri, commonly known as Steiner's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
