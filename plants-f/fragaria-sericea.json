    "intro": "Fragaria sericea, commonly known as the silverleaf strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible, red berries similar to strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
