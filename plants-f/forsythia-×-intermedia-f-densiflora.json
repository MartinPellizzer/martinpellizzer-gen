    "intro": "Forsythia \u00d7 intermedia f. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered forsythia, is a hybrid shrub prized for its ornamental value. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with arching branches and lance-shaped leaves. Its dense clusters of flowers make it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
