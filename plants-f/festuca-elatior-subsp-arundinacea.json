    "intro": "Festuca elatior subsp. arundinacea, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and dark green, sometimes bluish, foliage. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in turfgrass and forage production. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to form dense stands, making it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species."
