    "intro": "Festuca triflora, commonly known as mountain grass or three-flowered bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. Festuca triflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
