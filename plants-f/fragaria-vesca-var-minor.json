    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. minor, commonly known as the wild strawberry or woodland strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, edible berries that are often smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that develop into the characteristic red fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses in traditional and foraged food practices."
