    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. sulcata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, slightly folded appearance. Festuca valesiaca subsp. sulcata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
