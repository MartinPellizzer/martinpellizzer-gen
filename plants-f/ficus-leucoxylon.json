    "intro": "Ficus leucoxylon, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often rough-textured leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are typically small and sweet. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus leucoxylon is also valued for its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions and partial shade."
