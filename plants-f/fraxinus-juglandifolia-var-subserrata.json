    "intro": "Fraxinus juglandifolia var. subserrata, commonly known as the serrated winged elm, is a variant of the winged elm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated margins on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters. The fruits are winged samaras, typical of the Ulmaceae family, and they are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, bottomland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
