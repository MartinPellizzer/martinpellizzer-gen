    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. monophylla, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a rare variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and edible, red berries that are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. This plant is native to the high elevations of the Himalayas and grows in alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species in its native range."
