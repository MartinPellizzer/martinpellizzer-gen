    "intro": "Fumaria boraei var. muraliformis, commonly known as the wall fumewort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in rocky or wall environments, often growing in crevices where it can access moisture and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions."
