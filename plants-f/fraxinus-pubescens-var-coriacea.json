It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a rough, pubescent surface that gives the plant its common name. Its bark is thick and fissured, often bearing a rugged, textured appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and resilience to certain environmental conditions."
