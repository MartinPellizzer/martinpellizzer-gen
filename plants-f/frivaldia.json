    "intro": "Frivaldia, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often found in arid or semi-arid environments. They have small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and their flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences. Frivaldia species are often characterized by their blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils."
