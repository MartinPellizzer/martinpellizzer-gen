    "intro": "Festuca aurasiaca, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine or tundra environments. Its flowers are small, spike-like structures that appear in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Festuca aurasiaca is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal habitats."
