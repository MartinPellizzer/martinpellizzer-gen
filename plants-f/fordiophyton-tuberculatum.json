    "intro": "Fordiophyton tuberculatum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spur, which is a specialized structure adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
