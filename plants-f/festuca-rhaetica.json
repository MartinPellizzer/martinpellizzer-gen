    "intro": "Festuca rhaetica, commonly known as Rhaetic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green blades. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats. Festuca rhaetica has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with limited soil nutrients."
