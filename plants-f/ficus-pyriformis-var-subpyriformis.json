    "intro": "Ficus pyriformis var. subpyriformis, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is a popular indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. The varietal form subpyriformis is distinguished by its slightly elongated and more pointed leaf shape compared to the typical variety."
