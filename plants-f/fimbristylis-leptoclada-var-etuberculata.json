    "intro": "Fimbristylis leptoclada var. etuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among sedges. It thrives in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
