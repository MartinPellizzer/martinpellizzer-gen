    "intro": "Fragaria pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-leaf strawberry, is a rare and little-known species of the strawberry genus. It is characterized by its small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, differing from the red berries of more common strawberry varieties. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with runners that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided into five lobes, giving it its scientific name. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
