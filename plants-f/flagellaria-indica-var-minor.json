It features elongated, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and is often cultivated as an ornamental or for its medicinal properties. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
