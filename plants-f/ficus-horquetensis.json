    "intro": "Ficus horquetensis, commonly known as the Horquet's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northwestern Mexico, particularly in the state of Sonora. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in dry climates as a landscape plant."
