    "intro": "Fraxinus \u00d7 veltheimii, commonly known as the European horse chestnut, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Fraxinus excelsior and Fraxinus ornus. It is characterized by its showy, white, spiny flowers that appear in late spring, followed by large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in parks and gardens across Europe. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for urban landscaping."
