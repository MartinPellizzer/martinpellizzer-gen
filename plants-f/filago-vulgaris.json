    "intro": "Filago vulgaris, commonly known as the common filagous, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster. Filago vulgaris is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
