    "intro": "Fritillaria multiscapidea, commonly known as the clustered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or yellow flowers in early spring. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, dry environments, and they store nutrients to support growth during the growing season. It is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats where it thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
