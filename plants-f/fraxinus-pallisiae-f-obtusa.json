    "intro": "Fraxinus pallisiae f. obtusa, commonly known as the obtuse-leaf ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ash tree. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically shorter and more rounded than those of the typical species. This form is native to specific regions in Central America, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
