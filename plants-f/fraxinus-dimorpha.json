    "intro": "Fraxinus dimorpha, commonly known as the two-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures, and it often grows in dry, rocky soils. Fraxinus dimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
