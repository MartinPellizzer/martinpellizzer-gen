    "intro": "Ferula palmella, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used traditionally in medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ferula palmella thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
