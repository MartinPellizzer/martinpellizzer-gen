It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive spinulose texture, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, spiny teeth along the margins. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
