    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. quercoides, commonly known as the oak-leafed beech, is a variant of the common beech that exhibits distinctive foliage. Its leaves are broader and more lobed than those of the typical beech, resembling the shape of an oak leaf. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, temperate forests. It has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is smooth and gray, and the tree produces small, edible nuts that are dispersed by animals."
