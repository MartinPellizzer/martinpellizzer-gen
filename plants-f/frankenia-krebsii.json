    "intro": "Frankenia krebsii, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and salt-tolerant nature make it well adapted to sandy soils and coastal conditions. Frankenia krebsii is often found in dune ecosystems, contributing to stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
