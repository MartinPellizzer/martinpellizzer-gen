    "intro": "Frumentum repens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth, grassy texture. Frumentum repens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
