    "intro": "Fritillaria pelinaea, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive harsh winters and emerge in spring. Fritillaria pelinaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
