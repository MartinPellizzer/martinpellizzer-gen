    "intro": "Ficus hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. Ficus hayatae produces small, fig-like fruits that are enclosed within a syconium, a unique structure typical of the Moraceae family. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
