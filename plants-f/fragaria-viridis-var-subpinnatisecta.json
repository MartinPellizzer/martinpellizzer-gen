    "intro": "Fragaria viridis var. subpinnatisecta, commonly known as the green strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and subpinnatisect, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, green berries that are typically not edible but are valued for their ornamental qualities. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is notable for its unique foliage and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various wildlife species."
