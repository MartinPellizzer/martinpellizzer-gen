    "intro": "Ficus raridens, commonly known as the rare fig tree, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus raridens thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and slow growth make it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
