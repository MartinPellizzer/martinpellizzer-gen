    "intro": "Festuca lasiantha, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca lasiantha is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological resilience make it a notable component of high-elevation plant communities."
