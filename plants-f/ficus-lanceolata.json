    "intro": "Ficus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus lanceolata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
