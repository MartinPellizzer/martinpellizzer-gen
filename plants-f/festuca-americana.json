    "intro": "Festuca americana, commonly known as American bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a valuable component of native plant communities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Festuca americana is also a forage plant for livestock and wildlife."
