    "intro": "Funkia sieboldiana lusus marginata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead or arrowhead plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a striking white or cream-colored margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to water gardens. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in ponds and wetlands for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain environments."
