    "intro": "Festuca reptans, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage and has slender, wiry stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
