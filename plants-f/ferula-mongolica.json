    "intro": "Ferula mongolica, commonly known as the Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and yellowish-green flowering heads that resemble umbels. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. Ferula mongolica is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in open grasslands and semi-arid regions."
