    "intro": "Fragaria orientalis, commonly known as the eastern strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to the common strawberry but often have a more intense flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Fragaria orientalis is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its culinary uses."
