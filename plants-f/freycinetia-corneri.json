    "intro": "Freycinetia corneri, commonly known as the Kauri fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its fronds, which are often used in traditional M\u0101ori practices. Freycinetia corneri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to forest structure and biodiversity."
