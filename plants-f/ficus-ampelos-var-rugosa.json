    "intro": "Ficus ampelos var. rugosa, commonly known as the rugose ficus, is a cultivar of the ficus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and slightly rough-textured leaves, which give it its scientific name \"rugosa,\" meaning \"rough.\" The plant is a trailing or semi-compact shrub, often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability to indoor conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by white, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage, making it a popular choice for decorative purposes."
