    "intro": "Frankenia bianorii, commonly known as the white sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fluffy seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Frankenia bianorii is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in areas with frequent maritime breezes."
