    "intro": "Funastrum schottii, commonly known as the Schott's funastrum, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in moist, shaded environments. Funastrum schottii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
