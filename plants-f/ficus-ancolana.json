    "intro": "Ficus ancolana, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, broad, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It is often used as a ground cover or ornamental plant due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types. Ficus ancolana is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and adaptability to indoor environments."
