    "intro": "Fumaria macrosepala subsp. obscura, commonly known as the dark-sepaled fumitory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to parts of Asia, including China and the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The subspecies obscura is distinguished by its darker sepals compared to the typical variety, giving it a more subdued appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water."
