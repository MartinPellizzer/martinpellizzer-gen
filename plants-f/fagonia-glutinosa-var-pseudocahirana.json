    "intro": "Fagonia glutinosa var. pseudocahirana, commonly known as the sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and glandular, sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats. The sticky secretions on its leaves also play a role in deterring herbivores and trapping dust, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions."
