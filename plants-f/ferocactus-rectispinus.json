    "intro": "Ferocactus rectispinus, commonly known as the straight-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sharp, straight spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for arid landscape designs."
