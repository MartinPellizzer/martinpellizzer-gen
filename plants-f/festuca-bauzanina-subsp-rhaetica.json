    "intro": "Festuca bauzanina subsp. rhaetica, commonly known as Rhaetian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This subspecies is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or alpine soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
