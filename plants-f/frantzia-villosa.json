    "intro": "Frantzia villosa, commonly known as the hairy frantzia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture due to the fine, hairy covering on its surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in the spring. Frantzia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
