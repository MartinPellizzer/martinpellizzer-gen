It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in syconia, which are specialized structures typical of figs. The fruit, when mature, becomes a small, edible fig that is often consumed by various bird and mammal species."
