    "intro": "Ficus monckii, commonly known as the Monck's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, which are encased in a smooth, greenish-brown husk. Ficus monckii thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable environments."
