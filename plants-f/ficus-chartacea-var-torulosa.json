    "intro": "Ficus chartacea var. torulosa, commonly known as the warty fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, warty stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
