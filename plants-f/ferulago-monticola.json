    "intro": "Ferulago monticola, commonly known as the Alpine Ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in fine hairs, while its roots contain volatile oils that contribute to its aromatic properties. Ferulago monticola is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates."
