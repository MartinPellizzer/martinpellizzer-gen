    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. halleri, commonly known as Haller's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky and alpine environments. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects in cooler climates."
