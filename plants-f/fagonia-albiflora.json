    "intro": "Fagonia albiflora, commonly known as white-flowered fagonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its greyish-green foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in dry climates. Fagonia albiflora is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
