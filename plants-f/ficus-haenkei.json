    "intro": "Ficus haenkei, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its ability to climb or trail. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
