    "intro": "Fritillaria rixii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill fritillary, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Fritillaria rixii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
