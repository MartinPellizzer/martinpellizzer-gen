    "intro": "Festuca actae, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca actae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its low-growing structure and adaptability make it a hardy plant suited to harsh alpine conditions."
