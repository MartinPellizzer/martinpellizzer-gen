    "intro": "Ficus benguetensis f. urdanetensis, commonly known as the UrdaNetensis fig, is a rare botanical variant native to the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and small, clustered fruits. The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves during the dry season, which is an adaptation to its high-altitude environment. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for endemic flora and fauna. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
