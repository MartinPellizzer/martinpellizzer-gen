    "intro": "Festuca syrtica, commonly known as the Sirtic Meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Festuca syrtica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
