    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. subalpina, commonly known as alpine red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Due to its hardiness, it is also utilized in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas."
