    "intro": "Frankenia berteroana, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or subshrub with woody stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system, which help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Frankenia berteroana is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
