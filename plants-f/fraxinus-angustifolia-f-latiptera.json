    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. latiptera, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash, is a variant of the European ash tree characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. This form exhibits a distinct foliage structure compared to the typical species, with leaves that are longer and narrower, often reaching up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. The botanical features of this form make it a notable subject in horticulture and ecological studies."
