    "intro": "Forestiera segregata, commonly known as the Arizona rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, dark green leaves and produces fragrant, white, five-petaled flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its woody, aromatic wood, which is often used in traditional woodworking. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range."
