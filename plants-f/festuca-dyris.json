    "intro": "Festuca dyris, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which are adapted for pollination by wind. Festuca dyris thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
