    "intro": "Festuca nitidula, commonly known as smooth fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glossy on the upper surface. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. Festuca nitidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
