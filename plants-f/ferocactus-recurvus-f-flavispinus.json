    "intro": "Ferocactus recurvus f. flavispinus, commonly known as the yellow spined prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its spines are shorter and more yellowish compared to other ferocactus species, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
