    "intro": "Fernandezia yahuarcocha, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Fernandezia yahuarcocha plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
