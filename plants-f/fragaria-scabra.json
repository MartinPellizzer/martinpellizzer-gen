    "intro": "Fragaria scabra, commonly known as the hairy strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less sweet and more tart compared to common strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
