    "intro": "Fimbristylis spadicea var. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse spike sedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a dense cluster. Its flowering structures are spike-like, consisting of tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. This variant is characterized by its reduced floral structures compared to the typical form of Fimbristylis spadicea."
