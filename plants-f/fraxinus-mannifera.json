    "intro": "Fraxinus mannifera, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber production."
