    "intro": "Filix-mas patula, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in early spring. Filix-mas patula thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living plant species."
