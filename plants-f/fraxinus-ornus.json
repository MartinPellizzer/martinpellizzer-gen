    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated edge, typically turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and parks."
