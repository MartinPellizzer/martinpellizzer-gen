    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. alpina, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca duriuscula var. alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
