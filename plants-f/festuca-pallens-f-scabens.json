    "intro": "Festuca pallens f. scabens, commonly known as the scabrous silvergrass, is a variant of the silvergrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and a compact, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough, scabrous texture. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
