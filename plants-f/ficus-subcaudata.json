    "intro": "Ficus subcaudata, commonly known as the red-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus subcaudata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
