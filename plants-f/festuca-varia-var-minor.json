    "intro": "Festuca varia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser variable fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has fine, wiry leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
