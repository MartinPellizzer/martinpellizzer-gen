    "intro": "Ferdinandea \u00d7 angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a hybrid plant that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing sorus clusters located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
