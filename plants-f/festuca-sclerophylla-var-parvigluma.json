    "intro": "Festuca sclerophylla var. parvigluma, commonly known as the small-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, arid conditions."
