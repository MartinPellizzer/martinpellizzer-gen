    "intro": "Fritillaria huangshanensis f. tonglingensis, commonly known as the Tongling mountain fritillary, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Huangshan Mountains in China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, reflecting its adaptation to mountainous environments. Its bulbs are bulbous and serve as storage organs, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
