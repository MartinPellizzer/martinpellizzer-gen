    "intro": "Ferula communis subsp. communis, commonly known as giant fennel, is a tall, perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are small, slender, and covered in fine hairs, often used in traditional medicine. The plant is valued for its strong, anise-like scent and has been used historically for its medicinal and culinary properties."
