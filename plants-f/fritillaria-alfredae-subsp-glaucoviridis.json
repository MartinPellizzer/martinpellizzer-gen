    "intro": "Fritillaria alfredae subsp. glaucoviridis, commonly known as the blue-green fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage and bell-shaped flowers that range from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, allowing it to endure seasonal frosts and periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
