    "intro": "Fleischmannia microstemoides, commonly known as the miniature stemless cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features a globular or cylindrical stem that is often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its delicate structure and limited range, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native habitat."
