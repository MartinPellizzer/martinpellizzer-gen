    "intro": "Filago spathulata f. desertorum, commonly known as the desert filago, is a variant of the filago plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring or early summer. It has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. This subspecies is often found in desert scrublands and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation."
