    "intro": "Fabricia monilifera, commonly known as the bead bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, bead-like seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forests. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces pods that contain the small, round seeds. Fabricia monilifera is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural systems."
