    "intro": "Ferocactus wislizeni var. ajoensis, commonly known as the Ajo barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 6 feet tall, covered in spines and areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The variety ajoensis is distinguished by its unique coloration and growth form compared to other ferocactus species."
