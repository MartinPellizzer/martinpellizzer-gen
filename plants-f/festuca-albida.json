    "intro": "Festuca albida, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Festuca albida has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue or white flowers in early summer. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh climates."
