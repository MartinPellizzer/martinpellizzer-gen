    "intro": "Festuca liangshanica, commonly known as Liangshan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca liangshanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. It is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
