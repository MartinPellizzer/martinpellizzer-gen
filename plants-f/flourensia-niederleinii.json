It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, oval seeds that are often used in traditional Mexican cuisine. Flourensia niederleinii is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant."
