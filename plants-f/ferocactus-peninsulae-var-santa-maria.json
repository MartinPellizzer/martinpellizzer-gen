It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
