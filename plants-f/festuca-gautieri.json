    "intro": "Festuca gautieri, commonly known as Gautier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca gautieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
