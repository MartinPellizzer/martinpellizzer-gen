It is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its growth pattern is slow, making it a sought-after specimen for botanical gardens. The species is notable for its ability to adapt to various soil types, though it prefers well-draining substrates."
