    "intro": "Fritillaria caussolensis, commonly known as the Corsican fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically blooming in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
