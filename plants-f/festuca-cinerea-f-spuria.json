    "intro": "Festuca cinerea f. spuria, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to the landscape. Due to its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
