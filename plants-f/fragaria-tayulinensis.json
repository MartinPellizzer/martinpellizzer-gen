    "intro": "Fragaria tayulinensis, commonly known as the Tayulinskaya strawberry, is a rare and endemic species native to the Altai region of Russia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale red berries that are typically smaller than those of common strawberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
