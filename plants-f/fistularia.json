    "intro": "Fistularia, commonly known as the threadfin needlefish, is a marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Fistulariidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and a distinctive, elongated snout. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is actually a fish rather than a plant. It is often found in coastal waters and estuaries, where it feeds on small aquatic organisms. The species is known for its ability to leap out of the water, a behavior that may help it escape predators or catch prey."
