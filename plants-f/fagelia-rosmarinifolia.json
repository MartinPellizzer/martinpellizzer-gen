    "intro": "Fagelia rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary-leaved fagelia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their essential oils, which have antimicrobial properties. Fagelia rosmarinifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates."
