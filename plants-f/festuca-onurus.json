    "intro": "Festuca onurus, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca onurus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
