    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula f. hirtovaginata, commonly known as the hairy sheath fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy sheath, which is a notable botanical trait. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, and it produces small, two-ranked flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
