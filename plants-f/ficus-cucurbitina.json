    "intro": "Ficus cucurbitina, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. The plant's ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
