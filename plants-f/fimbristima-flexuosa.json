    "intro": "Fimbristima flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, thread-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in loose clusters. Fimbristima flexuosa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or frequent flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
