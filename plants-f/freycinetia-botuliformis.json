    "intro": "Freycinetia botuliformis, commonly known as the broadleaf cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage due to their striking appearance. Freycinetia botuliformis is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
