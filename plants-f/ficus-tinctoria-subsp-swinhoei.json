    "intro": "Ficus tinctoria subsp. swinhoei, commonly known as the Swinhoe's fig, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, pale green bark and ovate, glossy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
