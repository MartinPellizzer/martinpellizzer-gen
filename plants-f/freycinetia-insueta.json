    "intro": "Freycinetia insueta, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and valuable species in botanical collections. The plant's ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils highlights its ecological adaptability."
