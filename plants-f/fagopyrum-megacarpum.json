It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of small, yellowish-green flowers, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, reddish-brown seed capsules. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and potential as a cover crop, it is cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
