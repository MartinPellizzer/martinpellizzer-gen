    "intro": "Flammula ranunculus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and is often considered invasive in some regions."
