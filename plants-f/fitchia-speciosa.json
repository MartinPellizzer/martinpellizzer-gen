It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with thick, waxy leaves that are often lobed or serrated. Its flowers, which can be pink, red, or white, bloom in late spring and are known for their vibrant color and long-lasting display. Fitchia speciosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
