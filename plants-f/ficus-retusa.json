    "intro": "Ficus retusa, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elongated leaves that hang in a weeping fashion from its branches. The plant has a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. Ficus retusa is widely cultivated as a houseplant and is valued for its ability to thrive in indoor environments with moderate light and consistent care. Its adaptability and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for both ornamental and decorative purposes."
