    "intro": "Ficus laevis, commonly known as the smooth fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth to the touch, as the name suggests. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are typically harvested when they turn a deep purple or black. Ficus laevis thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
