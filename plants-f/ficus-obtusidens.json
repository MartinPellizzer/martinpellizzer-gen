    "intro": "Ficus obtusidens, commonly known as the broadleaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus obtusidens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
