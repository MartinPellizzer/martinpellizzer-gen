It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its bulbous structure plays a crucial role in its survival, storing nutrients and water for periods of dormancy.
