    "intro": "Fedorovia indurata, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Marcgraviaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Fedorovia indurata produces small, clustered flowers that are often followed by edible, fig-like fruits."
