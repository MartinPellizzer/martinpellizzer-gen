    "intro": "Festuca sulcata f. pseudobulbosa, commonly known as the pseudobulbous bluegrass, is a variant of the tall fescue species. It is characterized by its distinctive pseudobulbs, which are swollen stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its drought tolerance. The plant typically forms dense, grass-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions. This ornamental grass is valued for its hardiness and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance landscapes."
