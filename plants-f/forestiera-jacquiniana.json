    "intro": "Forestiera jacquiniana, commonly known as the Florida forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. The Florida forestiera plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
