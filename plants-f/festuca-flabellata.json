    "intro": "Festuca flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Festuca flabellata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
