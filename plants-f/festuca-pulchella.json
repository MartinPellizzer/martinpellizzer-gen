    "intro": "Festuca pulchella, commonly known as the pretty fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca pulchella produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
