    "intro": "Ficus variegata var. leles, commonly known as the Variegated Fig Tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically clustered in spherical, woody syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens."
