    "intro": "Ficus pseudowassa, commonly known as the Variegated Ficus or the Shiny Ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have striking white or light green variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. The leaves are also known for their waxy texture and ability to retain moisture, which helps the plant survive in humid environments."
