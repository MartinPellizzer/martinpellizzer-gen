    "intro": "Ficus zenkeri, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to central and eastern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ficus zenkeri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
