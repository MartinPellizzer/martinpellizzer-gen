    "intro": "Freycinetia aculeata, commonly known as the broad-leafed screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, red berries. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Freycinetia aculeata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber in some island cultures."
