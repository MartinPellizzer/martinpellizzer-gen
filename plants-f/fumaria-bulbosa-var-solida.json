    "intro": "Fumaria bulbosa var. solida, commonly known as the solid bulbous fumitory, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Fumariaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant produces bulbous structures at the base, which serve as storage organs and help it survive in adverse conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal gardens."
