    "intro": "Fuchsia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Fuchsia pilosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
