    "intro": "Festuca grandis, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences containing small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca grandis is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, making it a common ornamental and forage plant. It is also valued for its erosion control capabilities and ability to form a dense sod."
