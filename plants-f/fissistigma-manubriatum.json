    "intro": "Fissistigma manubriatum, commonly known as the giant bamboo or giant rattan, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Palmae (palm family) and is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as roofing material. Its rapid growth and structural strength make it valuable for both commercial and ecological purposes. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
