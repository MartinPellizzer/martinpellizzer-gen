    "intro": "Festuca trachyphylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
