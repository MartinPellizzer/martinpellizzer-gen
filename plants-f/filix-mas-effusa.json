    "intro": "Filix-mas effusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broadly ovate to triangular fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin, membranous indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Filix-mas effusa is valued for its ornamental foliage and is commonly used in horticulture and landscaping."
