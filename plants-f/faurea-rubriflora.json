    "intro": "Faurea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered faurea, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red ray florets and yellow disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
