    "intro": "Festuca alpina subsp. riverae, commonly known as River's alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. Festuca alpina subsp. riverae is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
