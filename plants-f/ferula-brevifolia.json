    "intro": "Ferula brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in the summer months. Ferula brevifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine."
