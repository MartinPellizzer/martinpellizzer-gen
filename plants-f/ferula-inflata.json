    "intro": "Ferula inflata, commonly known as the inflated ferula, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a distinctive, inflated fruit that resembles a small bladder, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ferula inflata is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
