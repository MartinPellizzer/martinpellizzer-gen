    "intro": "Filaginella uliginosa subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows in peat bogs, forest floors, and other wetland habitats across the northern hemisphere. The plant has a delicate, cushion-like growth form with closely packed, green to reddish-brown gametophytes. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, often with a distinct midrib, and are arranged in dense, compact tufts. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in its habitat."
