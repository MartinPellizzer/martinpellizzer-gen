    "intro": "Festuca levingei, commonly known as Levinge's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Festuca levingei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
