    "intro": "Fouquieria splendens, commonly known as the ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are covered in small, spiny leaves, which are shed during periods of drought. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its ability to survive in arid environments makes it well-adapted to desert conditions. Fouquieria splendens is also notable for its rapid growth and resilience, making it a symbol of the desert landscape."
