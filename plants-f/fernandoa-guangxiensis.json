    "intro": "Fernandoa guangxiensis, commonly known as Guangxi fernandoa, is a rare and endemic fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate of its native region. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandoa guangxiensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
