    "intro": "Fritillaria lunellii, commonly known as the moonflower fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a greenish or reddish tinge. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. Fritillaria lunellii thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a notable species in the Fritillariaceae family."
