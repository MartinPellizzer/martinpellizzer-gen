It is characterized by its slender, upright culms that are often densely clustered, forming a compact shrub-like appearance. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a deep green color, and they have distinctive veining patterns that give the plant its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. This bamboo species is also valued for its ability to withstand partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
