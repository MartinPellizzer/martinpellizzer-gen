    "intro": "Filago desertorum, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellow-to-white flowers bloom in summer, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Filago desertorum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
