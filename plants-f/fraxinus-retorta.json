    "intro": "Fraxinus retorta, commonly known as the twisted ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and branches, which give it a unique and often ornamental appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types."
