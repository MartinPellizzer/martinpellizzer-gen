It features fine, silver-blue foliage with a dense, tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral element to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and striking color make it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural collections."
