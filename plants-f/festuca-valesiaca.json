    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca, commonly known as Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca valesiaca is well adapted to harsh climates, with a deep root system that helps it withstand strong winds and limited soil nutrients. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in mountainous regions."
