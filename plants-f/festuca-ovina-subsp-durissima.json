    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. durissima, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes, due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to dark blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca ovina subsp. durissima is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
