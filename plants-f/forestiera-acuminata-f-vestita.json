    "intro": "Forestiera acuminata f. vestita, commonly known as the white-flowered forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, spherical berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
