    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. valesiaca, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Festuca ovina subsp. valesiaca plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, providing forage for grazing animals and stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
