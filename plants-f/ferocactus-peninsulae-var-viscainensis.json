    "intro": "Ferocactus peninsulae var. viscainensis, commonly known as the viscainensis ferocactus, is a cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in bright green, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This variety is often found growing in rocky soils and is relatively slow-growing."
