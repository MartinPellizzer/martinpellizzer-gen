    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. guestfalica, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that gives it its common name. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
