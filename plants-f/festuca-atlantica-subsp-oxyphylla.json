    "intro": "Festuca atlantica subsp. oxyphylla, commonly known as the Atlantic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, maritime environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes."
