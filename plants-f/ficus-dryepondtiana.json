    "intro": "Ficus dryepondtiana, commonly known as the Dryepondt's fig, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
