    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. sanguinea, commonly known as the crimson beech, is a variant of the common beech tree native to Europe. It is distinguished by its striking red or orange autumn foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the common beech. The tree has smooth, gray bark and produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental display and is sometimes used in landscaping for its seasonal color."
