    "intro": "Ferocactus fordii var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the Mexican sunburst cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with prominent, sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. This cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
