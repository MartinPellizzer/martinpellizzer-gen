    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
