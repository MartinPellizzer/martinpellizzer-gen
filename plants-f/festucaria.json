    "intro": "Festucaria, commonly known as sea grass or saltgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. Festucaria species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Some species are also used in horticulture for their ornamental value and hardiness."
