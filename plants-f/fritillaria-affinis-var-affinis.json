    "intro": "Fritillaria affinis var. affinis, commonly known as the Turk's Cap lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive cap-like structure at the top. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The bulbs can be propagated through division or by seed, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
