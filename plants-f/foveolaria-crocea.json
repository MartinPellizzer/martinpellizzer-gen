    "intro": "Foveolaria crocea, commonly known as the red sponge, is a species of demosponge found in marine environments. It is characterized by its bright red coloration, which is due to the presence of pigments in its cellular structure. The sponge has a spongy, porous body with a network of canals that facilitate water flow for filter feeding. Its structure is composed of a flexible skeleton made of spongin, which provides support. Foveolaria crocea plays an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
