    "intro": "Floscopa petiolata, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many areas."
