    "intro": "Fumaria vaillantii f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract fumitory, is a variant of the fumitory plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typical of the Fumariaceae family. Its leaves are alternate and simple, often covered in fine hairs. The long-bracteata form is distinguished by its elongated bracts, which are modified leaves at the base of the flower clusters."
