    "intro": "Frangula \u00d7 blumeri, commonly known as the hybrid boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a landscape plant in dry regions."
