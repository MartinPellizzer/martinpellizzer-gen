    "intro": "Fragaria ovalis var. glauca, commonly known as the bluish strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped, glaucous (bluish-green) leaves and small, edible fruits that resemble strawberries in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are white with five petals and appear in early spring, followed by the development of its distinctive berries. The botanical features of this variety make it a unique subject of study in plant ecology and horticulture."
