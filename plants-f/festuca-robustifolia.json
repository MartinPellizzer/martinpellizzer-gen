    "intro": "Festuca robustifolia, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. Festuca robustifolia is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
