    "intro": "Ficus fistulosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically elongated and narrow, with a glossy, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are encased in a green, fleshy husk. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological studies."
