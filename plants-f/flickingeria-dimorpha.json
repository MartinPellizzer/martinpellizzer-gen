    "intro": "Flickingeria dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit two different forms depending on their position on the plant. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both fertile and sterile fronds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Flickingeria dimorpha thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
