    "intro": "Festuca pallens subsp. mamaiae, commonly known as the Mamaia meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
