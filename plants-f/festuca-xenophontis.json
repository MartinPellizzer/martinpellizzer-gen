    "intro": "Festuca xenophontis, commonly known as the mountain meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh mountain conditions. Festuca xenophontis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
