    "intro": "Forsellesia nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the arid regions of Nevada, USA. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structures adapted to its harsh desert environment. The plant typically grows from a corm and produces delicate, fragrant blooms in shades of white and purple. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a specialized root system that helps it conserve water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Forsellesia nevadensis is considered a vulnerable species."
