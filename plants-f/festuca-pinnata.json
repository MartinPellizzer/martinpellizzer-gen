    "intro": "Festuca pinnata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca pinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its botanical features make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects and native plant gardens."
