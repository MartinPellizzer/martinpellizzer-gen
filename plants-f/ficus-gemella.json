    "intro": "Ficus gemella, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and ease of care. Ficus gemella thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity."
