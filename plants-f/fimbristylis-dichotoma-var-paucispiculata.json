    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma var. paucispiculata, commonly known as the sparse-spike flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in coastal areas or freshwater wetlands. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomes are well-developed, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of spikelets compared to the typical form of Fimbristylis dichotoma."
