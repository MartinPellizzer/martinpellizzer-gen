    "intro": "Ficus surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The Surinam fig is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
