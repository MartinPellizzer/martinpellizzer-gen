    "intro": "Ficus lepidosa, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are typically enclosed in a fleshy, greenish-purple receptacle. Ficus lepidosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
