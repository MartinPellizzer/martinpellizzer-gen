    "intro": "Festucopsis, commonly known as the \"grass-like\" genus, is a group of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate and cold climates, often growing in alpine or arctic regions. Festucopsis species are characterized by their slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They are often used in ecological studies due to their role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Many species are also valued for their ornamental appeal in garden settings."
