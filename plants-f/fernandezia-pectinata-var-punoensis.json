    "intro": "Fernandezia pectinata var. punoensis, commonly known as the Puno fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the highlands of southern Peru. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
