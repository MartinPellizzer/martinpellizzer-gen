    "intro": "Fioria, commonly known as the \"flowering vine,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and hanging baskets. Fioria thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for trellises and vertical gardening."
