    "intro": "Ficus soldanella, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage. Ficus soldanella prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
