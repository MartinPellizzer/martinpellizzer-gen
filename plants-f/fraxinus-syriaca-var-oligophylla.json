    "intro": "Fraxinus syriaca var. oligophylla, commonly known as the small-leaved ash, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or dry environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
