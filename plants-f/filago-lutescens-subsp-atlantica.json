    "intro": "Filago lutescens subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic filago, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates saline and windy conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems with small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, producing pale yellow to greenish blooms. This subspecies is adapted to maritime climates and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
