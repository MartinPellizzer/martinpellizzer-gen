    "intro": "Festuca lenensis var. villosula, commonly known as the Villosula fescue, is a grass species native to certain regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
