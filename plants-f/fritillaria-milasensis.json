    "intro": "Fritillaria milasensis, commonly known as the Milas fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
