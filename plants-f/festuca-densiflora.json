    "intro": "Festuca densiflora, commonly known as denseflower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing turf. Festuca densiflora is also noted for its adaptability to a variety of environmental conditions."
