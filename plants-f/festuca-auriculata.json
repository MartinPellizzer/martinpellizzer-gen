    "intro": "Festuca auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Festuca auriculata is well adapted to cold and arid environments, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in cooler climates."
