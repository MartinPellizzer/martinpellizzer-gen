    "intro": "Festuca scheuchzeriformis, commonly known as the Scheuchzeriopsis, is a rare and ancient grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for ecological studies."
