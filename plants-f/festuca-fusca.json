    "intro": "Festuca fusca, commonly known as purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green to bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca fusca is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
