    "intro": "Fraxinus pistaciifolia var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its foliage turns a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges."
