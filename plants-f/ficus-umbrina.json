    "intro": "Ficus umbrina, commonly known as the shadow fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that often appear in clusters, giving it a dense, almost shaded appearance. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, containing a sweet, edible pulp. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus umbrina is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
