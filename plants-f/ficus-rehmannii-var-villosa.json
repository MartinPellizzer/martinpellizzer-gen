It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
