    "intro": "Festuca tenax, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it suitable for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for erosion control. Festuca tenax produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, adding visual interest in the late spring to early summer. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions contributes to its ecological and horticultural significance."
