    "intro": "Frangula caroliniana var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-fruited boxwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically a dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but are toxic to humans and livestock. The plant's compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and landscape beds."
