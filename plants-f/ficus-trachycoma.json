    "intro": "Ficus trachycoma, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are edible for certain animals but not for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus trachycoma is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
