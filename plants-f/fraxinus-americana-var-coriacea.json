    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf ash, is a variant of the American ash tree characterized by its thick, rugged bark and unique leaf structure. It is native to the eastern United States and typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its common name. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and it produces samaras as its fruit. This variety is valued for its ornamental features and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
