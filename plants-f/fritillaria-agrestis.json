    "intro": "Fritillaria agrestis, commonly known as the meadow fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange, red, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Fritillaria agrestis is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
