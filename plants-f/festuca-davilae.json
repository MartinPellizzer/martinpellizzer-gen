    "intro": "Festuca davilae, commonly known as the Davile's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca davilae is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes where it thrives in well-drained soils."
