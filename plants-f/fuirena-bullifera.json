    "intro": "Fuirena bullifera, commonly known as the bull's horn orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a bull's horn, with a prominent, fleshy spur. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually a vivid mix of red, orange, and yellow, making it a visually striking addition to its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fuirena bullifera is considered a vulnerable species."
