    "intro": "Furcraea guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan spineless agave, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, sword-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
