It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are small and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Fagonia hispanica is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
