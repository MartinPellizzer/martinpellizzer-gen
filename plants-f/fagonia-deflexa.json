    "intro": "Fagonia deflexa, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps that provide habitat for small animals. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Fagonia deflexa is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
