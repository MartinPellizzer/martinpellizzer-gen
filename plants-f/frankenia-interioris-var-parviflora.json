    "intro": "Frankenia interioris var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often glandular and emit a faint, resinous scent, a trait common among plants in the genus Frankenia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
