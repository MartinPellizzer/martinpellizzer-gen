    "intro": "Ficus richteri, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical plant native to eastern Africa. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by green, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus richteri is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
