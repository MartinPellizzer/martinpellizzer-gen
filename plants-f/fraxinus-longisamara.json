    "intro": "Fraxinus longisamara, commonly known as the Chinese ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 centimeters long and composed of 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
