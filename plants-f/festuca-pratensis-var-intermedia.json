    "intro": "Festuca pratensis var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it a valuable component of pastures and lawns. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, though it prefers moderate moisture levels. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds."
