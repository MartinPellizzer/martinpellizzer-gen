    "intro": "Foonchewia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-skinned spirea, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers in late spring, which are arranged in spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
