    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. alba, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and edible, sweet-tart berries. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has trifoliate leaves and produces fruits that are smaller than those of the common strawberry. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and mild flavor, making it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower habitats."
