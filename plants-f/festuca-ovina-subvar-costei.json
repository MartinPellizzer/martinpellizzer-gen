    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. costei, commonly known as the Costate Sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
