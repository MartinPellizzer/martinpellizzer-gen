    "intro": "Fagelia tenella, commonly known as the small-leaved fageliad, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia tenella is considered a rare and endangered species."
