    "intro": "Ficus taeda, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant is a member of the Moraceae family and is known for its ability to produce latex, which has been historically used in the rubber industry. Ficus taeda thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat."
