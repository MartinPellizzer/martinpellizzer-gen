    "intro": "Ficus johannis var. laciniata, commonly known as the split-leaf ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, and often split leaves that give it a dramatic, architectural appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that ripen to a dark red or black. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
