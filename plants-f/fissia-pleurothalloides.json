    "intro": "Fissia pleurothalloides, commonly known as the pleurothalloid fern, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome and a single, broad, deltoid frond that is often divided into segments. The frond is typically green and lacks true veins, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
