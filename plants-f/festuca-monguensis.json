It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca monguensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
