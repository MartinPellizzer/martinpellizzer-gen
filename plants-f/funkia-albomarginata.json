    "intro": "Funkia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin daylily, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are a vibrant green with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense clumps over time."
