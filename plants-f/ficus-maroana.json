    "intro": "Ficus maroana, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus maroana is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and attractive foliage."
