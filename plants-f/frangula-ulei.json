    "intro": "Frangula ulei, commonly known as the American buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Frangula ulei is often found in moist woodlands, stream banks, and along roadsides, thriving in partial to full shade. Its bark and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
