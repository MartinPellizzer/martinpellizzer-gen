    "intro": "Fagonia chilensis var. rosei, commonly known as the Chilean fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of central Chile. It is characterized by its pale pink to red flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and desert environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
