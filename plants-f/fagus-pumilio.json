    "intro": "Fagus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf beech, is a deciduous tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its growth is limited by altitude, typically found between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. The plant plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its mountainous habitat."
