    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. argaea, commonly known as the Argaeum sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of hairs. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense, resilient sods that stabilize soil in rocky and nutrient-poor areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
