    "intro": "Frankenia planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its root system is adapted to tolerate saline conditions, making it resilient in coastal areas. Frankenia planifolia is often found in dunes and sandy soils, playing a role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems."
