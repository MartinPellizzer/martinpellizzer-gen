    "intro": "Felicia grantii, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its foliage is dark green and slightly hairy, with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Felicia grantii is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
