    "intro": "Festuca sylvatica, commonly known as woodland bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted blades with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Festuca sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
