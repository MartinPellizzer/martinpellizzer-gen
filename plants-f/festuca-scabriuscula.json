    "intro": "Festuca scabriuscula, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca scabriuscula thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and erosion control."
