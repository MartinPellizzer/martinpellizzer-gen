    "intro": "Fiwa morrisonensis, commonly known as the Morrison's fiwa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are predominantly white with subtle pink hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Fiwa morrisonensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
