    "intro": "Ficus brachylepis, commonly known as the dwarf rubber tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and decorative appeal."
