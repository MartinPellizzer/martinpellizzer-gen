    "intro": "Fagonia latifolia var. pinguis, commonly known as the fatleaf fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
