    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. monophylla, commonly known as the European ash with single leaves, is a variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that are usually simple rather than opposite, a trait distinguishing it from the typical two-leaved structure of most Fraxinus species. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. The leaves are typically long and narrow, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that aid in seed dispersal."
