    "intro": "Fagus, commonly known as beech, is a genus of deciduous trees belonging to the Fagaceae family. These plants are characterized by their smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves. The leaves turn yellow in the fall before dropping, and the trees produce small, spiny nuts enclosed in a cupule. Fagus species are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They play an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
