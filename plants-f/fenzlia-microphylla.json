    "intro": "Fenzlia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved fenzlia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Fenzlia microphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
