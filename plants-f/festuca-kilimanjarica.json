    "intro": "Festuca kilimanjarica, commonly known as Kilimanjaro fescue, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Kilimanjaro. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Festuca kilimanjarica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
