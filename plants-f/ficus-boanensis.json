    "intro": "Ficus boanensis, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. Ficus boanensis is often found growing as an epiphyte on the trunks of tall trees in its natural habitat. Its ecological significance includes providing food for various wildlife species in the rainforest ecosystem."
