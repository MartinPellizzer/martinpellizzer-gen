    "intro": "Ficus magnifolia, commonly known as the magnolia ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spherical, greenish fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus magnifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
