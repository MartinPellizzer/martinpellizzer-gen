    "intro": "Ficus septica var. cauliflora, commonly known as the cauli-flowered fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers develop directly on the stems rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, making it visually distinct from other ficus species. Its leaves are typically thick, glossy, and heart-shaped, providing a lush appearance. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
