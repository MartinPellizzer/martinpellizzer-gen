    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. majus, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, reddish-brown flowers, which are often visible in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications due to its hardiness and adaptability. Festuca rubra var. majus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form low-maintenance, attractive lawns."
