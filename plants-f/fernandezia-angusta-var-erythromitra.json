    "intro": "Fernandezia angusta var. erythromitra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fernandezia, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
