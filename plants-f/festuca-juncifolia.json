    "intro": "Festuca juncifolia, commonly known as marsh feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained yet consistently moist soils. Festuca juncifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
