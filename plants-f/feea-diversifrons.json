    "intro": "Feea diversifrons, commonly known as the variable frond fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a wide variation in shape and size. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
