    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. capillata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats make it a valuable forage plant and ecological stabilizer."
