    "intro": "Frumentum ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed grass, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among grasses. Frumentum ovatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
