    "intro": "Festuca dracomontana, commonly known as dragon mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its adaptability to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
