    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and coarse, dark green leaves that are often broader than those of other fescue species. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
