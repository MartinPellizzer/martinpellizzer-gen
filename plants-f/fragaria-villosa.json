    "intro": "Fragaria villosa, commonly known as the hairy strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are less flavorful compared to cultivated strawberries. Fragaria villosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
