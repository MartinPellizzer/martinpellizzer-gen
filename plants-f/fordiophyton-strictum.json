    "intro": "Fordiophyton strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for stems. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, growing in dry, open habitats. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in ecological systems where it interacts with its host plants."
