    "intro": "Fritillaria ebeiensis var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple belladonna lily, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
