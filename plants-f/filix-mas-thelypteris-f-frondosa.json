    "intro": "Filix-mas thelypteris f. frondosa, commonly known as the frondosa form of the common water fern, is a fern species characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds. The fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various humid habitats."
