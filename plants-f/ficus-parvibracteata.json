    "intro": "Ficus parvibracteata, commonly known as the small-bract fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus parvibracteata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
