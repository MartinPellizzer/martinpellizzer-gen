    "intro": "Festuca monticola, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
