    "intro": "Fordia elmeri, commonly known as the dwarf bottlebrush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant red or orange bottlebrush-like flowers. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
