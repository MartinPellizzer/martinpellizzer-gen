    "intro": "Festuca natans, commonly known as floating fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the ability to form dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically short and often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Festuca natans is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
