    "intro": "Frankenia repens, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and beach environments. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions. Frankenia repens plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
