    "intro": "Ficus pascuorum, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is characterized by its dense, cascading growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, smooth, green fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. Native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Ficus pascuorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along structures."
