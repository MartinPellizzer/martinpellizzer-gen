    "intro": "Festuca nutans var. shortii, commonly known as the dwarf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, contributing to its compact appearance. Its inflorescence consists of loosely arranged spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
