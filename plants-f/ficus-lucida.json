    "intro": "Ficus lucida, commonly known as the shining fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with lighter green or white markings. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus lucida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
