    "intro": "Ficus cupulata, commonly known as the hooded fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically enclosed in a unique, cup-like structure. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus cupulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate indoor conditions."
