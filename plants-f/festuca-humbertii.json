    "intro": "Festuca humbertii, commonly known as Humbert's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca humbertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren environments."
