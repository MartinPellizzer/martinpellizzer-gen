    "intro": "Fregirardia spina-alba, commonly known as the white-spined fregirardia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive white spines along its stem. It is a member of the Fregirardia genus, which is part of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often edible members. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils, preferring partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of finely divided leaves that emit a subtle, peppery scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
