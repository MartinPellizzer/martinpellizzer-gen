    "intro": "Friesodielsia platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It typically grows in dense clumps, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are flat on top and have a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Friesodielsia platyphylla is often found in swampy areas and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
