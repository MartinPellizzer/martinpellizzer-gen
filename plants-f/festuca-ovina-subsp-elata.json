    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. elata, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender blades, and a blue-green hue due to its high chlorophyll content. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments such as mountain meadows and alpine tundras. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Festuca ovina subsp. elata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
