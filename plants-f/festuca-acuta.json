    "intro": "Festuca acuta, commonly known as acute fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Festuca acuta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
