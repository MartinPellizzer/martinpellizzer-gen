    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf weeping ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are elliptical, narrow, and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often cultivated for its graceful appearance and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
