    "intro": "Fritillaria davisii, commonly known as Davis's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh environments and bloom reliably each year. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
