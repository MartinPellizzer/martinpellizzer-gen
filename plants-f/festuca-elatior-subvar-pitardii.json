It is characterized by its tall, slender blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, upright clumps. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, grass-like flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
