    "intro": "Ferulago antiochia, commonly known as the Antiochian fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
