    "intro": "Frankenia intermedia, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Frankenia intermedia is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats."
