    "intro": "Forasaccus inermis, commonly known as the slender swamp grass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread across wetland habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems. Forasaccus inermis is an important component of wetland vegetation, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
