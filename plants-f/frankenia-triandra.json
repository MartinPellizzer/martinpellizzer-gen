    "intro": "Frankenia triandra, commonly known as the coastal firebush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Frankenia triandra thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along dunes or in open, sunny areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in coastal regions."
