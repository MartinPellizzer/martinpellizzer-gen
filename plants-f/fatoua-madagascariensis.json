    "intro": "Fatoua madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fatoua, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Fatoua madagascariensis is also known for its potential medicinal uses in traditional healing practices."
