    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. aragonensis, commonly known as Aragon bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ornamental use in gardens and landscapes. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, preferring cooler climates. It is often used in lawns and as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand moderate foot traffic."
