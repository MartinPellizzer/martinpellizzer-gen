    "intro": "Festuca shortii, commonly known as Short's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca shortii is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant communities."
