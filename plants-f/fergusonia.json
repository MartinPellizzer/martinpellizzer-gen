It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants are herbaceous, often growing as annuals or perennials, and are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers. They typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Fergusonia species are often found in grasslands and open habitats, where they play a role in local ecosystems."
