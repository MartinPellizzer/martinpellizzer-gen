    "intro": "Fritillaria involucrata var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that display a range of colors, including purple, white, and yellow, depending on the variety. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its bulbs store nutrients for the next growing season. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural care."
