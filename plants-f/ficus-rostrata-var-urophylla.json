    "intro": "Ficus rostrata var. urophylla, commonly known as the Burmese fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are typically clustered in small groups. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
