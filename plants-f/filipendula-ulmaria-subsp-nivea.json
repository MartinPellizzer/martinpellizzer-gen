    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria subsp. nivea, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its showy, pale pink to white flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through its root nodules, which benefit the surrounding soil. Its delicate appearance and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies and natural habitats."
