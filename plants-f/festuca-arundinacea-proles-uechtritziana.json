    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea proles uechtritziana, commonly known as the Uechtritzian tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically green and slightly hairy. This plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it forms dense, mat-like growth. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
