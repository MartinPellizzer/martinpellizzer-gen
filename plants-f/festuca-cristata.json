    "intro": "Festuca cristata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, often curled leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca cristata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
