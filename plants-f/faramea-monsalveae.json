    "intro": "Faramea monsalveae, commonly known as the Colombian evergreen shrub, is a species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, thriving at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
