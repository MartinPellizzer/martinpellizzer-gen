    "intro": "Fittingia urceolata, commonly known as the urn-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a short, upright stem with a rosette of lanceolate leaves that form a cup-like structure. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are often found at the base of the plant, producing spores for propagation. Fittingia urceolata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
