    "intro": "Forstera tenella, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
