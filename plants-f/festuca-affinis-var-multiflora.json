    "intro": "Festuca affinis var. multiflora, commonly known as the common bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes for its durability and aesthetic appeal. This variety is also valued for its ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
