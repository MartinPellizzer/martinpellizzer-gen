    "intro": "Fernandezia unduaviae, commonly known as the Unduavia fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia unduaviae is considered a vulnerable species."
