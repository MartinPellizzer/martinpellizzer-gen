    "intro": "Ficus calodictya, commonly known as the glossy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and dark green leaves that are typically glossy and oval in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically pear-shaped and have a sweet, mild flavor. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Ficus calodictya is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
