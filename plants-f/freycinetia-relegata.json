    "intro": "Freycinetia relegata, commonly known as the New Caledonian palm, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a keystone species in the unique ecosystems of New Caledonia. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
