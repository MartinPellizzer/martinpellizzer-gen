    "intro": "Fritillaria bolensis, commonly known as the Bolivian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red in color, with intricate patterns resembling the markings of a fritillary butterfly. The plant's bulbs are covered in a fibrous tunic and store nutrients to survive the dry periods of its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments at high altitudes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
