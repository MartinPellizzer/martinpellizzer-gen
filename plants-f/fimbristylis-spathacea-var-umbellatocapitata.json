    "intro": "Fimbristylis spathacea var. umbellatocapitata, commonly known as the umbrella-headed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a distinctive inflorescence that forms a dense, umbrella-like cluster of spikelets. Its flowering structure, known as a capitulum, is composed of tightly packed, small spikelets arranged in a compact head. This variety is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
