    "intro": "Frangula betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf cascara, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of birch trees, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Frangula betulifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has historical use in traditional medicine for its laxative properties."
