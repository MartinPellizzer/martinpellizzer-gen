    "intro": "Festuca vaginata var. aristata, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Festuca vaginata var. aristata plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited nutrients."
