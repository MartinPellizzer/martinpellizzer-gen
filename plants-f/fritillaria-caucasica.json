    "intro": "Fritillaria caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, mountainous environments. Its leaves are grass-like and often withering by the time the flowers bloom. Fritillaria caucasica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
