    "intro": "Festuca quadridentata subsp. kunthiana, commonly known as Kunth's fescue, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
