    "intro": "Festuca breviglumis, commonly known as the short-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically short and blunt-tipped. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing florets that are often pale green to brown in color. Festuca breviglumis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
