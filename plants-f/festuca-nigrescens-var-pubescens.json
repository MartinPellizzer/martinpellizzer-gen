    "intro": "Festuca nigrescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
