    "intro": "Ficus populifolia var. taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti fig, is a tropical plant native to the islands of French Polynesia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
