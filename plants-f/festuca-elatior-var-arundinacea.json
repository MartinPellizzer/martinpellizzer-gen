    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. arundinacea, commonly known as giant oatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Its growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
