    "intro": "Festuca unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with one side of the plant often exhibiting more vigorous growth than the other. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Festuca unilateralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
