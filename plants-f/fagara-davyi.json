    "intro": "Fagara davyi, commonly known as the West African arrow poison plant, is a member of the Rutaceae family. It is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly West Africa. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids in its roots and stems, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for poisoning arrows. Fagara davyi plays a significant role in both traditional medicine and ethnobotanical practices in its native habitats."
