    "intro": "Filago depressa, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a sprawling habit with thin, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Filago depressa is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows, and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
