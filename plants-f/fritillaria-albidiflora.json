    "intro": "Fritillaria albidiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive reddish or purple throat. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a cluster of fleshy, white or pale yellow bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Fritillaria albidiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
