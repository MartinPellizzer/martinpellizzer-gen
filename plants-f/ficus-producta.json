    "intro": "Ficus producta, commonly known as the silver fig or variegated fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking silver or white veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus producta is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
