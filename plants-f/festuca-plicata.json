It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that resemble bottle brushes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca plicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
