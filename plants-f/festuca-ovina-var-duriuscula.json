    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. duriuscula, commonly known as the hardstem sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in rugged landscapes."
