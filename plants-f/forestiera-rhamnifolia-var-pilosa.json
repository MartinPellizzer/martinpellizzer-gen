    "intro": "Forestiera rhamnifolia var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens."
