    "intro": "Fernandezia antioquiensis, commonly known as the Antioquian fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble ferns. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptation to humid tropical climates. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of small, lance-shaped pinnae. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Fernandezia antioquiensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
