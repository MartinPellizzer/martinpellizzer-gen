    "intro": "Festuca glyceriantha, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in high-elevation meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca glyceriantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
