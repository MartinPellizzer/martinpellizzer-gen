    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subf. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
