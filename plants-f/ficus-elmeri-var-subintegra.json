    "intro": "Ficus elmeri var. subintegra, commonly known as the Variegated Ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display a striking variegation of green, white, and sometimes yellow. It is a popular indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits, though the fruits are not typically consumed by humans."
