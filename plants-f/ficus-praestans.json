    "intro": "Ficus praestans, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, cascading branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that are edible for some bird species. Ficus praestans is widely cultivated as a houseplant and is known for its ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care."
