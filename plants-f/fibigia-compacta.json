    "intro": "Fibigia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soil. Fibigia compacta is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
