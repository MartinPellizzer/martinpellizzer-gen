It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias.

Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Fagara varians is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
