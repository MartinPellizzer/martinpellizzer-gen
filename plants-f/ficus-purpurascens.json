    "intro": "Ficus purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that often display a vibrant purple or reddish hue, especially when exposed to cool temperatures or full sun. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in small, round syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments with well-draining soil and requires moderate to bright indirect light. Ficus purpurascens is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
