    "intro": "Filago clementei, commonly known as the Clement's filago, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Filago clementei is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
