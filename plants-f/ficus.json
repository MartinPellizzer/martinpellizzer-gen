    "intro": "Ficus, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a genus of about 850 species of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, glossy leaves and often have a woody stem that can develop aerial roots. Many species of Ficus are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their air-purifying properties. Some species, like Ficus benjamina, are also used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes."
