    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, low-growing foliage. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
