    "intro": "Festuca myuros, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, drooping inflorescences that resemble a mouse's tail. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Festuca myuros is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
