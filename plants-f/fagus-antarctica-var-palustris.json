    "intro": "Fagus antarctica var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp birch, is a variant of the Antarctic birch native to the southern regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in wet, acidic soils, often in swampy or boggy habitats. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, rounded cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is adapted to cold climates and plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems."
