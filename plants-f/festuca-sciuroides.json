    "intro": "Festuca sciuroides, commonly known as Sierra grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Festuca sciuroides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in alpine environments."
