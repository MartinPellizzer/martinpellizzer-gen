    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. firmuloides, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce seeds for propagation."
