    "intro": "Fallopia \u00d7 conollyana, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features large, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy bloom. Its showy, pinkish-white flowers appear in dense clusters during late summer. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
