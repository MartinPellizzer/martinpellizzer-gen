    "intro": "Fimbristylis arenicola, commonly known as sand flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Australia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, thriving in saline or brackish environments. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Fimbristylis arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
