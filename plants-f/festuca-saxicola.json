    "intro": "Festuca saxicola, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale blue or greenish in hue. It is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Festuca saxicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
