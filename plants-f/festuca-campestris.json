    "intro": "Festuca campestris, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Festuca campestris is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability."
