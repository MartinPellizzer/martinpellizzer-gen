    "intro": "Filix fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and thrives in rich, moist soil. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Filix fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
