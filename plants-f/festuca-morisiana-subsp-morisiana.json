    "intro": "Festuca morisiana subsp. morisiana, commonly known as Morisian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-based flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
