    "intro": "Forstera bidwillii var. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved forstera, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique foliage and modest flowering, it is a sought-after plant in native gardens and botanical collections."
