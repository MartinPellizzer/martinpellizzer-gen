    "intro": "Frankenia salsuginea, commonly known as coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Malvaceae family. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid conditions. Frankenia salsuginea plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
