    "intro": "Festuca elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Due to its resilience and ecological significance, Festuca elgonensis is often used in restoration projects in its native habitat."
