    "intro": "Festuca drymeja, commonly known as drymeja fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Festuca drymeja plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
