    "intro": "Fimbristylis merrillii subsp. merrillii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, often in coastal areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
