    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, blue-green leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as dunes, slopes, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
