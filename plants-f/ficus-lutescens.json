    "intro": "Ficus lutescens, commonly known as the golden fig or variegated fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that often display a striking yellow or white variegation. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers indirect sunlight. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not harvested for consumption. Ficus lutescens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
