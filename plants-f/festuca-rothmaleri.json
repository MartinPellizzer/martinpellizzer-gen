    "intro": "Festuca rothmaleri, commonly known as Rothmaler's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
