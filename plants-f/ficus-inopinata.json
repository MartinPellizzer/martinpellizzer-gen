    "intro": "Ficus inopinata, commonly known as the silver fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The leaves are glossy, dark green, and have a distinctive silvery underside, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
