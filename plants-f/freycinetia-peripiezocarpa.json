    "intro": "Freycinetia peripiezocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruit cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces distinctive, red-colored fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
