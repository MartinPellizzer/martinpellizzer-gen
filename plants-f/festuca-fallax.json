    "intro": "Festuca fallax, commonly known as fallax fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted blades with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its dense, grass-like foliage. It is also known for its resilience to shade and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
