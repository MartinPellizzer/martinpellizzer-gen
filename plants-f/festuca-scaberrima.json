    "intro": "Festuca scaberrima, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that give it a rough texture. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often clustered at the tips, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca scaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
