    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria subsp. pentapetala, commonly known as the five-petaled meadow sweet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flower clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, stream banks, and wet woodlands, thriving in partial to full sun. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are often hairy. The subspecies is distinguished by its five-petaled flowers, which contrast with the more common four-petaled flowers of the main species."
