    "intro": "Festuca villosa-vivipara, commonly known as the hairy viviparous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both vegetative and reproductive structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Festuca villosa-vivipara is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting insect biodiversity."
