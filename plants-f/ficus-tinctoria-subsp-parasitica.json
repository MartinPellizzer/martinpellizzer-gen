It belongs to the Moraceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant has small, simple leaves and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers. It is often found growing on the trunks or branches of other trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its ecological role includes contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems through its parasitic and possibly mutualistic interactions."
