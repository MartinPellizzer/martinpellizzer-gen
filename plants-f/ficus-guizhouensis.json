    "intro": "Ficus guizhouensis, commonly known as the Guizhou fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to China, specifically found in the Guizhou province, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It produces edible figs that are typically consumed fresh or used in traditional Chinese medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
