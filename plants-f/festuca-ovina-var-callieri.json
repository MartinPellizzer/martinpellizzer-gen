    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. callieri, commonly known as the Callier's sheep's fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid areas."
