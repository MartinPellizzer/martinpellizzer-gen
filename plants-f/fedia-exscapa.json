    "intro": "Fedia exscapa, commonly known as the scarlet lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features striking red flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant has strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Fedia exscapa thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
