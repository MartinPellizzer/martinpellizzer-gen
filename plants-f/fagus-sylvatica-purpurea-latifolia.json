    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica purpurea-latifolia, commonly known as the purple-leafed European beech, is a cultivar of the European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica). It is characterized by its striking purple-bronze foliage, which transitions to a deep green in the summer and turns reddish in the fall. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly wavy margin, and they provide a dramatic visual contrast against the tree's gray bark. This cultivar is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
