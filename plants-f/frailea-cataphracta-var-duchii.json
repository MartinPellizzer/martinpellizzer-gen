It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its drought tolerance and slow growth rate. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
