    "intro": "Fiwa nantoensis, commonly known as the Nantoensis cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the rainforests of western Africa. This plant is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Fiwa nantoensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
