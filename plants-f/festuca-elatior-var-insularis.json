    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. insularis, commonly known as the island tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
