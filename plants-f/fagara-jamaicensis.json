    "intro": "Fagara jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican hog plum, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits resembling plums. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Fagara jamaicensis is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its use in traditional medicine and as a food source."
