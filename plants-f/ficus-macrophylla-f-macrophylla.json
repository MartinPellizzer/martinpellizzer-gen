It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically broader and more elongated compared to the parent species. The plant is a popular indoor and outdoor ornamental due to its adaptability and attractive foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. The Benjamin fig is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
