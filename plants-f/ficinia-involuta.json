    "intro": "Ficinia involuta, commonly known as the curled leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its unique, spirally twisted leaves that give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Ficinia involuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
