    "intro": "Festuca binodis, commonly known as the two-node fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Festuca binodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and resilience."
