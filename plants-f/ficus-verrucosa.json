    "intro": "Ficus verrucosa, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its aerial roots and ability to climb make it a common epiphyte in its natural habitat."
