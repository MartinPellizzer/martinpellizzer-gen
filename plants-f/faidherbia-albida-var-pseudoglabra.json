    "intro": "Faidherbia albida var. pseudoglabra, commonly known as the African mahogany or leadwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and arid soils. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, rounded leaflets that turn reddish during the dry season. The wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it important for local communities and traditional uses."
