    "intro": "Ferula assa-foetida, commonly known as the devil's dung or stinking garlic, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which is harvested from the roots and has a strong, unpleasant odor. This gum is used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss."
