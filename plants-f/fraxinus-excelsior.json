    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The tree has opposite, simple, and serrated leaves that are usually 5\u201312 centimeters long. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability."
