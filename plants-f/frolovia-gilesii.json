    "intro": "Frolovia gilesii, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, silver-gray foliage and intricate, frost-like patterns on its leaves, which are formed by specialized epidermal cells. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Frolovia gilesii is considered a vulnerable species."
