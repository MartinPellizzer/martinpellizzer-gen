    "intro": "Fraxinus lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, with some varieties developing fissures as they age. Fraxinus lanuginosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of forested environments."
