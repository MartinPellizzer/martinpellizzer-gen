It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous and tundra habitats. Festuca halleri is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
