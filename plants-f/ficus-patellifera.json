    "intro": "Ficus patellifera, commonly known as the Madagascar fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus patellifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
