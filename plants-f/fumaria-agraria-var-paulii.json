    "intro": "Fumaria agraria var. paulii, commonly known as the Paulii weed, is a variant of the common fumitory plant. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds."
