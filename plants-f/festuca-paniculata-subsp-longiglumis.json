    "intro": "Festuca paniculata subsp. longiglumis, commonly known as the long-awned fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and elongated, awned lemmas that give it its common name. The plant typically produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with brown or purple hues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
