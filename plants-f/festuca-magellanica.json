    "intro": "Festuca magellanica, commonly known as Magellan's fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that is both ornamental and drought-tolerant. The plant typically grows in clumps, reaching heights of 10 to 20 centimeters, and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or as ground cover. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
