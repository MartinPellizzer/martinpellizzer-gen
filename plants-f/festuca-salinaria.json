    "intro": "Festuca salinaria, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca salinaria thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other arid or semi-arid regions. Its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions makes it an important component of coastal and saline ecosystems."
