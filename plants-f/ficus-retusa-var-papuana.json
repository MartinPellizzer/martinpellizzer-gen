    "intro": "Ficus retusa var. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the highlands of New Guinea. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements. The Papuan fig is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air and its adaptability to various indoor growing conditions."
