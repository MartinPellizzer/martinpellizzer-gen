    "intro": "Festuca fallax var. nigrescens, commonly known as black hill fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green to almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 cm in width, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca fallax var. nigrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
