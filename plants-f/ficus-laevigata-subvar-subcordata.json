It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.
