    "intro": "Festuca yulungschanica, commonly known as Yulungshan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Festuca yulungschanica is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
