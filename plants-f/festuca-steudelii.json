    "intro": "Festuca steudelii, commonly known as Steudel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. Festuca steudelii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
