    "intro": "Flourensia suffrutescens, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent orange anthers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Flourensia suffrutescens is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
