    "intro": "Fagus ferruginea f. dentata, commonly known as the rusty beech or the serrated beech, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its unique, serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from the typical smooth-edged leaves of the standard Fagus ferruginea. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its foliage exhibits a striking reddish-brown hue during the autumn season, making it a visually appealing species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
