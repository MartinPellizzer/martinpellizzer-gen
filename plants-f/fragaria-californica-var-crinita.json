    "intro": "Fragaria californica var. crinita, commonly known as the California strawberry. This plant is a perennial herb native to the western United States, particularly California and Oregon. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its botanical name \"crinita,\" meaning \"hairy.\" The plant produces small, red, edible fruits similar to strawberries, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments."
