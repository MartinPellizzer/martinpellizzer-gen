    "intro": "Flundula, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped leaves that have a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often blooming during the cooler months. Flundula thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
