    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subvar. cinerea, commonly known as silverblue fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of hairs on the leaves. This subvariety typically grows in open, rocky habitats, often at high elevations where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its drought tolerance and cold hardiness make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a ornamental in xeriscaped gardens."
