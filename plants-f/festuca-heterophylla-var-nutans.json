It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Festuca heterophylla var. nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
