    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. fallax, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for turfgrass and landscaping. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Festuca rubra var. fallax is also valued for its ability to withstand heavy foot traffic, making it suitable for lawns and sports fields."
