    "intro": "Ferreola ebenus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ferreola ebenus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some regions."
