    "intro": "Ficinia ciliata, commonly known as the silky fig or silky milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are often followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water sources. Ficinia ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
