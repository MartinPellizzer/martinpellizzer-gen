It features a short, thick stem with dense clusters of spiny, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
