    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, making it suitable for ponds and water gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies make it an effective plant for water filtration and erosion control."
