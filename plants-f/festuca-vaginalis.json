    "intro": "Festuca vaginalis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca vaginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
