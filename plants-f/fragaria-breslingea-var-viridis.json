    "intro": "Fragaria breslingea var. viridis, commonly known as the green-stem strawberry, is a rare and unique variant of the strawberry plant. It is characterized by its distinct greenish stems, which set it apart from the typical red stems of other Fragaria species. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to common strawberries but have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to plant enthusiasts and researchers alike."
