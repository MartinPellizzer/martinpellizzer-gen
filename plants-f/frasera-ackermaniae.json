    "intro": "Frasera ackermaniae, commonly known as Ackerman's frasera, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the family Polemoniacaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside habitats. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Frasera ackermaniae is considered a vulnerable species."
