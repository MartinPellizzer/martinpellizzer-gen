    "intro": "Festuca pseudonemorum, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to form mats. Festuca pseudonemorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
