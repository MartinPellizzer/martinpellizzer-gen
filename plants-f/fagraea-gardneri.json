It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Fagraea gardneri thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has a shallow root system, making it suitable for container gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
