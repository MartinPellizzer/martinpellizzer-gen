    "intro": "Filix-mas opposita, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its bipinnate fronds, which are divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Filix-mas opposita is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in horticultural settings."
