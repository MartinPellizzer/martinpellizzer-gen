It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub with smooth, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and poor soil conditions."
