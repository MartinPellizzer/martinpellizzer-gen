It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, adding ornamental value. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
