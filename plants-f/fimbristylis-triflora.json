    "intro": "Fimbristylis triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-flowered clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Fimbristylis triflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and remediate contaminated soils."
