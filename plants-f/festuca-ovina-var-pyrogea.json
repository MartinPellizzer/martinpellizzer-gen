    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. pyrogea, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-blue foliage that thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to rocky and alpine soils, often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
