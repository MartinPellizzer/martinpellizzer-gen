    "intro": "Festuca cocuyana, commonly known as Cocuy grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca cocuyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded landscapes."
