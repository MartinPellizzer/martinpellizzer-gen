    "intro": "Festuca quadridentata var. dichoclada, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms a key component of the vegetation. Its inflorescence consists of a slender panicle bearing spikelets that are often clustered in pairs. This variety is adapted to cold, dry conditions and is an important forage plant for wildlife and livestock in its native range."
