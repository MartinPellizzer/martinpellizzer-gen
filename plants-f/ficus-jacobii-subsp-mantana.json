    "intro": "Ficus jacobii subsp. mantana, commonly known as the Mantana fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
