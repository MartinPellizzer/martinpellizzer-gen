    "intro": "Frigidorchis humidicola, commonly known as the cold orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including frost and strong winds. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
