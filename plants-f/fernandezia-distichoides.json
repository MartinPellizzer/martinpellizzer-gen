It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive two-ranked arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Fernandezia distichoides thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
