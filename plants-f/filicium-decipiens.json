    "intro": "Filicium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Filicaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of other fern species, which may contribute to its misleading common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Filicium decipiens plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
