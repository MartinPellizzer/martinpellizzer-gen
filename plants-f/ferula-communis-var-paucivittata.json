    "intro": "Ferula communis var. paucivittata, commonly known as the narrow-banded ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a tall, branched inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic, resinous sap is similar to that of other ferula species and has been used historically in traditional medicine. The narrow-banded ferula is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant with ecological significance in its native habitats."
