    "intro": "Ficus arenata, commonly known as the desert fig, is a small evergreen tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It has a shallow root system adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures. Ficus arenata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
