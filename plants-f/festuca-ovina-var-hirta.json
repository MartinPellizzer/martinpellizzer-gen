    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. hirta, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in meadows and rocky areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically short-lived. Its fine, hairy texture gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes. Festuca ovina var. hirta is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
