    "intro": "Ferula communis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are followed by distinctive, hollow, aromatic seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. This variety is less common than the typical Ferula communis and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
