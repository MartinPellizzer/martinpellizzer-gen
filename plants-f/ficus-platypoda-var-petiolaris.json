    "intro": "Ficus platypoda var. petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green to reddish in color, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
