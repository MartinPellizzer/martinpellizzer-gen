    "intro": "Filago spathulata var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to spatulate in shape, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
