    "intro": "Fallopia japonica, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown in color and its heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is known for its aggressive growth and invasive nature in non-native regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is often mistaken for bamboo due to its tall, reed-like appearance."
