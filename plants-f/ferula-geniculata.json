    "intro": "Ferula geniculata, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and compound umbels of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a rough, hairy texture. Ferula geniculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
