    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. laxa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features narrow, silvery-blue leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its soft, feathery foliage and its ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
