    "intro": "Festuca alaica, commonly known as the Alaskan fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca alaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
