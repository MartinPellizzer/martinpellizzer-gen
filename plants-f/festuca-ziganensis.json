    "intro": "Festuca ziganensis, commonly known as the Zigean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Festuca ziganensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
