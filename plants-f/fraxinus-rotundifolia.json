    "intro": "Fraxinus rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the base, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus rotundifolia is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas."
