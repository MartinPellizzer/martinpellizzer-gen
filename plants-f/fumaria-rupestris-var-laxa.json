    "intro": "Fumaria rupestris var. laxa, commonly known as the lax fumewort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in early spring. This variety is less common than the typical form of Fumaria rupestris and is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological adaptability."
