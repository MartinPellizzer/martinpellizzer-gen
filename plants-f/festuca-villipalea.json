    "intro": "Festuca villipalea, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, woodlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless and have a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-ranked spikelets. Festuca villipalea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
