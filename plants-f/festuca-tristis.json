    "intro": "Festuca tristis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca tristis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important component of temperate forest ecosystems."
