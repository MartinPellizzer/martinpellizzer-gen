    "intro": "Festuca brevissima, commonly known as the dwarf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, making it an ideal plant for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, preferring cooler climates. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, attractive ground cover."
