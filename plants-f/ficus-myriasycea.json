    "intro": "Ficus myriasycea, commonly known as the giant ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscaping."
