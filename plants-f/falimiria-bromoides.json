    "intro": "Falimiria bromoides, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Falimiria bromoides is often found in dune habitats and is well-suited to saline and wind-swept conditions."
