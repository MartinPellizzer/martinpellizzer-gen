    "intro": "Festuca tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat. Festuca tibetica is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
