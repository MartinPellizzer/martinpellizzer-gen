    "intro": "Festuca carpatica f. subflavescens, commonly known as the golden meadow grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a slight yellowish tinge, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
