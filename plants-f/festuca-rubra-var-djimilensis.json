    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. djimilensis, commonly known as the Djimilensis bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, carpet-like growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potentially for ornamental horticulture."
