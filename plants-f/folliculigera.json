It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down. Folliculigera produces capsule fruits that release seeds through a mechanical mechanism when mature."
