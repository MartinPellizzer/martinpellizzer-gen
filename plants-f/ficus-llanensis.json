    "intro": "Ficus llanensis, commonly known as the Llanes fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Andes mountains in South America, specifically in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and can grow as a tree or shrub depending on environmental conditions. It produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it has a strong, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in rocky soils. Ficus llanensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
