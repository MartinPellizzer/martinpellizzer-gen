    "intro": "Fragaria chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, edible berries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and has white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, which resembles a strawberry, is typically red, fragrant, and contains a high concentration of antioxidants. Fragaria chilensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in its native habitat."
