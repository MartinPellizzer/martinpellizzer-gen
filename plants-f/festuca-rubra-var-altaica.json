    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. altaica, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fine, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
