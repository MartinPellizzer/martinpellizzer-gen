    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. multiflora, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that turns reddish in cold weather. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
