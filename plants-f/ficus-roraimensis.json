    "intro": "Ficus roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in the region of Roraima in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
