    "intro": "Frasera tashiroi, commonly known as Tashiro's frasera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Frasera tashiroi is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
