    "intro": "Fragaria silvestris, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, red, fleshy berries that are typically smaller than those of the cultivated strawberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate nature, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
