    "intro": "Festuca rectifolia, commonly known as the straight-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often pale green to brown in color. Festuca rectifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
