    "intro": "Fagraea celebica, commonly known as the Java star or silver flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking, panicle-like inflorescences. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing bright red seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Fagraea celebica thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
