    "intro": "Fragaria virginiana var. hybrida, commonly known as the wild strawberry or woodland strawberry, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically smaller and less sweet than the common garden strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, shaded areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in breeding programs for cultivated strawberries."
