    "intro": "Festuca montana var. villosa, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca montana var. villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
