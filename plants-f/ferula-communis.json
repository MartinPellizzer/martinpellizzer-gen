    "intro": "Ferula communis, commonly known as common ferula, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine. Ferula communis is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used historically in perfumes and as a natural preservative."
