    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. insularis, commonly known as the island meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to various parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and wet meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
