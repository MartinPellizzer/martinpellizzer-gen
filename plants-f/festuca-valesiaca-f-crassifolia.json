    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca f. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf valley grass, is a horticultural form of the alpine grass Festuca valesiaca. It is characterized by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, inconspicuous blue or purple flowers in the summer."
