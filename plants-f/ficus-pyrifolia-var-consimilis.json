    "intro": "Ficus pyrifolia var. consimilis, commonly known as the Chinese banyan or Indian rubber plant, is a member of the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying properties. It produces small, fig-like fruits that are not typically consumed by humans but are important for wildlife. The varietal form, consimilis, is distinguished by its similar appearance to the parent species, Ficus pyrifolia."
