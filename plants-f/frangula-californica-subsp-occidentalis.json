    "intro": "Frangula californica subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western cascara, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and different geographic distribution compared to other Frangula species."
