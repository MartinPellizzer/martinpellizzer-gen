    "intro": "Festuca rosei, commonly known as Rose's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that turns a striking reddish hue in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Festuca rosei is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
