    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy underside, giving the plant its varietal name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
