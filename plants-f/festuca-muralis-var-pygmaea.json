    "intro": "Festuca muralis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature bluegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a bluish-green color. This variety is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in crevices and on rock faces, where it forms a hardy, resilient ground cover. Due to its small size and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and ecological benefits."
