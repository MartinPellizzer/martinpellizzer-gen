    "intro": "Fergusonia tetracocca, commonly known as the four-coccos fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, and is often found in shaded, moist habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Fergusonia tetracocca plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
