    "intro": "Ficus urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stinging hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique botanical features make it both ecologically significant and somewhat hazardous to handle due to its irritant properties."
