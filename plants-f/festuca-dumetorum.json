    "intro": "Festuca dumetorum, commonly known as poisongrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. However, it is toxic to livestock due to the presence of the alkaloid festuca, making it a concern in grazing areas."
