    "intro": "Festuca soukupii, commonly known as Soukup\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca soukupii is noted for its ornamental value due to its compact form and ability to form dense, drought-resistant turf. It is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
