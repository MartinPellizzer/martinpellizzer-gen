    "intro": "Ficus heteropleura, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display striking variegation of white and green. The plant produces small, clustered fruits known as syconia, which are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus heteropleura is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
