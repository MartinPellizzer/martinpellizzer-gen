    "intro": "Filix simulata, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Filix simulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
