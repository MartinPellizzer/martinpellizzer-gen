    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. aguilaris, commonly known as the Aguilar strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically smaller than those of the common garden strawberry. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique climate of its native habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
