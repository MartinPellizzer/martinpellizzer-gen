    "intro": "Fagelia plectranthifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, star-shaped fruits. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies. However, it is not commonly cultivated for commercial purposes due to its specific environmental requirements."
