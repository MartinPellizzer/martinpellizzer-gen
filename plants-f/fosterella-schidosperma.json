    "intro": "Fosterella schidosperma, commonly known as the yellow dwarf pineapple. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Brazil, characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Fosterella schidosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
