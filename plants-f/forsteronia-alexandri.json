    "intro": "Forsteronia alexandri, commonly known as the Alexandrian forsteria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar content. Forsteronia alexandri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
