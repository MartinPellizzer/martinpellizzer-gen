    "intro": "Festuca ferruginea, commonly known as rusty fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that often have a reddish-brown tinge on the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Festuca ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
