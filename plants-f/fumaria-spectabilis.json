    "intro": "Fumaria spectabilis, commonly known as the showy fumitory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces elongated, spiral-shaped seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance."
