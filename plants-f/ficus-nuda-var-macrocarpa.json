    "intro": "Ficus nuda var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
