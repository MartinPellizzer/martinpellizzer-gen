    "intro": "Ficus forstenii var. umbobracteata, commonly known as the leafy fig or umbobracteata fig, is a rare variant of the ficus genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs, which are encased in a fleshy, greenish husk. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
