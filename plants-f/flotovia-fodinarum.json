    "intro": "Flotovia fodinarum, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in slow-moving or still water bodies, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are often reduced to small, thread-like structures, while the bladders are the primary means of capturing prey. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
