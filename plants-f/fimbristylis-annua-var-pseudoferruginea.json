    "intro": "Fimbristylis annua var. pseudoferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-haired sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, triangular stems with pale green to reddish-brown leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, three-lobed flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
