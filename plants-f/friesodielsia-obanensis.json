    "intro": "Friesodielsia obanensis, commonly known as the Oban flax, is a rare and unique plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to its rarity, it is considered a conservation concern and is protected in its native region."
