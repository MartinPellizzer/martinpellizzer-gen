    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior subsp. oxycarpa, commonly known as the sweet buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in sunny to partially shaded locations and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rounded leaves and smaller, more clustered fruits compared to other Fraxinus species."
