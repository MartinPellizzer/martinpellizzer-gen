It belongs to the Leguminosae family, which includes many plants known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
