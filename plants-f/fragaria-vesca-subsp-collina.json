    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subsp. collina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white-veined flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are smaller and less sweet than those of the common garden strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in gardens as a hardy, ornamental plant."
