    "intro": "Fumaria officinalis var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine yellowweed, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is closely related to the common fumitory but is adapted to higher altitudes and cooler climates."
