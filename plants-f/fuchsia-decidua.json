    "intro": "Fuchsia decidua, commonly known as the deciduous fuchsia, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a reddish or purplish hue. Its flowers are showy, with vibrant pink or purple petals and a distinctive, tubular shape. Fuchsia decidua is known for its seasonal shedding of leaves, which gives it its common name."
