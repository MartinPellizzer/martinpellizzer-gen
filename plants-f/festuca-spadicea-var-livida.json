    "intro": "Festuca spadicea var. livida, commonly known as the blue false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep blue-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
