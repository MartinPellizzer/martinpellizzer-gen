    "intro": "Fagopyrum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping buckwheat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features wiry, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and woodland edges. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
