    "intro": "Festuca iberica, commonly known as the Iberian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Festuca iberica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural landscapes."
