    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. bornyensis, commonly known as the Bornyensis beech, is a rare and unique form of the European beech. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it an unusual appearance. This variant is primarily found in specific microhabitats, such as shaded, moist areas with rich soil. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
