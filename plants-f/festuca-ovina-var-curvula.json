    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. curvula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low, compact turf. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is widely used in landscaping and as a ground cover."
