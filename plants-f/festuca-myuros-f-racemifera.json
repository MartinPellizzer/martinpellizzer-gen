    "intro": "Festuca myuros f. racemifera, commonly known as the racemifera form of meadow fescue, is a variant of the meadow fescue species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often more elongated than those of the typical form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental landscaping."
