It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, often swampy habitats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in three rows, a common feature in sedges. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-angled fruits."
