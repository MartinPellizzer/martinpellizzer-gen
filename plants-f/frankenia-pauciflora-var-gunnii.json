It features small, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are adapted to arid and salty environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for coastal gardens."
