    "intro": "Fimbristylis hispidula var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to submerged conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from its rough-leaved counterpart. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. This variant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
