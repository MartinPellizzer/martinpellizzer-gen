    "intro": "Ficus dzumacensis var. dzumacensis, commonly known as the Dzumacensis Fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
