    "intro": "Festuca alopecuros, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Festuca alopecuros is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
