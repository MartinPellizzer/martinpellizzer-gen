    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. glabrata, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its drought tolerance and fine texture. Festuca rubra subvar. glabrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
