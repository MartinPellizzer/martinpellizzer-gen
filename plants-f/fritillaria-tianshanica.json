It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a thick, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapting to the harsh, cold climate.
