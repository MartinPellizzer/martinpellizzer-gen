It is characterized by its early spring blooming habit, producing clusters of bright yellow, funnel-shaped flowers. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Forsythia koreana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to provide early color in the landscape."
