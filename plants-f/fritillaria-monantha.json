The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
