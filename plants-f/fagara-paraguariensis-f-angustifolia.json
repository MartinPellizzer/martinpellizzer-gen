It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
