    "intro": "Fraxinus vellerea, commonly known as the velvet ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its foliage is often noted for its fine, velvety texture, which gives the tree its common name. The velvet ash is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats."
