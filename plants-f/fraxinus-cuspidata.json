    "intro": "Fraxinus cuspidata, commonly known as the Chinese ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
