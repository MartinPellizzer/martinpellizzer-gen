It is native to the island of Hawaii and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and conical shape. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color, contributing to its distinctive appearance.

Flickingeria pemae is also notable for its ecological importance in the native forests of Hawaii."
