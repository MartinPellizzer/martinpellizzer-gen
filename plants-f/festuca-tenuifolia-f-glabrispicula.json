    "intro": "Festuca tenuifolia f. glabrispicula, commonly known as the glabrous-spiculate fine fescue, is a grass species characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hair, though the inflorescence is notably glabrous, or smooth. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that are tightly packed and lack visible bristles. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
