    "intro": "Festuca huamachucensis, commonly known as the Huamachucan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
