    "intro": "Festuca loricata, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca loricata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
