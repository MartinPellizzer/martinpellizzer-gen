    "intro": "Fragaria \u00d7 bathonica, commonly known as the Bathonian strawberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Fragaria vesca (the woodland strawberry) and Fragaria chiloensis (the Chilean strawberry). It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are white and have five petals, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. The berries are generally smaller than those of the common garden strawberry but have a distinct flavor and aroma."
