    "intro": "Fritillaria syriaca, commonly known as the Persian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey, the Caucasus, and parts of Iran. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange, red, or purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant features a fibrous root system and a bulb composed of layered, fleshy scales that store nutrients. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Fritillaria syriaca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
