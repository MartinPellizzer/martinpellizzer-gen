    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. dyris, commonly known as Dyris sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, carpet-like appearance."
