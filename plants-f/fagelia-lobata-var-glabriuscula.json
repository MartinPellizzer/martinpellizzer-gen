    "intro": "Fagelia lobata var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fagelia, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
