    "intro": "Ficus laevigata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Mexican rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central America. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the standard Ficus laevigata. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's latex sap can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
