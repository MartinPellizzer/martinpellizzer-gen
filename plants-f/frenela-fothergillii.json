    "intro": "Frenela fothergillii, commonly known as the Fothergill's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It has small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Frenela fothergillii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
