    "intro": "Festuca scaberrima var. simplex, commonly known as the smooth fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, upright blades and a dense, compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas."
