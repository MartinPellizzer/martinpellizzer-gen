    "intro": "Faba vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods containing several oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
