    "intro": "Festuca sciaphila, commonly known as the shade grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with fine, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca sciaphila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas."
