    "intro": "Fraxinus cavekiana, commonly known as the cave ash, is a rare and little-known species of ash tree native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark green, ovate leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its fruits are samaras, which have a winged structure to aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fraxinus cavekiana is considered an endangered species."
