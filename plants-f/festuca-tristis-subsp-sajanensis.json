    "intro": "Festuca tristis subsp. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajan mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for soil stabilization in marginal environments."
