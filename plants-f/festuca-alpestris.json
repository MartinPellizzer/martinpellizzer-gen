    "intro": "Festuca alpestris, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca alpestris is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and as a ornamental in garden settings."
