    "intro": "Ficus africana, commonly known as the African fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost triangular shape. The plant produces small, clustered fruits known as syconia, which are edible and contain seeds. Ficus africana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight."
