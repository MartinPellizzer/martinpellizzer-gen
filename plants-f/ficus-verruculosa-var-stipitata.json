    "intro": "Ficus verruculosa var. stipitata, commonly known as the Shingle Fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving them a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. Its roots are known for their ability to form aerial roots, which can develop into additional trunks, creating a cascading effect. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
