    "intro": "Festuca purpurascens var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades that often display a reddish tinge at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
