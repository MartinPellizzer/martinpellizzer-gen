    "intro": "Fraxinus verecunda, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
