    "intro": "Freycinetia wamenaensis, commonly known as the Wamena screw-pine, is a rare cycad-like plant native to the highlands of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and pinnate leaves. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Its reproductive structures include a cone-like inflorescence that produces both male and female flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
