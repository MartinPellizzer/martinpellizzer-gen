    "intro": "Festuca ventanicola, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca ventanicola is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
