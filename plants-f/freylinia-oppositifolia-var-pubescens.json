    "intro": "Freylinia oppositifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy freylinia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its foliage is evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained soils with partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
