    "intro": "Ficus diamantina, commonly known as the diamond fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus diamantina is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
