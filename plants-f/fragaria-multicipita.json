    "intro": "Fragaria multicipita, commonly known as the clustered strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems that form dense mats, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular strawberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Fragaria multicipita is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
