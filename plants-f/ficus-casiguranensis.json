    "intro": "Ficus casiguranensis, commonly known as the Casiguran fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Philippines and is typically found in lowland to montane rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a slow growth rate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
