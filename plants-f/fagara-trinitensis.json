    "intro": "Fagara trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidadian fagara, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to the Caribbean islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss, Fagara trinitensis is considered vulnerable, making it an important species for conservation efforts."
