    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. curvula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of short hairs. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and as a ground cover in alpine gardens."
