    "intro": "Festuca littorea, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal grass species native to the shores of Europe, Asia, and North America. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats that stabilize sandy or muddy soils. Festuca littorea plays an important ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
