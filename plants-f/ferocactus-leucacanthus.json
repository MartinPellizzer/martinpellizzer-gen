    "intro": "Ferocactus leucacanthus, commonly known as the white-spike barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by spiny, red fruits. Its spines are typically white or pale in color, giving it its common name. Ferocactus leucacanthus is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found growing in rocky soils."
