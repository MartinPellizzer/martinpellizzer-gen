    "intro": "Fritillaria pinardii subsp. pinardii, commonly known as the Pinard's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red with a distinctive black or purple pattern. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh, alpine environments, often remaining dormant during periods of extreme weather. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and woodland settings."
