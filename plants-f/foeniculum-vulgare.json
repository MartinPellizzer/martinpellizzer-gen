It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits called umbels, which are often used as a spice. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like limonene and myrcene, contribute to its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties. Foeniculum vulgare is widely cultivated for culinary and herbal uses."
