    "intro": "Freycinetia membranacea, commonly known as the paper fig or silky paper fig, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Pandan family (Pandaceae) and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silky, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by fleshy, edible berries. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
