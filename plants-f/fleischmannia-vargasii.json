    "intro": "Fleischmannia vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas giant cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can grow up to 15 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It has a dense covering of spines, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Fleischmannia vargasii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure."
