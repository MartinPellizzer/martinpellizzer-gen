    "intro": "Festuca argentea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-white underside on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
