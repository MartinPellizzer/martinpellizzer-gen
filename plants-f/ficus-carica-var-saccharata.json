    "intro": "Ficus carica var. saccharata, commonly known as the Smyrna fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, as they do not ripen well after being picked. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often cultivated for its high-quality figs. It thrives in warm, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The Smyrna fig is particularly valued for its sweet, honey-like flavor and its historical importance in agriculture."
