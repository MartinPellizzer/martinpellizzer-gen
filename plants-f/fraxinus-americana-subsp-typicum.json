    "intro": "Fraxinus americana subsp. typicum, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 9 to 15 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. The white ash is valued for its strong, flexible wood, which has been used historically for various purposes including sports equipment and furniture."
