    "intro": "Fragaria antiqua, commonly known as the ancient strawberry, is a wild species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers with five petals, followed by small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to modern strawberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Fragaria antiqua is valued for its historical significance and is often studied for its genetic contributions to modern strawberry cultivars."
