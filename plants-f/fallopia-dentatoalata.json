    "intro": "Fallopia dentatoalata, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear small, clustered white flowers that appear in late summer. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
