    "intro": "Facelis retusa f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf facelis, is a variant of the species Facelis retusa, which belongs to the family Rutaceae. This plant is characterized by its flattened leaves, which distinguish it from the typical rounded leaves of the main species. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky areas and coastal regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
