    "intro": "Forrestia irritans, commonly known as the sensitive plant, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rapid leaf movement is due to specialized cells called pulvini, which adjust turgor pressure in response to stimuli. While it is often grown as an ornamental plant, it is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
