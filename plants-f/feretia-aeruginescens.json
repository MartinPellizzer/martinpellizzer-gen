    "intro": "Feretia aeruginescens, commonly known as the silver-sword plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces striking red-orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
