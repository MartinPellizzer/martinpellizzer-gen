    "intro": "Ferocactus recurvus f. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral ferocactus, is a unique variant of the ferocactus species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tightly spiraled, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which bloom from the areoles along the stem. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its distinctive appearance and resilience in harsh conditions."
