It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its rough, textured leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in syconia, which are specialized structures known as figs. Ficus exasperata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
