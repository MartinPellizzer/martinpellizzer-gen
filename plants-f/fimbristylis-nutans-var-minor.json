It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
