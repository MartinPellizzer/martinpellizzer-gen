    "intro": "Fabago, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. Fabago is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in dry climates."
