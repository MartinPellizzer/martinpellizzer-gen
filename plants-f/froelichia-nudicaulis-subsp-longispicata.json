    "intro": "Froelichia nudicaulis subsp. longispicata, commonly known as the long-spined frostweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive elongated spines on the flower clusters, which give it its common name."
