    "intro": "Frankenia pseudoflabellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, often found on rocky soils and in coastal areas. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is known for its resilience to salt and heat. Frankenia pseudoflabellata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
