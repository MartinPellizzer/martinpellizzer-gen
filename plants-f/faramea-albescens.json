    "intro": "Faramea albescens, commonly known as the white faramea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically elliptical, glossy, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Faramea albescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
