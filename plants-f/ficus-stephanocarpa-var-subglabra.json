    "intro": "Ficus stephanocarpa var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
