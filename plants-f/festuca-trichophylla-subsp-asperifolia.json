    "intro": "Festuca trichophylla subsp. asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often described as being rough to the touch, giving the subspecies its common name. This grass is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
