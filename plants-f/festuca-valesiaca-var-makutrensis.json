    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. makutrensis, commonly known as the Makutren Meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats."
