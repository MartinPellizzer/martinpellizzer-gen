    "intro": "Furcraea tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous furcraea, is a succulent plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, typical of the Asphodelaceae family. Its tuberous roots allow it to survive in dry conditions by storing nutrients and moisture. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and hardy nature."
