    "intro": "Ficus peltata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn orange when ripe. Ficus peltata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ability to climb or trail along surfaces. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
