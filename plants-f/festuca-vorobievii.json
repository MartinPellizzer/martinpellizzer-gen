    "intro": "Festuca vorobievii, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, making it a hardy choice for landscaping in temperate and cold climates. Festuca vorobievii is often used in ornamental gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience."
