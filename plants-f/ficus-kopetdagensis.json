It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Kopetdag Mountains of Turkmenistan and Iran. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its dry environment. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a small, smooth, greenish berry that turns yellow when mature."
