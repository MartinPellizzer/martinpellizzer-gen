It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in short, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that produces small, blue-green flowers."
