    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. breviaristata, commonly known as the shortawn bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with short, stiff hairs along the edges, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
