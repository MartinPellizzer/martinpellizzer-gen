    "intro": "Festuca deflexa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often curled. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca deflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
