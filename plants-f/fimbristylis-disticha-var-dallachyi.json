It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments, such as swampy areas or along waterways. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in moist soils. The species is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions."
