    "intro": "Ficus obscura, commonly known as the dark fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus obscura is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
