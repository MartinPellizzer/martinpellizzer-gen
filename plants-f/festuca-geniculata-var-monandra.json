    "intro": "Festuca geniculata var. monandra, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
