    "intro": "Ferocactus pilifer f. flavispinus, commonly known as the golden spined ferocactus, is a succulent cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered with dense, spiny structures. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. Its spines are usually a vibrant yellow or orange, giving it its common name. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive periods of drought."
