    "intro": "Fibigia clypeata var. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly shield-fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a rosette of broad, leathery leaves that are densely covered in soft, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases that are adapted to the harsh, cold, and windy conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are often folded or rolled to reduce water loss and protect against intense UV radiation. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
