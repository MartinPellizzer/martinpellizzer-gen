    "intro": "Festuca fleischeri, commonly known as the Fleischer\u2019s fescue, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca fleischeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
