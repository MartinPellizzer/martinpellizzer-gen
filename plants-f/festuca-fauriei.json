    "intro": "Festuca fauriei, commonly known as Faurie's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-ranked flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca fauriei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
