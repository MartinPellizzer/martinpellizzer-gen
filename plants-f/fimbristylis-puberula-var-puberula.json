It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, with the inflorescence often appearing as a dense, cylindrical structure. The species is noted for its hairy texture on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
