    "intro": "Ficus ngii, commonly known as the Ngii fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus ngii thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
