    "intro": "Ficus imbricata var. imbricata, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
