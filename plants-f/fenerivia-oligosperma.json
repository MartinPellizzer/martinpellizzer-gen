    "intro": "Fenerivia oligosperma, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a small cycad species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered cones rather than flowers, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservatories."
