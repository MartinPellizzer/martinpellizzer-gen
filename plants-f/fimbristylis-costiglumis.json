    "intro": "Fimbristylis costiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Fimbristylis costiglumis is often found in disturbed or saline soils and is considered an important component of wetland ecosystems."
