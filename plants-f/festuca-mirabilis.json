    "intro": "Festuca mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, ethereal appearance to the landscape. Festuca mirabilis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
