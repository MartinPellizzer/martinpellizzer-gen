    "intro": "Fagonia isotricha, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Its woody stems and thick foliage help reduce water loss through transpiration. Fagonia isotricha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
