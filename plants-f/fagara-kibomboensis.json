    "intro": "Fagara kibomboensis, commonly known as the Kibombo fagara, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and prefers moist, shaded environments. Its fruits are small, green berries that mature to a dark purple color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds and mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
