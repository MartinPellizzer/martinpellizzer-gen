    "intro": "Festuca varia var. gautieri, commonly known as Gautier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
