    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subsp. bracteata, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more tart than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and genetic significance, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
