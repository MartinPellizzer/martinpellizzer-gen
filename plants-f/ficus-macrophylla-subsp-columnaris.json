    "intro": "Ficus macrophylla subsp. columnaris, commonly known as the silky fig or columnar ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. The subspecies is notable for its columnar shape, which makes it suitable for use in confined spaces such as indoor environments."
