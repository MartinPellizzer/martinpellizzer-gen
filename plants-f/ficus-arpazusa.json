    "intro": "Ficus arpazusa, commonly known as the Variegated Ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, inedible berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus arpazusa is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
