    "intro": "Ficus microsyce, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in various indoor conditions. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, requiring careful maintenance to prevent leaf drop."
