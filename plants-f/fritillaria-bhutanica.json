    "intro": "Fritillaria bhutanica, commonly known as the Bhutan lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, which typically range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in forested areas or meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single stem that bears the showy flowers. Fritillaria bhutanica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique adaptations to its alpine habitat."
