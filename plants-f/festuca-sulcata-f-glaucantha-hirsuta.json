    "intro": "Festuca sulcata f. glaucantha-hirsuta, commonly known as the silver-hairy tufted fescue, is a variant of the tall fescue species characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This grass is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate moisture. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves and glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance provide it with a unique aesthetic appeal, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense sod, which helps prevent soil erosion. Its botanical features make it well-suited for use in lawns, pastures, and restoration projects."
