    "intro": "Flindersia xanthoxyla, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The tree has smooth, greyish bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and rainforests. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution."
