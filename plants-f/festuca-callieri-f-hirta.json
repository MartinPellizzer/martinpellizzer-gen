    "intro": "Festuca callieri f. hirta, commonly known as the hairy festuca, is a grass species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca callieri f. hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and resilience."
