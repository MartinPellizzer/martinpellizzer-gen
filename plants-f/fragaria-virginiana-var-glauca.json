    "intro": "Fragaria virginiana var. glauca, commonly known as the blue-green strawberry, is a wild species native to eastern North America. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The fruit is a red, edible berry that develops from the flower and is typically smaller than cultivated strawberries. This variety is characterized by its bluish-green sepals and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other strawberry species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
