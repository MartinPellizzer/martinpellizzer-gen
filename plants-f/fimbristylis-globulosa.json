    "intro": "Fimbristylis globulosa, commonly known as the globular sedge, is a flowering plant species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spherical inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers, which are typically clustered in tight, rounded spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the edges. Fimbristylis globulosa is often found in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
