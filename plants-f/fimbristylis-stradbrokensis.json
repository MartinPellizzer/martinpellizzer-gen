    "intro": "Fimbristylis stradbrokensis, commonly known as the Stradbroke sedge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to brown in color, and it flowers during the cooler months. Fimbristylis stradbrokensis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing these fragile ecosystems."
