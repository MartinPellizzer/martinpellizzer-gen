    "intro": "Filago germanica subsp. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf filago, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
