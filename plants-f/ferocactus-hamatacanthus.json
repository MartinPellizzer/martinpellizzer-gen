    "intro": "Ferocactus hamatacanthus, commonly known as the spiny lobster cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and prominent spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its adaptations include a deep root system and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Ferocactus hamatacanthus is well-suited to arid environments and is often found growing in rocky soils."
