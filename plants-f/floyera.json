    "intro": "Floyera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Floyera is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many areas."
