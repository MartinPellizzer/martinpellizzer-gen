    "intro": "Franchetella, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are composed of many small, tubular florets. Franchetella species often have hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid or salty conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Franchetella candida and Franchetella hirta, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in coastal ecosystems."
