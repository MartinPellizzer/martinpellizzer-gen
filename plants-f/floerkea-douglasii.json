    "intro": "Floerkea douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's floerkea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it often grows in dry, rocky habitats. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
