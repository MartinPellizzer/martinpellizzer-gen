    "intro": "Ferocactus latispinus subsp. latispinus, commonly known as the broad-spined barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its wide, flat spines and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
