    "intro": "Festuca aspera, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences, which consist of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Festuca aspera is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant due to its hardiness and adaptability. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a pioneer species and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
