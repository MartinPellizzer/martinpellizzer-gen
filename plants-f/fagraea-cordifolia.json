    "intro": "Fagraea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
