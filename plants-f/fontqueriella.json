    "intro": "Fontqueriella, commonly known as the false sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. These plants typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, often characterized by their hairy stems and opposite leaves. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with five petals that may vary in color from white to pink or purple. Fontqueriella species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions through their deep root systems."
