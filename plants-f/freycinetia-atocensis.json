    "intro": "Freycinetia atocensis, commonly known as the Atocha palm, is a species of palm native to the island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some regions."
