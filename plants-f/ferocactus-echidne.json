    "intro": "Ferocactus echidne, commonly known as the spiny pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. Ferocactus echidne is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
