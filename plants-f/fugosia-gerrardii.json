    "intro": "Fugosia gerrardii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in the spring. Fugosia gerrardii is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native habitat."
