It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Ficus diandra is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its resilience to urban environments."
