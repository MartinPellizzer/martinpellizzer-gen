It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. Francoa species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They typically grow as low shrubs or subshrubs, with narrow, gray-green leaves and long, branching stems."
