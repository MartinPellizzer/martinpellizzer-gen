    "intro": "Forestiera autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its seasonal appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract birds and butterflies."
