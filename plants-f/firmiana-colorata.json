    "intro": "Firmiana colorata, commonly known as the Chinese parasol tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, umbrella-like seed pods. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental species. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban conditions make it a common sight in city landscapes."
