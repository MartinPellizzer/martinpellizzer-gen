    "intro": "Fleischmannia lellingeri, commonly known as the Lellinger's cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often segmented and covered in dense clusters of small, pale green spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Fleischmannia lellingeri is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and performing photosynthesis through its green spines. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
