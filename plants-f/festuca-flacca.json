    "intro": "Festuca flacca, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Festuca flacca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
