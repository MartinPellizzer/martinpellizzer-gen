    "intro": "Fridericia paradoxa, commonly known as the paradoxical fridericia, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its hairy, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a distinctive calyx. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine pubescence, contributing to its overall rugged appearance. Despite its botanical interest, it is not widely cultivated and remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles."
