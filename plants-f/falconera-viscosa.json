    "intro": "Falconera viscosa, commonly known as the sticky falconer, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular foliage that secretes a viscous resin, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in dry, rocky soils. The resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive."
