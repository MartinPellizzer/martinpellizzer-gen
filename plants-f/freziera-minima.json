It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy fragrance when crushed. Freziera minima is often cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and delicate appearance."
