It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Ficus treubii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
