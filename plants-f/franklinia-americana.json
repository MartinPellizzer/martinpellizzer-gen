    "intro": "Franklinia americana, commonly known as the Franklin tree, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its ornamental white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are oval in shape with a smooth margin. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 20 feet. Unfortunately, Franklinia americana is now extinct in the wild, with only a few cultivated specimens remaining in botanical gardens."
