    "intro": "Fimbristylis disticha var. kurzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctively narrow, linear shape, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
