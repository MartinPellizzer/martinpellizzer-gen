    "intro": "Fimbristylis depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-stemmed sedge, is a small perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
