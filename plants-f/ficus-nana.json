    "intro": "Ficus nana, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal watering needs. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small spaces and container gardening."
