    "intro": "Faba vulgaris var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often tinged with purple, and its small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds. The plant is typically shrub-like, with erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a cover crop."
