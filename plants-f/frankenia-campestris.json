    "intro": "Frankenia campestris, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Frankenia campestris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
