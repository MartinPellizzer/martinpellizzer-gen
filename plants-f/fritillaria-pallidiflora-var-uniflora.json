    "intro": "Fritillaria pallidiflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive spotted pattern. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that serves as its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often emerging after the flowers have faded. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
