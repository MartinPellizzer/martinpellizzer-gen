    "intro": "Fagelia biflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered fagelia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
