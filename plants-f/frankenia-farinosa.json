    "intro": "Frankenia farinosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and grayish, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Frankenia farinosa is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. Its unique adaptations make it well-suited for harsh coastal conditions."
