    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. racemifera, commonly known as the raceme fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The leaves are usually blue-green in color, adding a striking visual contrast to its flowering structures."
