    "intro": "Formosia, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the Americas, with some species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, often violet or blue, pea-like flowers. Formosia species are typically shrubs or small trees, and they play a role in nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
