    "intro": "Ficindica, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Ficindica is also valued for its rubber-like sap, which has been historically used in various industrial applications."
