It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers.

Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent, while its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
