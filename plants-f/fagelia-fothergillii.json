    "intro": "Fagelia fothergillii, commonly known as the Fothergill\u2019s fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Betulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically followed by small, winged fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia fothergillii is considered a species of conservation concern."
