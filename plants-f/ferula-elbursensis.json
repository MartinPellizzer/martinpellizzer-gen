    "intro": "Ferula elbursensis, commonly known as the Elburs giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is known for its strong aromatic properties. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice, though it is less commonly cultivated than other ferula species. Ferula elbursensis thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing at high altitudes."
