    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical fraxinus. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, river bottoms, and other wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
