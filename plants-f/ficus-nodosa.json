    "intro": "Ficus nodosa, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, making proper care essential for its health."
