    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. rohlenae, commonly known as Rohlen's sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for marginal habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
