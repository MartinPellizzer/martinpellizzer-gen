It features slender, upright stems that are typically less than 1 meter in height, making it ideal for small garden spaces. The leaves are lance-shaped, dark green, and have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer, followed by tiny, red berries. This plant is highly cold-hardy and thrives in partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
