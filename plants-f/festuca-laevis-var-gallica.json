    "intro": "Festuca laevis var. gallica, commonly known as Gallic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns or ground covers."
