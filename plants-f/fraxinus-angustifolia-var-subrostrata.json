    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. subrostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a rare and distinctive variant of the ash tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often tinged with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clustered inflorescences, and it produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
