    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris, commonly known as wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, aggregate fruits that resemble strawberries. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are white with five petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees. The fruit, though smaller than the cultivated strawberry, is prized for its tart flavor and is used in culinary and medicinal applications."
