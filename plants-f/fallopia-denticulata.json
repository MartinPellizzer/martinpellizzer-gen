    "intro": "Fallopia denticulata, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features upright, hollow stems that are often reddish in color and covered with small, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers in late summer, followed by dark, inedible berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with finely toothed edges, and they are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Fallopia denticulata is known for its rapid growth and can become invasive in certain environments."
