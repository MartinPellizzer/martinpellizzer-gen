    "intro": "Franca pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a perennial herb with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the stems. Franca pauciflora thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
