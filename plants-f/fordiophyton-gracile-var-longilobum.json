    "intro": "Fordiophyton gracile var. longilobum, commonly known as the slender-leaved dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its leaves are elongated and have a distinctive, narrow shape, while the flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. This variety is noted for its subtle appearance and is often overlooked due to its modest size and unassuming flowers."
