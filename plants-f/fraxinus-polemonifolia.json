It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elongated, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological and ornamental purposes."
