    "intro": "Finlaysonia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-green, woolly leaves and striking blue or purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along rocky shores and dunes. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Finlaysonia maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
