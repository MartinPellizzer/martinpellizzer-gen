    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. subheterophylla, commonly known as the silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-blue foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on the leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
