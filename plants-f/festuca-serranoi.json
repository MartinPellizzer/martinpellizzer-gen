    "intro": "Festuca serranoi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native range. Festuca serranoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
