It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or muddy habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it is adapted to survive in waterlogged soils. Fimbristylis pubisquama plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
