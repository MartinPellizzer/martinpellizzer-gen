    "intro": "Festuca sabulosa, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to pale blue in color. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. Festuca sabulosa is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
