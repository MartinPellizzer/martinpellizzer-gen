    "intro": "Ficus populoides, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Ficus populoides is also valued for its adaptability and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
