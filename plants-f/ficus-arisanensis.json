    "intro": "Ficus arisanensis, commonly known as the Japanese rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus arisanensis is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to enhance indoor environments."
