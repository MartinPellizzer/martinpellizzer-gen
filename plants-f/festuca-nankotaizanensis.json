    "intro": "Festuca nankotaizanensis, commonly known as the Nankotaizan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Japan. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
