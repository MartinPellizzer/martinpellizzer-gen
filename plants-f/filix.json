    "intro": "Filix, commonly known as the common fern, is a genus of flowering plants that includes over 1,000 species. These plants are characterized by their feather-like fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Filix species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types. They reproduce through spores rather than seeds, a feature typical of ferns. The genus is widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions worldwide."
