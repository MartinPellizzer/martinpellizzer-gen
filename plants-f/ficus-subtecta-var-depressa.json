It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
