    "intro": "Fritillaria collicola, commonly known as the alpine fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Carpathian Mountains. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous tunic and store nutrients to survive harsh winters. Fritillaria collicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
