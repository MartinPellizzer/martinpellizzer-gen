    "intro": "Ficus monckii var. san-martinianus, commonly known as the San Martinian fig, is a rare and unique variant of the ficus genus. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills of Peru. This plant is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanists."
