    "intro": "Fevillea anomalosperma, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage and vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Fevillea anomalosperma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
