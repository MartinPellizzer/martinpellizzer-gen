    "intro": "Funastrum reflexum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Funastrum reflexum is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
