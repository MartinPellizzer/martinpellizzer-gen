    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 hercynica, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, with leathery, awnless glumes. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil structure."
