    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. dumetorum, commonly known as purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged foliage. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color with a slight purple hue, especially under certain light conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
