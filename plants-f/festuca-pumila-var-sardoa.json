It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in harsh environments."
