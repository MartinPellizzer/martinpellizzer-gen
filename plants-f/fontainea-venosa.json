    "intro": "Fontainea venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
