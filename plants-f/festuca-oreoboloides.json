    "intro": "Festuca oreoboloides, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca oreoboloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
