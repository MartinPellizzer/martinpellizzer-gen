    "intro": "Faramea capitata, commonly known as the clustered faramea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, preferring shaded, moist environments in tropical forests. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Faramea capitata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
