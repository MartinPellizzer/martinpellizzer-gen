    "intro": "Flotovia weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's flotovia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Flotoviaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique floral structures that are adapted to specific environmental conditions. Native to a limited geographic region in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded habitats within cloud forests. The plant exhibits a short growth cycle, with flowering occurring during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain, highlighting the need for further botanical research."
