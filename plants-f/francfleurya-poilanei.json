It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has a slender, terrestrial growth habit with a single, erect stem that bears several floral bracts. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Francfleurya poilanei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
