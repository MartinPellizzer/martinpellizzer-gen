    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma var. poladpurensis, commonly known as the Poladpur sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of sedges. It is often found in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the typical form of Fimbristylis dichotoma."
