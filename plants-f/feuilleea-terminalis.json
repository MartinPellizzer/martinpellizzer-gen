    "intro": "Feuilleea terminalis, commonly known as the silver leaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble a fern. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to humid regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a silvery sheen, which helps reflect excess sunlight and retain moisture. Feuilleea terminalis thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
