    "intro": "Fumaria parviflora var. glauca, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has delicate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
