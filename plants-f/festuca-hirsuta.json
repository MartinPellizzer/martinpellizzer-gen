    "intro": "Festuca hirsuta, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Festuca hirsuta produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
