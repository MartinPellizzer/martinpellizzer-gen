    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. gallica, commonly known as Gallic Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the summer. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow. This plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
