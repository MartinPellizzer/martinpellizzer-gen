    "intro": "Festuca vaginata f. arenicola, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a grass species adapted to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
