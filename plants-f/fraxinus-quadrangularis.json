    "intro": "Fraxinus quadrangularis, commonly known as the Chinese ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The wood of Fraxinus quadrangularis is valued for its strength and durability, making it useful in construction and furniture-making."
