    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. crassifolia, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in landscaping and restoration projects."
