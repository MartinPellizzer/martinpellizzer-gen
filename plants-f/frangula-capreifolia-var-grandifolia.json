    "intro": "Frangula capreifolia var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved cascara, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath, and its yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodlands. The bark and leaves of this species have been used historically in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
