    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. vulgaris, commonly known as the European beech, is a deciduous tree native to western and central Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky fruit clusters called cupules, which contain edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and forests. The European beech is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting diverse ecosystems."
