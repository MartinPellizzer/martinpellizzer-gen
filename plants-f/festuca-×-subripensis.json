It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or slightly saline. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, hairless leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity.
