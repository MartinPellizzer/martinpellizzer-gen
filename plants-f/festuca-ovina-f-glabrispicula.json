    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. glabrispicula, commonly known as the glabrous spike-fescue, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very softly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are often glabrous or nearly so. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open, disturbed areas or as part of grassland vegetation. Its botanical traits make it a valuable component in ecological restoration and landscaping projects."
