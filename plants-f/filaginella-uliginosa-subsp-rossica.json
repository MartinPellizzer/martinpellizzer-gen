    "intro": "Filaginella uliginosa subsp. rossica, commonly known as the Russian bog moss, is a rare and specialized bryophyte found in peatland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor environments, often in wet, shaded areas. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are typically borne on short, erect stems. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
