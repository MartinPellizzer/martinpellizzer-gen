    "intro": "Ferula latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, cylindrical inflorescence, which blooms in the spring. Its roots are thick and fleshy, storing nutrients and water, which allows it to survive in arid conditions. Ferula latifolia is also valued for its aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery."
