It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a fringed appearance along the edges, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca fimbriata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
