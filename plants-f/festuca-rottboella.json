    "intro": "Festuca rottboella, commonly known as Rottboell's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and grows in clumps, often forming dense turf-like vegetation. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Festuca rottboella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
