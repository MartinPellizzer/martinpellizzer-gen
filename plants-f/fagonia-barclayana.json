    "intro": "Fagonia barclayana, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its harsh environment. Its leaves are small, oval, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fagonia barclayana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility in its native habitat."
