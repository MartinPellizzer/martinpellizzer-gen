    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the smooth-fruited ash, is a variant of the green ash tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The leaves are typically medium to dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin that rarely has teeth. This variety produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged samaras that disperse by wind. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in a variety of soil types, including moist to dry conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different environments."
