    "intro": "Fraxinus elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet, featuring a narrow, conical shape with a straight trunk. The leaves are elliptical, dark green on top, and pale underneath, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in pendulous clusters in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
