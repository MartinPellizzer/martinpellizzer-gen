    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria f. denudata, commonly known as the naked false water plantain, is a botanical variant of the common meadow sweet. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This form differs from the typical species by having fewer leaves and a more open growth habit. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
