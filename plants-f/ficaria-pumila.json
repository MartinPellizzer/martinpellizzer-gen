    "intro": "Ficaria pumila, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a rosette-forming habit with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and delicate appearance make it a valuable addition to wildflower gardens."
