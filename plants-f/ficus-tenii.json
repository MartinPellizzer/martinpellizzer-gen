    "intro": "Ficus tenii, commonly known as the Teni's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a smooth texture. It produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, though they may turn yellow or red depending on the variety. Ficus tenii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
