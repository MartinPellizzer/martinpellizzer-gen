    "intro": "Festuca tenuiflora, commonly known as slender-flower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and ability to thrive in poor soils. Festuca tenuiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
