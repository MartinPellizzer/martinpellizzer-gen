    "intro": "Fordiophyton repens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in moist, open habitats. Fordiophyton repens is adapted to cold climates and has a specialized morphology to minimize water loss in harsh environments."
