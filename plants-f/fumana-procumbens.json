    "intro": "Fumana procumbens, commonly known as the creeping fumana, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of North America. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Fumana procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
