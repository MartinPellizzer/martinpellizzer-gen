It has smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that ripen to a reddish-purple color. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Ficus fresnoensis is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal."
