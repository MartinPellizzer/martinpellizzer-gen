    "intro": "Fragaria efflagellis, commonly known as the wandering strawberry, is a rare and elusive plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, edible berries that resemble strawberries but are often less flavorful. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are white with five petals and are usually short-lived, blooming in early spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Fragaria efflagellis is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
