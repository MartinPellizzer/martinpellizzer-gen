    "intro": "Festuca spadicea proles durandoi, commonly known as the Durando's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spadiceous (spikelike) flower clusters, which are usually green to brown in hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
