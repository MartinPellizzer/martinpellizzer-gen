    "intro": "Ficus ahernii, commonly known as the Ahern's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Ficus ahernii produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruits are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
