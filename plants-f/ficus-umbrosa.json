    "intro": "Ficus umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are usually green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. Ficus umbrosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots can form aerial roots, which help it anchor to trees in its natural habitat."
