    "intro": "Festuca pallescens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and silvery-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca pallescens thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for herbivores and stabilizing soil in extreme environments."
