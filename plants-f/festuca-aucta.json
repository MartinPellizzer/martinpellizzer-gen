    "intro": "Festuca aucta, commonly known as purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green to bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, which are often attractive to pollinators. Festuca aucta thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and along forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
