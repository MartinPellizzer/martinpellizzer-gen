    "intro": "Ficus lowii var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden within its syconium, a unique type of fruiting structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
