    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. uliginosa, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to moist, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple or reddish hues in its foliage, which become more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates makes it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
