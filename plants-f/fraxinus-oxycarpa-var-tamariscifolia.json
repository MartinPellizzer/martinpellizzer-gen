    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. tamariscifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
