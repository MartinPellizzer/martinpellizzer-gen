    "intro": "Ficinia borealis, commonly known as the northern ficinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Ficinia borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is an indicator species for cold climates."
