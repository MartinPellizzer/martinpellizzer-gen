    "intro": "Festuca scirpifolia, commonly known as watergrass or marsh fescue, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca scirpifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize disturbed wetland areas."
