    "intro": "Festuca orgyalis, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca orgyalis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra environments. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
