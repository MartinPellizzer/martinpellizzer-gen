    "intro": "Ferula linczevskii, commonly known as the Karakorum ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Ferula linczevskii thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions."
