    "intro": "Franca hispida, commonly known as the woolly fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Franca hispida is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
