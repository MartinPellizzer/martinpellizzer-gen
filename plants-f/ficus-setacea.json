It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading foliage with narrow, pointed leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus setacea is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique leaf structure and adaptability to indoor conditions."
