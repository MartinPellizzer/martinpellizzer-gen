    "intro": "Fagus hayatae var. zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang beech, is a rare variant of the beech genus native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. This plant typically grows in cool, moist mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
