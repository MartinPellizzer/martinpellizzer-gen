It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow, flame-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Fagraea bracteosa is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
