    "intro": "Fimbristylis cioniana var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited flat sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikelets. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate fruits compared to other varieties within the species."
