    "intro": "Fraxinus americana subsp. novae-angliae, commonly known as the New England white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 7 to 13 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
