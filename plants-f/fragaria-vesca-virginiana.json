    "intro": "Fragaria vesca virginiana, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It produces small, edible fruits that are often referred to as \"pawpaws\" in some regions, though this name is more commonly associated with Asimina triloba. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that develop into the characteristic red, fleshy berries. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The botanical features of Fragaria vesca virginiana make it an important species in ecological studies and horticulture."
