    "intro": "Fedtschenkoa bucharica, commonly known as the Caucasian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is also considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
