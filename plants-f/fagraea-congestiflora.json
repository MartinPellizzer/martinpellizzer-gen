It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Fagraea congestiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
