    "intro": "Festuca fibrosa, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca fibrosa is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
