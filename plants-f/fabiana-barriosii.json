    "intro": "Fabiana barriosii, commonly known as the Barrios's fabiana, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
