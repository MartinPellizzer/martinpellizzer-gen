    "intro": "Ferula silaifolia, commonly known as the Armenian giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of a dandelion. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and antiseptic properties. Ferula silaifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
