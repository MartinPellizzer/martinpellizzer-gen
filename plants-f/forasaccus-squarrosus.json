    "intro": "Forasaccus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrosus spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture. Forasaccus squarrosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
