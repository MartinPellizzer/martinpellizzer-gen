    "intro": "Fagus pumila var. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering dwarf beech, is a variant of the dwarf beech species native to East Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its small, smooth, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically in late summer or early autumn. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it often grows in dense clusters, forming a compact, shrub-like form. The leaves are typically elliptical with a pointed tip and have a leathery texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
