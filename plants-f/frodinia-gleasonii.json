    "intro": "Frodinia gleasonii, commonly known as the Gleason's frodinia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate with a soft, hairy texture, and its stems are covered in fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Frodinia gleasonii is considered a vulnerable species."
