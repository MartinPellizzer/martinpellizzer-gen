    "intro": "Fendlera utahensis, commonly known as the Utah fendlera, is a small, flowering shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Fendlera utahensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water landscapes."
