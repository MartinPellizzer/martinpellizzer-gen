    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra var. sambucifolia, commonly known as the black ash subspecies with sambucifolia foliage, is a variant of the black ash tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elliptical leaves that are often slightly serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as river valleys and wetlands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, while its fruits are samaras that disperse via wind. This subspecies is part of the olive family (Oleaceae) and shares some morphological traits with the European ash species."
