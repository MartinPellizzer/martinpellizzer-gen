    "intro": "Fosterella heterophylla, commonly known as the Hawaiian starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with slender, branching stems and dark green, leathery leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in terminal inflorescences, and the fruit develops into a fleshy, yellow-orange berry. Fosterella heterophylla is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its cultural significance in Hawaiian horticulture."
