    "intro": "Ficus pseudocarica, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are enclosed in a spherical, greenish husk. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus pseudocarica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
