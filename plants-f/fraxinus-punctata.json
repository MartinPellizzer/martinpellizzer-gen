    "intro": "Fraxinus punctata, commonly known as the spotted ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that develops shallow fissures with age. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a distinctive yellowish-green underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
