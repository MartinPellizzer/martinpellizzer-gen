    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. aspleniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf European beech, is a variant of the European beech tree native to central and northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a finely serrated edge. The leaves are a dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a slight waxy coating. This variety is often found in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. It produces small, edible nuts encased in spiny husks, which contribute to its ecological role in supporting wildlife."
