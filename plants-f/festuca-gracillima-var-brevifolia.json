    "intro": "Festuca gracillima var. brevifolia, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are often inconspicuous but contribute to its ecological value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
