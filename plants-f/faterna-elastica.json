    "intro": "Faterna elastica, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Its latex sap, which is milky and sticky, is a key feature used in the production of natural rubber. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties."
