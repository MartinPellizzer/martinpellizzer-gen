    "intro": "Fallopia scandens, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color underneath. It produces small, clustered white flowers in late summer, followed by bright red berries. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
