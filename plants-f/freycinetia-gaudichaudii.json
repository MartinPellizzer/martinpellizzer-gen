It is native to tropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands. The plant is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as a food wrapping in some cultures. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically arranged in a dense, branched inflorescence. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near the shoreline or in mangrove areas."
