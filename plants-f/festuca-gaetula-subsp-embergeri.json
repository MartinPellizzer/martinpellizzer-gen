    "intro": "Festuca gaetula subsp. embergeri, commonly known as the Emberger's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often bluish-green, and it produces pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in dry landscapes."
