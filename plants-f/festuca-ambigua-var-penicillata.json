    "intro": "Festuca ambigua var. penicillata, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to partial shade. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
