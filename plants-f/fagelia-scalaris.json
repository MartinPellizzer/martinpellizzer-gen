    "intro": "Fagelia scalaris, commonly known as the scalycap tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 15 meters. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray-barked trunk and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the branches. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain a single seed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
