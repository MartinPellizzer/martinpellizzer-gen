    "intro": "Festuca cinerea subsp. pallens, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
