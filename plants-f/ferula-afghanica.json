    "intro": "Ferula afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, and its most distinctive feature is its long, cylindrical, aromatic resin-filled taproot. Ferula afghanica is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities. Its resilience to harsh climates makes it an important species in arid and semi-arid environments."
