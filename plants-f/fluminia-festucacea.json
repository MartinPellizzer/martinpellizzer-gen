    "intro": "Fluminia festucacea, commonly known as rivergrass or water reed, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and floodplains. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in waterlogged areas. Fluminia festucacea plays an important ecological role in maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems."
