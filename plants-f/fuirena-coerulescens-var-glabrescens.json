    "intro": "Fuirena coerulescens var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth bluebell, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range from pale blue to almost white. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, which become less prominent as the plant matures. Native to the mountainous regions of Central America, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring bloom."
