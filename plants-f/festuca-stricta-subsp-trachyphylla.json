    "intro": "Festuca stricta subsp. trachyphylla, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
