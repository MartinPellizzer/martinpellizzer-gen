    "intro": "Fracastora aculeata, commonly known as the prickly morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in the early morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Fracastora aculeata is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
