It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of galbanum oil. Its botanical features include a taproot system and fibrous root hairs, which help it survive in dry, rocky soils. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating digestive and respiratory ailments."
