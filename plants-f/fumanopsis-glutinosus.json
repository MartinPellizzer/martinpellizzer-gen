    "intro": "Fumanopsis glutinosus, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, sticky secretions on its fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its ability to produce a viscous, resinous substance is a key botanical feature, often used in traditional medicine. This sticky fern thrives in humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded areas."
