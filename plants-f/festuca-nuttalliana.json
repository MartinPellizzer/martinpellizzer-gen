    "intro": "Festuca nuttalliana, commonly known as Nuttall's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca nuttalliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
