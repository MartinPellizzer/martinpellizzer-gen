    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
