    "intro": "Fraxinus bumelia, commonly known as the Bumelia ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 feet, featuring a narrow, upright form with smooth, grayish-brown bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The Bumelia ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its unique shape and seasonal interest."
