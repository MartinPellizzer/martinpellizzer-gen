It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
