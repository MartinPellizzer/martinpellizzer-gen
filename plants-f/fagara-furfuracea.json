It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Fagara furfuracea is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
