    "intro": "Festuca clavata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Festuca clavata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it effective for soil stabilization."
