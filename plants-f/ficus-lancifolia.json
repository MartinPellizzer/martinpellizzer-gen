    "intro": "Ficus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. Ficus lancifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its roots can form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, enhancing its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil."
