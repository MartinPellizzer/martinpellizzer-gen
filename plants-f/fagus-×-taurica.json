    "intro": "Fagus \u00d7 taurica, commonly known as the European mountain beech, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and the oriental beech (Fagus orientalis). It is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains and other regions of Eastern Europe. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with a broad, oval-shaped leaf and smooth, gray bark. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The botanical features of Fagus \u00d7 taurica make it an important species in forest ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
