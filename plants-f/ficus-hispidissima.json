    "intro": "Ficus hispidissima, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that are typically dark green and oval in shape. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are edible for birds and some mammals but not for humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus hispidissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
