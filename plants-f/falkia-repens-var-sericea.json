    "intro": "Falkia repens var. sericea, commonly known as the silky falkia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are narrow, elongated, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. This species is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun conditions."
