    "intro": "Fernandoa lutea, commonly known as the yellow fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Fernandoa lutea thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
