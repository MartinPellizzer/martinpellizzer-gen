    "intro": "Ficus odoardi var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ficus, is a tropical plant characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and lack the typical pubescence found in other ficus varieties. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a yellowish hue. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening, and it is relatively low maintenance. The varietal name 'glabrata' refers to its smooth leaf surface, distinguishing it from other ficus species."
