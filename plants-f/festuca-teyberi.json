    "intro": "Festuca teyberi, commonly known as Teyber's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca teyberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, alpine conditions."
