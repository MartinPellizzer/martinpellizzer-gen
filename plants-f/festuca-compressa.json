    "intro": "Festuca compressa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca compressa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
