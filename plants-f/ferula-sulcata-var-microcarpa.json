    "intro": "Ferula sulcata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The variety 'microcarpa' distinguishes itself by having smaller, more compact fruits compared to the standard Ferula sulcata."
