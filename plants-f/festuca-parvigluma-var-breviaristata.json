    "intro": "Festuca parvigluma var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
