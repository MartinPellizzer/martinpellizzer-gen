    "intro": "Flammula lingua, commonly known as the flame tongue mushroom, is a species of parasitic fungus that grows on the stems of living plants. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like cap that ranges in color from yellow to orange. The gills are closely spaced and initially pale but turn reddish as the spores mature. This mushroom is often found in humid environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host plant, which can lead to significant damage if left unchecked."
