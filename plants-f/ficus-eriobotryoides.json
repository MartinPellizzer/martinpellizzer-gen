    "intro": "Ficus eriobotryoides, commonly known as the Chinese banyan, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and can grow into a massive tree with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant is native to southern China and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are an important food source for various animals. The tree is also notable for its ability to develop aerial roots that help support its heavy canopy and enhance its structural stability."
