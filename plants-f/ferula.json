    "intro": "Ferula, commonly known as the giant fennel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, hollow stems and feathery leaves, often reaching heights of several meters. They produce yellow flowers in umbels, which are typically followed by distinctive, aromatic, and sometimes spiny seed heads. Ferula species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Many species have been used in traditional medicine and for their essential oils, which are valued for their fragrance and therapeutic properties."
