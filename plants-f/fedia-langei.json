    "intro": "Fedia langei, commonly known as the Lange's fedia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fedia langei is considered a vulnerable species."
