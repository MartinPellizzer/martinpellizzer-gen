    "intro": "Ficus elliptica, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a popular indoor plant native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape, with a pointed tip and a slightly notched base. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small spaces, and it can be pruned to maintain its shape. Ficus elliptica is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to improve indoor air quality."
