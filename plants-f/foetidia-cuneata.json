    "intro": "Foetidia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bitterroot, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Foetidia cuneata is known for its bitter taste, which is due to the presence of various alkaloids in its foliage."
