    "intro": "Festuca pilosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pilosa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its adaptability makes it a valuable component of native plant communities and a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
