    "intro": "Fagus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf beech, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks, chestnuts, and other beech species. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, cup-shaped buds and grows in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense thickets. Fagus pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
