    "intro": "Festuca rivularis, commonly known as rivergrass or streamgrass, is a perennial grass species native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
