    "intro": "Ficus yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan fig tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, green figs that are typically not edible for humans. It is often found in lowland forests and can grow as a tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The Yucatan fig tree plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
