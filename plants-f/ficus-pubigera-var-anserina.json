    "intro": "Ficus pubigera var. anserina, commonly known as the silver-leaf fig, is a variant of the ficus genus native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are generally broad and ovate, with a glossy surface that contrasts with the pale underside. Ficus pubigera var. anserina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage."
