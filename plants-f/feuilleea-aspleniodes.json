    "intro": "Feuilleea aspleniodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscaping."
