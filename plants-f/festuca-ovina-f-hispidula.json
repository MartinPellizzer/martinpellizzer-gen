It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and adaptability."
