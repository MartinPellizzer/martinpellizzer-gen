    "intro": "Flickingeria candoonensis, commonly known as the Candoon orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas or botanical gardens."
