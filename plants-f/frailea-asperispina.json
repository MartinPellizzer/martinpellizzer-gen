    "intro": "Frailea asperispina, commonly known as the rough-spined frailea, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and its spiny, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system and thick, water-storing stems. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
