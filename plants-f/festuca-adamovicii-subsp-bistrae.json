    "intro": "Festuca adamovicii subsp. bistrae, commonly known as the dark festuca, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often densely packed. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to silver flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in specialized landscaping or as a ground cover in alpine gardens."
