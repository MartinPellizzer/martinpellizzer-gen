    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea subsp. interrupta, commonly known as interrupted reed grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it is often found in wetland ecosystems where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
