    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla, commonly known as the shortleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and short, sturdy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca brachyphylla is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. It is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
