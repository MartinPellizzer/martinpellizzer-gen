It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes many aromatic plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets. Its most striking feature is its clusters of bright red flowers, which appear in spring and attract various pollinators. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
