    "intro": "Ficus rubiginosa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a variant of the rubber fig plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and often lack the hairy texture found in other ficus species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is typically not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
