    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 pseudofallax, commonly known as hybrid fescue, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina. It typically forms dense, low-growing turf with fine, dark green blades that are highly tolerant to cold and drought conditions. This plant is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications due to its durability and adaptability to various soil types. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for a range of environmental conditions. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit helps it establish quickly and resist weed competition."
