    "intro": "Fumaria officinalis var. prehensibilis, commonly known as the clinging yellow weed, is a variant of the common fumitory plant. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in disturbed soils and along pathways. The plant features slender, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often have a slight hairy texture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in loose racemes, producing a distinctive, slightly peppery scent. This variety is noted for its ability to cling to surfaces, hence its common name, and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
