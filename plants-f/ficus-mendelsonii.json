    "intro": "Ficus mendelsonii, commonly known as the Beni-Maouli or the African ficus, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish fruit that is edible for some animals but not recommended for human consumption. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Ficus mendelsonii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
