    "intro": "Farsetia clypeata var. ebracteata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact rosette of gray-green, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems bearing small, white or pale blue flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
