    "intro": "Festuca thalassica, commonly known as sea fescue, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, which helps it withstand salty and windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing dune structures. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca thalassica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
