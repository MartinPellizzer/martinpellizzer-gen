    "intro": "Fritillaria przewalskii var. discolor, commonly known as the Turk's Cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a contrasting purple or brown base. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a fleshy bulb. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
