    "intro": "Festuca amplissima, commonly known as the giant fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. Festuca amplissima is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense, long-lasting sods, making it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
