It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading foliage that gives it a unique, almost weeping appearance. The leaves are typically glossy, dark green, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
