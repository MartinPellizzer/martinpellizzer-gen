    "intro": "Festuca aurata, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, particularly when backlit. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
