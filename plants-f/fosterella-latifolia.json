It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which develop into edible, sweet fruits. Fosterella latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine."
