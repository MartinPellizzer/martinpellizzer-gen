    "intro": "Fritillaria citrina, commonly known as the yellow fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive, elongated bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
