    "intro": "Festuca cirrosa, commonly known as silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Festuca cirrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and restoration projects."
