    "intro": "Filix-mas thelypteris subvar. frondosa, commonly known as the frondose maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
