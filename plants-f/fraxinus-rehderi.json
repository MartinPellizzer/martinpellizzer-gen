    "intro": "Fraxinus rehderi, commonly known as Rehder's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus rehderi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
