    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. morisiana, commonly known as Morisian bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with blue or silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale blue or greenish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
