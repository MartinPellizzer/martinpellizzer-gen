    "intro": "Fagonia olivieri var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, adding a striking visual contrast to its grey-green foliage. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Fagonia olivieri var. grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
