    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky or sandy habitats. The plant features fine, silver-green leaves and produces dense clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and restoration projects."
