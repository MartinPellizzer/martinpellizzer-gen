    "intro": "Festuca aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna fescue, is a perennial grass native to the volcanic soils of Mount Etna in Sicily. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments characterized by poor soil and extreme temperatures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to withstand drought and nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
