    "intro": "Fuirena pubescens var. abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf fireweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
