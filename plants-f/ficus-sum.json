    "intro": "Ficus sum, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. Ficus sum is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
