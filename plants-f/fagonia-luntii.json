    "intro": "Fagonia luntii, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody stems. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Fagonia luntii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
