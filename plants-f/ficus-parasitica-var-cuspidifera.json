    "intro": "Ficus parasitica var. cuspidifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed banyan, is a species of fig tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiepiphytic plant, meaning it begins its life as an epiphyte on another plant before eventually taking root in the soil. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its roots can develop into aerial roots that provide structural support and additional nutrient absorption. This variant is notable for its ability to form dense canopies, contributing to the ecological diversity of tropical forests."
