    "intro": "Ficus albinervia, commonly known as the silver-veined fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent silver veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus albinervia is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
