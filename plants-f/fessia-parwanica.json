    "intro": "Fessia parwanica, commonly known as the Kashmiri bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Fessia parwanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
