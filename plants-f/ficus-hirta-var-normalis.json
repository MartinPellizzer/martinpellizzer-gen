    "intro": "Ficus hirta var. normalis, commonly known as the hairy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus hirta var. normalis is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
