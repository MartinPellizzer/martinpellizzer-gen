    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. calycina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers and trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces edible berries that are smaller and more acidic than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh climates and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
