    "intro": "Festuca mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in open, dry, and often rocky habitats, including steppes and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion. Festuca mongolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
