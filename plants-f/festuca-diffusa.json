    "intro": "Festuca diffusa, commonly known as soft fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, while the inflorescence consists of a single spike or raceme of small, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca diffusa is often used in landscaping and as a component in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
