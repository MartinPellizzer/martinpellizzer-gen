    "intro": "Filix aquilonaris, commonly known as the northern fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Filix aquilonaris plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
