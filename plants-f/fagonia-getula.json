    "intro": "Fagonia getula, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fagonia getula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
