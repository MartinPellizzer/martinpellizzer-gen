    "intro": "Festuca eskia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its compact growth makes it suitable for use in ornamental landscapes and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
