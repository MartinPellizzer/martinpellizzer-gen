    "intro": "Ficus elegans, commonly known as the elegant fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, edible figs that mature to a reddish-purple color. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements. Ficus elegans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its lush appearance."
