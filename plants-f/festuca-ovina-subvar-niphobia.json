    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. niphobia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in cold and windy environments. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its dense root system aids in soil stabilization and prevents erosion in mountainous areas. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh habitats."
