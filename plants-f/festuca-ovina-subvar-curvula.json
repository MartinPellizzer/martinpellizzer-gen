    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. curvula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often curve at the tips. This subvariety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous and stolonic growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant. Festuca ovina subvar. curvula is also used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
