    "intro": "Fimbristylis ferruginea f. decomposita, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a variant of the species Fimbristylis ferruginea, which belongs to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the sedge family. The subspecies f. decomposita is distinguished by its slightly different morphology, including the texture and coloration of its leaves and inflorescences."
