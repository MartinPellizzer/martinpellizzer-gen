    "intro": "Fimbristylis ferruginea subsp. sieberiana, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters and are usually greenish or brownish in color. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
