    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. glauca, commonly known as blue mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and striking blue-green foliage that becomes more intense in cooler weather. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear slender, two-rowed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
