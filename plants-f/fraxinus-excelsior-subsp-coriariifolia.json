    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior subsp. coriariifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long. The leaves are usually opposite, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open habitats."
