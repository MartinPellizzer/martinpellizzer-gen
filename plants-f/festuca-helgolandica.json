    "intro": "Festuca helgolandica, commonly known as Helgoland fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and wind. Festuca helgolandica is also adapted to coastal dunes and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its ecological importance lies in its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various small organisms."
