    "intro": "Festuca eriostoma, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca eriostoma produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
