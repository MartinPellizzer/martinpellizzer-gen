    "intro": "Festuca decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed among the foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its surroundings. Festuca decipiens is notable for its deceptive appearance, which can make it difficult to distinguish from other fescue species."
