    "intro": "Festuca gigantea f. uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp tussock grass, is a variant of the tall fescue species native to wet, boggy environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, wet meadows, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated."
