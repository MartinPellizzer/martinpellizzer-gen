    "intro": "Flickingeria tricarinata, commonly known as the three-ribbed fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant's rhizomes are slender and produce a dense network of roots that anchor it in moist, shaded habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Flickingeria tricarinata is considered a species of conservation concern."
