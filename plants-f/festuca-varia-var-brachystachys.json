    "intro": "Festuca varia var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
