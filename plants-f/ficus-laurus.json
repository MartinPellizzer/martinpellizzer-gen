    "intro": "Ficus laurus, commonly known as the laurel fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus laurus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying properties."
