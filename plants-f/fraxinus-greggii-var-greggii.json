    "intro": "Fraxinus greggii var. greggii, commonly known as Gregg's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 feet, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, winged fruits that disperse by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
