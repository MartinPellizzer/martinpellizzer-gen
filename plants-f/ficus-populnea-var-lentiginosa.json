    "intro": "Ficus populnea var. lentiginosa, commonly known as the spotted fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and feature a unique spotted or mottled pattern that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
