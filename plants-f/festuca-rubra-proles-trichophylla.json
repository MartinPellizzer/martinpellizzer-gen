    "intro": "Festuca rubra proles trichophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive reddish coloration, especially under stress conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in lawns and turfgrass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological and horticultural applications."
