    "intro": "Fagraea umbelliflora, commonly known as the white star tree or umbrella tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Fagraea umbelliflora is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
