    "intro": "Fimbristylis novae-britanniae, commonly known as the New Britain fimbry, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Britain in the Pacific. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, tropical environments, often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
