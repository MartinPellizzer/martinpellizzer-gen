    "intro": "Forbesia, commonly known as the \"false heather,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to southern Africa. The plants typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Forbesia species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrive in well-drained conditions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their compact growth and long blooming periods."
