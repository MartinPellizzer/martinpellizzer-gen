    "intro": "Flourensia thurifera var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf flourensia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
