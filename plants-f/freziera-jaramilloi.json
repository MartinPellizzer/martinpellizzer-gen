    "intro": "Freziera jaramilloi, commonly known as the Jaramillo's freziera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andes of Ecuador. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a dense, compact form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freziera jaramilloi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
