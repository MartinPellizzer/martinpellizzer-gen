It is characterized by its wide, flat blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and has a clump-forming structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Festuca latifolia is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
