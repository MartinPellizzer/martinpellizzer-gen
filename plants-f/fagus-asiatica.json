    "intro": "Fagus asiatica, commonly known as the Asian beech, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky samaras as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests. The leaves and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits."
