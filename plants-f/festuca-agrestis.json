    "intro": "Festuca agrestis, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy and slightly rough to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Festuca agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
