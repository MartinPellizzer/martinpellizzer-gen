    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subsp. valesiaca, commonly known as the Valesiaca fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This subspecies thrives in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous slender, two-keeled spikelets. Festuca duriuscula subsp. valesiaca is valued for its ecological role in mountain ecosystems and its potential use in restoration projects."
