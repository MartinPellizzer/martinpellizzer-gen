It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
