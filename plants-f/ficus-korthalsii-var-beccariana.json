    "intro": "Ficus korthalsii var. beccariana, commonly known as the Beccarian fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green to yellowish in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
