    "intro": "Fluggea, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Fluggea malabrica, which is native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often spiny leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers. They thrive in saline or brackish environments, making them common in coastal areas and estuaries. Fluggea species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
