    "intro": "Fremontia, commonly known as the nightshade or the California nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which open in the evening. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, and it produces small, toxic berries that contain alkaloids. Fremontia is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potentially harmful properties."
