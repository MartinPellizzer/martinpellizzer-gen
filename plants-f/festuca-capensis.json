    "intro": "Festuca capensis, commonly known as the Cape bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to thrive in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Festuca capensis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
