    "intro": "Ficus glabella, commonly known as the smooth fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus glabella thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
