    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-elevation environments."
