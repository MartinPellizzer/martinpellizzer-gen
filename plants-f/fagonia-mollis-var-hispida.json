    "intro": "Fagonia mollis var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features branched stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
