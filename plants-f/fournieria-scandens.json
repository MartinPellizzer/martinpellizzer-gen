    "intro": "Fournieria scandens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veined pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ground cover in horticultural settings."
