    "intro": "Ficus bougainvillei, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that surround small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its colorful bracts. Ficus bougainvillei thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
