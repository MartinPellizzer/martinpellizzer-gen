    "intro": "Fumaria cucullaria, commonly known as the helmeted fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its name derives from the distinctive helmet-like shape of its seed pods."
