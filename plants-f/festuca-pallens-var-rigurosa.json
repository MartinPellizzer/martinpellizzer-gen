    "intro": "Festuca pallens var. rigurosa, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and dense, tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its foliage is covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, contributing to its common name. Festuca pallens var. rigurosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
