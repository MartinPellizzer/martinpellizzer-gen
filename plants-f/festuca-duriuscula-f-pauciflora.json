    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered fescue, is a hemicryptophytic perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. The plant features dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single or few spikelets, which are small and compact, characteristic of the Poaceae family. Due to its limited floral display, it is often overlooked but plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
