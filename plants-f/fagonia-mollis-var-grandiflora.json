    "intro": "Fagonia mollis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with multiple branches covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its harsh, dry environment. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
