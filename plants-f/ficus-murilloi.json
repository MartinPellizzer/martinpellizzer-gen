    "intro": "Ficus murilloi, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive, cascading pattern. The plant has a shallow root system, making it sensitive to changes in its environment, such as temperature and light. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. Ficus murilloi is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
