    "intro": "Fagara niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederlein's soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or orange when ripe. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts within its native range."
