    "intro": "Ficus samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the islands of Samoa and American Samoa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and lowland areas. Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it is also valued for ornamental purposes in horticulture."
