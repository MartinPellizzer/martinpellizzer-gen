    "intro": "Ficus tondana, commonly known as the Tondana fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs. Ficus tondana thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
