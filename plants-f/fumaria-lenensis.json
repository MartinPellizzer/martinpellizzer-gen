    "intro": "Fumaria lenensis, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this herbaceous perennial thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
