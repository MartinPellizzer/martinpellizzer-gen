    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
