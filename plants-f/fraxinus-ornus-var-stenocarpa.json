It is characterized by its pendulous branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish-brown in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by narrow, elongated fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its graceful appearance."
