    "intro": "Ficus rigidula, commonly known as the rigid fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and it produces edible figs that are important for both wildlife and local communities. Ficus rigidula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
