It is characterized by its showy, yellow, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that resemble lanterns, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The leaves are typically simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge."
