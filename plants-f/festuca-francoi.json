    "intro": "Festuca francoi, commonly known as French bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca francoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its delicate appearance."
