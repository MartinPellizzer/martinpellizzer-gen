    "intro": "Ferula seravschanica, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and tall, branched inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, and its taproot is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Ferula seravschanica is also valued for its essential oils, which are extracted from its roots and used in perfumery and aromatherapy. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various pollinators and small desert animals."
