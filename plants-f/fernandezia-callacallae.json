    "intro": "Fernandezia callacallae, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Fernandezia callacallae plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
