    "intro": "Festuca curvula subsp. cagiriensis, commonly known as the Cagiri bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces viable seeds that aid in its propagation. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
