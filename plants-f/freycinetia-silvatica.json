    "intro": "Freycinetia silvatica, commonly known as the mountain cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
