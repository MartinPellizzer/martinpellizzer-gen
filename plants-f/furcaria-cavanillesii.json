    "intro": "Furcaria cavanillesii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
