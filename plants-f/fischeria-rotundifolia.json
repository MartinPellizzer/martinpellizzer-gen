    "intro": "Fischeria rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed fischeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It features rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Fischeria rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
