    "intro": "Fraxinus atrovirens, commonly known as the black ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. The tree is often found in moist, swampy areas and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
