    "intro": "Festuca remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Festuca remotiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
