    "intro": "Festuca marina, commonly known as saltmeadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity and frequent flooding. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, stabilizing coastal soils. Festuca marina plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and reducing erosion."
