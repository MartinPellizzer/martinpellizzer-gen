    "intro": "Festuca pallens subsp. psammophila, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species adapted to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish florets. It is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and other dry, disturbed soils. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
