    "intro": "Frankenia tetrapetala var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The species is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
