    "intro": "Fritillaria verticillata var. jimunaica, commonly known as the Jimunaica fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
