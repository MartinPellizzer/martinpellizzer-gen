    "intro": "Festuca viridula, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Festuca viridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
