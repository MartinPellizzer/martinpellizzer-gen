    "intro": "Fagonia jolyi, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its thick, waxy leaves help reduce water loss, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Fagonia jolyi plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
