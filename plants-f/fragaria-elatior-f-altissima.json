    "intro": "Fragaria elatior f. altissima, commonly known as the tall strawberry, is a botanical variant of the common strawberry. It is characterized by its elongated, more upright growth habit compared to the typical strawberry plant. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is similar to the common strawberry but tends to be larger and less intensely flavored. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a hardy alternative to traditional strawberries."
