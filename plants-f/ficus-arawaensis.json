    "intro": "Ficus arawaensis, commonly known as the Arawa fig, is a small evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered fruit that ripens to a yellowish-green color, attracting various native birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
