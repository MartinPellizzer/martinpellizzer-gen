    "intro": "Frankenia fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's frankenia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in spring, are clustered in dense inflorescences, making it visually striking. Frankenia fischeri is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
