    "intro": "Fagus latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Fagus latifolia plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
