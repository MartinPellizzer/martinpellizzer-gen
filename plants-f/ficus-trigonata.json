    "intro": "Ficus trigonata, commonly known as the triangular fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three elongated, lance-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fig fruits. Ficus trigonata thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
