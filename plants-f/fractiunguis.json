    "intro": "Fractiunguis, commonly known as the shattered leaf plant, is a rare species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that appear to be fragmented, giving it its unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring season, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Fractiunguis is considered a conservation concern."
