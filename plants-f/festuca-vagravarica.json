    "intro": "Festuca vagravarica, commonly known as the wandering fescue, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca vagravarica is adapted to grow in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivorous insects and small mammals."
