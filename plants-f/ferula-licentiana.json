    "intro": "Ferula licentiana, commonly known as the Sicilian cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant features slender, hollow stems and small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle anise-like fragrance when crushed. Ferula licentiana is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
