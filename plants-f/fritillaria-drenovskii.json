    "intro": "Fritillaria drenovskii, commonly known as the Drenovskii's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
