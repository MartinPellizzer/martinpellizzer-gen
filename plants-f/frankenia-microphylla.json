    "intro": "Frankenia microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
