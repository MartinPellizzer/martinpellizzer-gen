    "intro": "Forrestia tenuis, commonly known as the slender forestia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal flowering, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. It is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, which is a key adaptation to its natural habitat."
