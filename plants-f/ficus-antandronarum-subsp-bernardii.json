    "intro": "Ficus antandronarum subsp. bernardii, commonly known as the Bernard's fig, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the humid and tropical conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
