    "intro": "Ficus corylifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf fig or Chinese ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically consumed when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus corylifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and ability to adapt to indoor environments."
