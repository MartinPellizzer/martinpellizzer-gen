    "intro": "Freziera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy freziera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Freziera hirsuta is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
