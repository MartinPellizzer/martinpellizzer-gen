    "intro": "Ferocactus fordii, commonly known as the Ford's barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are typically yellow to reddish in color, providing protection from herbivores. Ferocactus fordii is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
