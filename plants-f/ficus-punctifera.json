    "intro": "Ficus punctifera, commonly known as the spotted fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or pale spots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus punctifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
