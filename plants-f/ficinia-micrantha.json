The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, which are a defining feature of the sedge family. Ficinia micrantha thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
