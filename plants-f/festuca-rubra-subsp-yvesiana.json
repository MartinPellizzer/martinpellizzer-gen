    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. yvesiana, commonly known as Yves' bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like flowers that are usually pale green to reddish in color. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
