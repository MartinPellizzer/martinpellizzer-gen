    "intro": "Festuca jensenii, commonly known as Jensen's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color and have a slight pubescence, contributing to its drought tolerance. Festuca jensenii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
