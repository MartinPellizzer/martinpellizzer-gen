It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, round, green fig fruits that turn yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
