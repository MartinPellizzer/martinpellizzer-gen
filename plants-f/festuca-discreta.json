    "intro": "Festuca discreta, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender stems, and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca discreta produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
