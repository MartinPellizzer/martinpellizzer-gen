It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, making it visually appealing in gardens. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Moleroi fescue is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry, rocky environments."
