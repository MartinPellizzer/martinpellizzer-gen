    "intro": "Fouquieria, commonly known as the ocotillo, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their tall, branching stems and clusters of small, often yellow, flowers. Fouquieria species are adapted to drought conditions, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. They typically shed their leaves during dry seasons, making them appear almost leafless. The genus includes several species, such as Fouquieria splendens, which is known for its striking appearance during flowering."
