    "intro": "Ficus hispidioides, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically yellow or reddish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to various conditions, it is cultivated as a houseplant in many regions."
