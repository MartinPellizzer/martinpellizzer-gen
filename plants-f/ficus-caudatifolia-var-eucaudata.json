    "intro": "Ficus caudatifolia var. eucaudata, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a waxy surface and a prominent midrib. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. This plant is well-suited for humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental or for its fruit."
