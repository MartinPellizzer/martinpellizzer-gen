    "intro": "Farsetia divaricata, commonly known as the creeping forest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features slender, creeping rhizomes that give rise to bipinnate leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Farsetia divaricata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in woodland settings."
