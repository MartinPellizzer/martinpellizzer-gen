    "intro": "Ficaria verna f. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaved winter creeper, is a variant of the common winter creeper, characterized by its elongated, trailing stems and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late winter or early spring, followed by pale yellow berries that are attractive to birds. It has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover in shady gardens. Its botanical features make it an effective plant for stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
