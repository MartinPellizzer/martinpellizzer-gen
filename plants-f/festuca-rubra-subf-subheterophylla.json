    "intro": "Festuca rubra subf. subheterophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit. It exhibits dimorphic leaf blades, with some leaves being narrow and grass-like while others are broader and more succulent, a feature that aids in its adaptability to varying environmental conditions. This subspecies is typically found in moist, acidic soils and is often used in turfgrass and restoration projects due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded areas, making it a popular choice for landscaping in woodland settings. The plant's rhizomatous growth helps it form dense mats, which contribute to its erosion control capabilities."
