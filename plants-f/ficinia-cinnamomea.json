    "intro": "Ficinia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that resemble the shape of a fern, though it is not a true fern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, cinnamon-colored coating, which gives it its common name. Ficinia cinnamomea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
