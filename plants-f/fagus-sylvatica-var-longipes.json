    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. longipes, commonly known as the European beech, is a variant of the common beech that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its elongated leaves, which are typically longer and more pointed than those of the standard variety. The tree produces small, rounded nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are a key feature of its reproductive biology. Its leaves are deciduous, turning yellow in autumn before falling, and its bark is smooth and gray in youth. This variant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates."
