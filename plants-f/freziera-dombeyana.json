It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Freziera dombeyana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates."
