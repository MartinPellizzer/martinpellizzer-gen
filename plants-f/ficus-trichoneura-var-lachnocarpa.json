It belongs to the Moraceae family and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is known for its ability to form a dense canopy, creating a unique microhabitat for various organisms. Its fruit, which is a small, edible fig, plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and mammals. The plant's adaptability to humid climates and its rapid growth make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
