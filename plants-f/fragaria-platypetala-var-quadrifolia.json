    "intro": "Fragaria platypetala var. quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf strawberry, is a rare and unique variant of the strawberry plant. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that often have four lobes, giving it its distinctive name. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are similar in flavor to regular strawberries but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, woodland areas. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often grown in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
