    "intro": "Ficus papyrifera, commonly known as the paper fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are thick and waxy, often with a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in a spherical shape. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus papyrifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
