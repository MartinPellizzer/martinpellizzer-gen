    "intro": "Fargesia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag bamboo, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems that often exhibit a zigzag growth pattern. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, pale green to white flowers in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and turn yellow in autumn before falling off. Fargesia obliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance and hardiness."
