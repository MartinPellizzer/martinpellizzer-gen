    "intro": "Festuca montana var. altissima, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca montana var. altissima is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
