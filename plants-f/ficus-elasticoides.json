    "intro": "Ficus elasticoides, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant is known for its ability to produce a milky latex sap, which is used in the production of rubber. Its roots form a dense, fibrous network that helps stabilize the soil. Ficus elasticoides thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
