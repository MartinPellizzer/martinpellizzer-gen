    "intro": "Festuca vivipara subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and smooth, with a bluish-green coloration, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
