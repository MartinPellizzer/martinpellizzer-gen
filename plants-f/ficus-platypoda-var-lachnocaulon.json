    "intro": "Ficus platypoda var. lachnocaulon, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, waxy texture. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
