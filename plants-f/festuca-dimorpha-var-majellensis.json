    "intro": "Festuca dimorpha var. majellensis, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
