    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. pendula, commonly known as weeping ash, is a cultivar of the common ash tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often planted in gardens and parks, though it is susceptible to ash dieback disease."
