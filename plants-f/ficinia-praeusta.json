    "intro": "Ficinia praeusta, commonly known as the New Zealand native fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories throughout New Zealand. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Ficinia praeusta plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
