    "intro": "Fagonia isotricha f. brevistipulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Fagonia isotricha f. brevistipulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
