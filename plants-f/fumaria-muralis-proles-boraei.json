    "intro": "Fumaria muralis proles boraei, commonly known as the Arctic wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Fumaria muralis proles boraei plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to survive in extreme seasonal conditions."
