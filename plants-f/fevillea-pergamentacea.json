    "intro": "Fevillea pergamentacea, commonly known as the parchment fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, papery fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Fevillea pergamentacea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories."
