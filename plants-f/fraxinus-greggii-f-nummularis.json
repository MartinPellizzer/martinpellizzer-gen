    "intro": "Fraxinus greggii f. nummularis, commonly known as the Nummular Leaf Ash, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the ash tree. It is characterized by its unique, rounded, coin-shaped leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant is native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes for its visual appeal."
