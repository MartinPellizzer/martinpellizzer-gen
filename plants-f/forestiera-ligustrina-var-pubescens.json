    "intro": "Forestiera ligustrina var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable plant for woodland gardens. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
