    "intro": "Fraxinus calabrica, commonly known as the California ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201325 feet and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. Fraxinus calabrica is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
