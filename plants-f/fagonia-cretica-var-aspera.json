It is characterized by its branched, often spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
