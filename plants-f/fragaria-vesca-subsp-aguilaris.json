    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subsp. aguilaris, commonly known as the Aguilar strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
