    "intro": "Festuca simplex, commonly known as slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, dark green leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges. Festuca simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive lawns. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and environmental adaptability."
