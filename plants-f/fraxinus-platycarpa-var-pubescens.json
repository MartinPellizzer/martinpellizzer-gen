    "intro": "Fraxinus platycarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent ash, is a variant of the flat-fruit ash. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The pubescent variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and young shoots, giving it a unique appearance compared to other ash species."
