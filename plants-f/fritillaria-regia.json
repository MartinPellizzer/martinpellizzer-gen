    "intro": "Fritillaria regia, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, erect stems that bear large, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, arranged in a crown-like pattern. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with many clustered blooms, giving it its common name. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters and bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from the base of the plant."
