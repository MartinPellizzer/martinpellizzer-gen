    "intro": "Friesodielsia albida, commonly known as the white-flowered fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, light green fronds that often have a silvery-white underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Friesodielsia albida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
