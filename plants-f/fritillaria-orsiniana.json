    "intro": "Fritillaria orsiniana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
