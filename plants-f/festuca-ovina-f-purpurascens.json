    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. purpurascens, commonly known as purple sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense foliage. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in mountainous regions and alpine meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green, with a distinctive purple tinge on the lower surface, especially under certain light conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is also used in landscaping and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
