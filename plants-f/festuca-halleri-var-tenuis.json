    "intro": "Festuca halleri var. tenuis, commonly known as slender hill fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates. Festuca halleri var. tenuis is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
