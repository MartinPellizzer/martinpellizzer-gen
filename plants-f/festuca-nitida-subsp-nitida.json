    "intro": "Festuca nitida subsp. nitida, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its silvery sheen. It typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Festuca nitida subsp. nitida is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental grass due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
