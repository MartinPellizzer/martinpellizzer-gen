    "intro": "Ficus formosa, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white or cream variegation. It is a popular houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus formosa produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not cultivated for consumption."
