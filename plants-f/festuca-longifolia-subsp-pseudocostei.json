    "intro": "Festuca longifolia subsp. pseudocostei, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
