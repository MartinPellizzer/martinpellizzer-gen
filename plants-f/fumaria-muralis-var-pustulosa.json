    "intro": "Fumaria muralis var. pustulosa, commonly known as the spotted fumitory, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive, rounded, pustular structures on the stems, which give it its specific name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy habitats."
