It is a small, terrestrial herb with a single, erect stem that bears a few leaves. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
