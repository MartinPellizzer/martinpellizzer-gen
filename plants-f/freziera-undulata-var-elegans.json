    "intro": "Freziera undulata var. elegans, commonly known as the wavy freziera, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
