    "intro": "Festuca pratensis var. humilior, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its dense growth and tolerance to grazing, it is an important component of many grassland ecosystems."
