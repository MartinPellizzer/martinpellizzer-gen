    "intro": "Ficus spragueana, commonly known as the Sprague's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits, though these are often not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value. The leaves are also known for their ability to filter air pollutants, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
