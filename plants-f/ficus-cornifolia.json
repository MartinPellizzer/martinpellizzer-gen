    "intro": "Ficus cornifolia, commonly known as the horned fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, waxy leaves that often have a horn-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. Ficus cornifolia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
