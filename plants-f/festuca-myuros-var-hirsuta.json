    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy meadow fescue, is a variant of the meadow fescue species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its flowering stems produce spikelets with small, awned flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
