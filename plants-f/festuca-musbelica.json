    "intro": "Festuca musbelica, commonly known as Meadow Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca musbelica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
