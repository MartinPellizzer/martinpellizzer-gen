    "intro": "Ficus guyeri var. minimifolia, commonly known as the miniature fig or dwarf ficus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
