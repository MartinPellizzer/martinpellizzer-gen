    "intro": "Funkiella stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping funkiella, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit. It produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Funariaceae family, commonly found in temperate regions."
