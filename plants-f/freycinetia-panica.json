    "intro": "Freycinetia panica, commonly known as the pandanus or screw pine, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody, spiky fruits. Freycinetia panica is adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in both horticulture and island ecosystems."
