    "intro": "Ficus petrophila, commonly known as the rock fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. This species thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. Its ability to grow on rocky surfaces makes it well adapted to limestone and other mineral-rich substrates."
