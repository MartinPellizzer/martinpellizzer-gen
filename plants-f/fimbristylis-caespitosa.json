    "intro": "Fimbristylis caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown and are adapted for wind pollination. Fimbristylis caespitosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
