    "intro": "Feuilleea microphylla, commonly known as the tiny-leaf fern, is a unique species characterized by its small, delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions with high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually across moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and exhibit a light green color with a finely textured surface. Feuilleea microphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
