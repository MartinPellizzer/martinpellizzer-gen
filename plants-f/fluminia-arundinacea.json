    "intro": "Fluminia arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 4 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a slightly hairy surface. Fluminia arundinacea is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
