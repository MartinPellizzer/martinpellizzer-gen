    "intro": "Fumaria agraria var. platyptera, commonly known as the broad-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in meadows. Its seed pods are dehiscent, splitting open to release small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional remedies for skin conditions."
