It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. Festuca agrostoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
