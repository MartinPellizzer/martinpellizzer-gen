It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that contain two winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with longitudinal ridges that become more pronounced with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and structural form."
