    "intro": "Festuca boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyacensis fescue, is a grass species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. Festuca boyacensis has small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
