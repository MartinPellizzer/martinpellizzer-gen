    "intro": "Festuca communis, commonly known as common fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Festuca communis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
