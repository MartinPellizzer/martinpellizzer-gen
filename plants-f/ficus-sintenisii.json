It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often shaped like a shield. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when mature. It is a popular houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements. Ficus sintenisii thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moderate humidity and well-draining soil."
