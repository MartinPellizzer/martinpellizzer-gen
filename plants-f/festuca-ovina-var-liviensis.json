    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. liviensis, commonly known as the Alpine sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are adapted to cold and arid environments. This variety thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family."
