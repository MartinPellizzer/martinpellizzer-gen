    "intro": "Fernandezia ecallosa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are covered in a fine, smooth cuticle. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Fernandezia ecallosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
