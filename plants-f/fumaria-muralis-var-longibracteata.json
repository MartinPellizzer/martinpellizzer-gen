    "intro": "Fumaria muralis var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract wall rue, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated bracts that enclose the flower buds, giving it its specific variety name. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found growing on walls or in cracks in stone. This variety is less common than the typical form of Fumaria muralis and is valued for its unique floral structure and ecological niche."
