    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. juncifolia, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and along stream banks. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Festuca rubra subsp. juncifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
