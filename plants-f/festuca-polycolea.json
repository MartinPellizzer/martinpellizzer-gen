    "intro": "Festuca polycolea, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically purple or pink in color. Festuca polycolea is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
