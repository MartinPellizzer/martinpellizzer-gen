    "intro": "Festuca bidenticulata, commonly known as the two-toothed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toothed structures at the base of the leaf blades. Festuca bidenticulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
