    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. filiformis, commonly known as bluegrass or silvergrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that is often covered with a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
