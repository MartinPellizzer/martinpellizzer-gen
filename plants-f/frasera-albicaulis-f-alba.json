    "intro": "Frasera albicaulis f. alba, commonly known as the White Frasera, is a rare and striking plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the Gelsemiaceae family and is characterized by its showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species and is often protected in conservation efforts."
