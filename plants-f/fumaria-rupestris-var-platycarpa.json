It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground or in crevices. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, adapted to reduce water loss. It is often found in limestone areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
