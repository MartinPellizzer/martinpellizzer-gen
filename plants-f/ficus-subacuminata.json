    "intro": "Ficus subacuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are enclosed in a spherical, greenish husk. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus subacuminata is also valued for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
