    "intro": "Faberia pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved faberia, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Faberia pinnatifida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
