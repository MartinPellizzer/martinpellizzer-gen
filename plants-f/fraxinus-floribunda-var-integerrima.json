    "intro": "Fraxinus floribunda var. integerrima, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 5 to 9 ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaroid fruits that are winged and dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ecological importance and historical use in woodworking."
