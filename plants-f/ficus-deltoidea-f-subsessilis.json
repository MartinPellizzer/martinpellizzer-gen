    "intro": "Ficus deltoidea f. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Ficus deltoidea. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are often green or yellowish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This cultivar is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
