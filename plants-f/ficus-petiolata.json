    "intro": "Ficus petiolata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are usually heart-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, edible figs that turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in landscaping. Ficus petiolata is also popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
