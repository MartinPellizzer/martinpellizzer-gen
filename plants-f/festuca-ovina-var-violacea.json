    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. violacea, commonly known as purple sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive violet to bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
