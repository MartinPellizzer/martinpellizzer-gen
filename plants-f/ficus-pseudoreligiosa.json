It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a dense canopy of broad, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are clustered in syconia. Its roots system is extensive and can form a network that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates."
