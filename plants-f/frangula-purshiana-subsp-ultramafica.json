    "intro": "Frangula purshiana subsp. ultramafica, commonly known as the ultramafic frangula, is a shrub native to the western United States. It thrives in nutrient-poor, ultramafic soils, which are rich in magnesium and iron but low in essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are aggregate berries that ripen to a deep red color, attracting various bird species. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
