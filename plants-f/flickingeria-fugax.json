    "intro": "Flickingeria fugax, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom on a single, slender stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are small, strap-shaped, and often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Flickingeria fugax is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
