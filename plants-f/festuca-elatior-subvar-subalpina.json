It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
