    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. profunda, commonly known as the deep-rooted American ash, is a variant of the American ash tree characterized by its deep and extensive root system. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows as a tall, straight tree with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds."
