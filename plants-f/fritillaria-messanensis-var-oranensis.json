It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically found in dry, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
