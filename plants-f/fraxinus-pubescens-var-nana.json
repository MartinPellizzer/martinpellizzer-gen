    "intro": "Fraxinus pubescens var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf green ash, is a compact, shrub-like form of the green ash tree. It features small, ovate leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
