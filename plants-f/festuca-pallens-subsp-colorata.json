    "intro": "Festuca pallens subsp. colorata, commonly known as the purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage with a distinctive purple tinge on the leaves, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy, drought-resistant nature."
