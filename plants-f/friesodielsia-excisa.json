    "intro": "Friesodielsia excisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves that are closely arranged along its branches. The plant produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, and it is often found in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. Friesodielsia excisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
