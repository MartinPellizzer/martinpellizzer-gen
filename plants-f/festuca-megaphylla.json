    "intro": "Festuca megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca megaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
