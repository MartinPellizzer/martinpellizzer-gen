    "intro": "Ficinia scariosa, commonly known as the scarious ficinia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, scaly texture, which gives it its scientific name. Ficinia scariosa produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences."
