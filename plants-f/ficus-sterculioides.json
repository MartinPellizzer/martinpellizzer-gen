It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive aerial roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fig-like fruits, which are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The tree is also valued for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its resilience to urban environments."
