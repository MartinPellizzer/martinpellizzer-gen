    "intro": "Fraxinus streptocarpa, commonly known as the Canadian ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter beneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
