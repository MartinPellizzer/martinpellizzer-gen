    "intro": "Fagonia tristis, commonly known as the bitterweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family, characterized by its succulent stems and reduced leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its fruits are small, dry capsules containing seeds. Fagonia tristis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance as a food source for certain desert wildlife."
