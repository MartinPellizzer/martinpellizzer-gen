    "intro": "Fragaria vesca f. helleri, commonly known as the Heller's strawberry, is a botanical variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its smaller, more elongated leaves compared to the typical Fragaria vesca. The flowers are generally white with a slight pinkish hue, and the fruit is a small, tart red berry. This form is often found in shaded, woodland environments where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in horticulture."
