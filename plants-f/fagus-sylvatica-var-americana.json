    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. americana, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval, serrated leaves. The tree produces small, spiny nuts enclosed in a cupule, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The American beech is also valued for its durable wood and its role in ecological succession."
