    "intro": "Fagraea ceilanica, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and striking clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces small, red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Fagraea ceilanica is also valued for its wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
