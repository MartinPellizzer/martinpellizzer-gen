    "intro": "Festuca colorata, commonly known as the red grass or red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its striking reddish-purple foliage, which becomes more vibrant during the autumn months. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Festuca colorata is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
