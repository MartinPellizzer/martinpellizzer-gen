    "intro": "Ferula mervynii, commonly known as the Mervyn's giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of fennel. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Ferula mervynii thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
