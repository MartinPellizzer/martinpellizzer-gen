    "intro": "Fraxinus glauca, commonly known as the blue ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The blue ash is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
