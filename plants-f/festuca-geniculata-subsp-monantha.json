    "intro": "Festuca geniculata subsp. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with single flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally bluish-green and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This subspecies is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
