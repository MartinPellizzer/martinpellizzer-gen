    "intro": "Flindersia maculosa, commonly known as the spotted flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange or red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
