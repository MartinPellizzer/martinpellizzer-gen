    "intro": "Fitchia cuneata subsp. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fitchia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
