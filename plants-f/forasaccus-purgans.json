It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a robust root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Forasaccus purgans plays an important role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and oxygenating the water."
