    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria, commonly known as meadow sweet, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-orange anthers that release pollen, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, aromatic scent. Filipendula ulmaria is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
