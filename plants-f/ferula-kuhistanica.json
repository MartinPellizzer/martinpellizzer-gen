    "intro": "Ferula kuhistanica, commonly known as Kuhistan giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula kuhistanica is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, arid conditions with well-drained soils."
