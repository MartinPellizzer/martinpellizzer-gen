    "intro": "Fraxinus teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters with a slender, often multi-stemmed trunk. The leaves are opposite, simple, and lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a distinct, tapering point. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. The tree is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed hardwood forests."
