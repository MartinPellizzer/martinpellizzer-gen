    "intro": "Fissipes acaulis f. lancifolia, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rock cress, is a variant of the rock cress species characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves. It is a low-growing plant with a compact, often cushion-like form, adapted to thrive in rocky or alpine environments. The leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps to minimize water loss and maximize light absorption. Its flowers are small and white or pale yellow, clustered in racemes, and bloom in early spring. This subspecies is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
