    "intro": "Falimiria coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant's fronds are usually arranged in a spiral pattern, with each leaflet being narrow and tapering toward the tip. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Falimiria coarctata plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
