    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. panciciana, commonly known as the Pancician sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca ovina var. panciciana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
