    "intro": "Feuilleea lentiscifolia, commonly known as the spiny leaf euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are cylindrical and can branch out, forming a shrub-like structure. Feuilleea lentiscifolia is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems to endure prolonged droughts."
