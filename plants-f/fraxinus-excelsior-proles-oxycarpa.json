    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior proles oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by elongated, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland areas. However, it is susceptible to ash dieback, a serious fungal disease that has impacted ash populations across Europe."
