    "intro": "Freycinetia spinellosa, commonly known as the spinellosa cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical environment. Freycinetia spinellosa is notable for its ornamental value and is also of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance."
