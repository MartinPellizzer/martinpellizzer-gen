    "intro": "Fragariastrum doddsii, commonly known as the Dodds' strawberry, is a rare and endemic plant found primarily in New Zealand. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible berries that resemble those of the common strawberry. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it produces white flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
