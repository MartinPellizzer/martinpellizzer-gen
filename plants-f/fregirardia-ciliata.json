    "intro": "Fregirardia ciliata, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are covered in delicate, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
