    "intro": "Fritillaria oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival during dry periods, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
