    "intro": "Fritillaria parvialbiflora var. viridicaulina, commonly known as the greenstem fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-yellow flowers with contrasting red and orange markings. The plant's unique foliage and floral coloration make it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
