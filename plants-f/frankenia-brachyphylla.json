    "intro": "Frankenia brachyphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. Frankenia brachyphylla is often found in dune ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
