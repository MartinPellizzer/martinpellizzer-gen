    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifoliate ash, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of the brake fern, giving it a unique appearance. This form is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in woodland areas. The leaves are usually longer and more delicate than those of the typical ash, and the plant tends to grow as a shrub rather than a tree. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
