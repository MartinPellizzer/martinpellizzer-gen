It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically violet or purple in color, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca violacea subsp. minor is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats."
