    "intro": "Ferulago scabra, commonly known as the rough ferulago, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb with hairy, branched stems that often grow in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. Ferulago scabra is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
