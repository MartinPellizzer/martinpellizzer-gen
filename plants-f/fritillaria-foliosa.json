    "intro": "Fritillaria foliosa, commonly known as the leafy fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with a distinctive black or dark purple pattern. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions and bloom reliably each year. Fritillaria foliosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
