    "intro": "Fimbristylis spadicea var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as swamps and marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. The variety name *ferruginea* refers to the reddish-brown coloration observed in its inflorescence and stems."
