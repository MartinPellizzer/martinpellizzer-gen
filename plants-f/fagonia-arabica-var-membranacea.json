It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and smooth, pale green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for harsh desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
