    "intro": "Fessia olangensis, commonly known as the Olangenish fessia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
