    "intro": "Fimbristylis juncea var. tertia, commonly known as the slender threadgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
