    "intro": "Festuca tatrae, commonly known as Tatra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Festuca tatrae plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing forage for alpine livestock. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
