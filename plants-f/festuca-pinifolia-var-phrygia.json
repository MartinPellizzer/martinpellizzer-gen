    "intro": "Festuca pinifolia var. phrygia, commonly known as Phrygian sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
