    "intro": "Friesodielsia paucinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a unique member of the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are often found along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized fern species."
