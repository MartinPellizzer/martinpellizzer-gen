    "intro": "Festuca ovina proles stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in landscaping and erosion control in suitable climates."
