    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. mutica, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its hardiness. Festuca rubra var. mutica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
