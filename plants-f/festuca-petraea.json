    "intro": "Festuca petraea, commonly known as mountain grass or rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce light blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca petraea is adapted to harsh conditions, including cold temperatures and low nutrient availability. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in mountainous regions."
