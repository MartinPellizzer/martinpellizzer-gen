    "intro": "Ficus hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible but often not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus hamiltoniana is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
