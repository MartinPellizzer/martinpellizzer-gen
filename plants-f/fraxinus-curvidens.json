    "intro": "Fraxinus curvidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Fraxinus curvidens is relatively shade-tolerant and can thrive in a variety of woodland habitats."
