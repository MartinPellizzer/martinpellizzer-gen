    "intro": "Ficus nuruensis, commonly known as the Nuru Island Fig, is a tropical plant native to the island of Nuru in the Indian Ocean. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible fig fruits, which are a vital food source for local wildlife and humans. Its roots system is extensive, helping to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat. The tree thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall, making it well adapted to the tropical rainforests of its region."
