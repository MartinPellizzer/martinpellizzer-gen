    "intro": "Filicium decipiens f. apterum, commonly known as the false fern, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Filicales. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of true ferns, though it is not a true fern but a member of the order Polypodiales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are usually creeping and produce short, spore-bearing leaves. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its elegant, lace-like appearance."
