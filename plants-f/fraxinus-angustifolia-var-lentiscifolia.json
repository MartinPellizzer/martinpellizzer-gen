    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. lentiscifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
