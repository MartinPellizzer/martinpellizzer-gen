    "intro": "Flagellaria repens, commonly known as the creeping flagellaria, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are usually lanceolate in shape. Flagellaria repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications are not extensively documented."
