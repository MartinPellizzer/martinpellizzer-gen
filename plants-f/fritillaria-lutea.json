    "intro": "Fritillaria lutea, commonly known as the yellow fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 centimeters and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often appearing after the flowers have faded. The bulbs of Fritillaria lutea are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in dry, rocky habitats."
