It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but are often smaller and more acidic in taste. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. Fragaria hayatae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique flavor and medicinal properties."
