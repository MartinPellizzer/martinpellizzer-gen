    "intro": "Ferula foliosa, commonly known as the leafy ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, umbel-like inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and contain a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. Ferula foliosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
