    "intro": "Ficinia, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are characterized by their thick, often swollen stems that store water, making them drought-resistant. Ficinia species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy, often yellow or white flowers. They are sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
