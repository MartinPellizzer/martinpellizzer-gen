    "intro": "Ficus antoniana, commonly known as the Antonian fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and distinctive, smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are typically clustered in small, round groups. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
