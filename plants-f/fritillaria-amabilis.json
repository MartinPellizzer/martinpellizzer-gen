    "intro": "Fritillaria amabilis, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a cluster of fleshy, white or pale pink bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cold winter dormancy period to bloom successfully. Fritillaria amabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
