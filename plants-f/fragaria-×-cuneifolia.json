It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and serrated, and its small, red berries that resemble those of true strawberries. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland and wetland habitats, where it forms dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
