    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. lemanii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a hemicryptophyte grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are often bluish-green due to dense pubescence, and it produces small, spike-like flowers in the summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
