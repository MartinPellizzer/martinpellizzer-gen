    "intro": "Fimbristylis holwayana, commonly known as the Holway's sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Fimbristylis holwayana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
