    "intro": "Fragaria filipendula, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red in color and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant has a low-growing habit with trifoliate leaves and runners that help it spread across rocky or alpine soils. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forested areas at high elevations. Its botanical features make it a popular species for cultivation in gardens with suitable conditions."
