    "intro": "Fraxinus amarissima, commonly known as the bitter ash, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Oleaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
