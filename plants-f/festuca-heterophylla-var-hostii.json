    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. hostii, commonly known as Hosta grass or Bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green to blue-gray foliage that forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
