    "intro": "Ficus rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically pear-shaped. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rugosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
