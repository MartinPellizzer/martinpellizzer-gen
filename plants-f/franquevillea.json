    "intro": "Franquevillea, commonly known as the \"cape ivy,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy, and they produce small, clustered flowers in various colors, including white, pink, and red. Franquevillea species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their attractive foliage and flowering display. They thrive in warm, sunny climates and are relatively drought-tolerant once established."
