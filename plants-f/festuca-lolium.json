    "intro": "Festuca lolium, commonly known as ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Ryegrass is widely used in pastures, lawns, and as a forage crop due to its rapid growth and high nutritional value. It is also an important component in turfgrass mixtures for sports fields and recreational areas."
