    "intro": "Fimbristylis annua, commonly known as the annual tussock sedge, is a flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments, such as marshes and floodplains. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. Fimbristylis annua is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
