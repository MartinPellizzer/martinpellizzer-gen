    "intro": "Filaginella baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal filaginella, is a rare and delicate moss species native to the Lake Baikal region in Russia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky substrates or in forest floors. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with dense, overlapping leaves that are often reddish in color. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
