    "intro": "Ferula rechingeri, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its most distinctive feature is the large, bulbous root, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of a milky sap. Ferula rechingeri thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes."
