    "intro": "Ficus asperior, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit, known as a fig, is typically green when immature and turns brown as it ripens. Ficus asperior is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
