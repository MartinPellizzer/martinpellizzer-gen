    "intro": "Ficus caulobotrya, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, or woolly bark, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
