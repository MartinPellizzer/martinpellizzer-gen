    "intro": "Festuca muralis, commonly known as wallgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found growing on rocky or sandy soils, especially in disturbed or urban environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for landscaping. Festuca muralis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal areas."
