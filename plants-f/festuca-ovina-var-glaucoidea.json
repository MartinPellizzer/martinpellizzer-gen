    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. glaucoidea, commonly known as blue sheep fescue, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in landscaping for its visual appeal and ecological benefits."
