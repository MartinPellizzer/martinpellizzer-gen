    "intro": "Fimbristylis dauciformis, commonly known as the spiny flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common species in wetland ecosystems. Fimbristylis dauciformis is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats."
