    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. floribunda, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense clusters of purple to blue-gray flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a silver-blue hue that adds ornamental value to gardens. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense, long-lasting turf in wet or shady conditions."
