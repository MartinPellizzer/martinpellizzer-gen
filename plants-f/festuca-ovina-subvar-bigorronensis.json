    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. bigorronensis, commonly known as the Bigorre bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees region of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered with a whitish bloom. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in mountain meadows and grassy slopes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense, sod-like mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in alpine ecosystems."
