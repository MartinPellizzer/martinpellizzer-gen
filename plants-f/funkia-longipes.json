    "intro": "Funkia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in shallow water and wetlands, often forming dense colonies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. Funkia longipes is valued in water gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to improve water quality."
