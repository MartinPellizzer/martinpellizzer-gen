It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically harvested when they turn a deep purple or black. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
