    "intro": "Fagopyrum convolvulus, commonly known as common cowparley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It is an annual or biennial herb that produces small, triangular seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
