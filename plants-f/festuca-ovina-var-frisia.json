    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. frisia, commonly known as Frisian sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, which is dense and mat-forming. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Festuca ovina var. frisia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
