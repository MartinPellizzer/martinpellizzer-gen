    "intro": "Fabiana foliosa, commonly known as the silver leaf or desert star, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Fabiana foliosa is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
