    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. argenteovariegata, commonly known as the silver-leaved ash. This varietal exhibits striking variegation on its leaves, with a combination of white, yellow, and green patterns that contrast sharply against the dark green background. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the typical ash species, and they turn a vibrant golden yellow in autumn. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks."
