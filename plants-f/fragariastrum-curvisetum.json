It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wild areas."
