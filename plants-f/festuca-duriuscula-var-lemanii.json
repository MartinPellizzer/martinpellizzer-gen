    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. lemanii, commonly known as Leman's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are small and spike-like, typically appearing in late summer, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
