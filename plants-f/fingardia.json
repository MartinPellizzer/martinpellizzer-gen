    "intro": "Fingardia, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking, pendulous yellow flowers that resemble small bells. The plant produces long, woody vines that can climb or trail along supports, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a smooth texture. Fingardia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm climates."
