    "intro": "Festuca glaucantha, commonly known as bluegrass or blue false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca glaucantha is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
