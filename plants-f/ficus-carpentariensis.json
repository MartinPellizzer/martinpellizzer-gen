    "intro": "Ficus carpentariensis, commonly known as the Carpentarian fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the islands of Vanuatu and Fiji, where it typically grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered fig fruits that are often used in local traditional practices. It is a deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with a dense canopy that provides shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
