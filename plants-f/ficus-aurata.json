    "intro": "Ficus aurata, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and cascading branches that give it a unique, tree-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals. Ficus aurata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
