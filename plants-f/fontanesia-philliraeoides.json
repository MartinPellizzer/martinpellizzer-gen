    "intro": "Fontanesia philliraeoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in the production of musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
