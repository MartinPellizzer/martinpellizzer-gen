    "intro": "Festuca chalcophaea, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with golden hues. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Festuca chalcophaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
