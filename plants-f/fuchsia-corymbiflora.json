    "intro": "Fuchsia corymbiflora, commonly known as the clustered fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its striking clusters of vibrant pink to purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are rich in nectar, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses, though it requires cool temperatures and well-drained soil to thrive."
