    "intro": "Festuca rubra proles vaudensis, commonly known as the Vaud bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Switzerland. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, compact growth habit. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in specialty turfgrass applications."
