    "intro": "Festuca sulcata var. angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf festuca, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with dense, tufted foliage that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
