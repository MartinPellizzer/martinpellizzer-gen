    "intro": "Festuca jeanpertii subsp. jeanpertii, commonly known as Jeanpert's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually greenish or pale blue in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
