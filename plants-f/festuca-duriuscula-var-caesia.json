It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces narrow, bluish-green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
