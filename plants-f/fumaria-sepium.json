    "intro": "Fumaria sepium, commonly known as yellow weed or lesser celandine, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Fumaria sepium is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
