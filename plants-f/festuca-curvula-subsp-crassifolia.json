    "intro": "Festuca curvula subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical *Festuca curvula*. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in ecological restoration projects."
