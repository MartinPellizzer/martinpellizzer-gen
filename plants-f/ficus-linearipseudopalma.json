    "intro": "Ficus linearipseudopalma, commonly known as the linear-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow, and waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, making it adaptable to various soil types. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible when ripe."
