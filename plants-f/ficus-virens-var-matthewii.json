    "intro": "Ficus virens var. matthewii, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, enhancing its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability and aesthetic value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
