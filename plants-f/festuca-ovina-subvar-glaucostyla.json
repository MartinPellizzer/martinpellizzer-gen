    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. glaucostyla, commonly known as the bluegrass fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-gray hue on the leaves, which gives it its common name. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for use in landscaping and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
