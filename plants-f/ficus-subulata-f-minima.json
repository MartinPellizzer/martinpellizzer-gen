    "intro": "Ficus subulata f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf ficus or miniature weeping fig, is a compact, ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elongated, pointed leaves that give it a delicate, weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in a bushy form with a short trunk, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Its slow growth rate and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for bonsai and small spaces."
