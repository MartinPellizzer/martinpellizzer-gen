    "intro": "Fourcroya tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous fourcroya, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients for the plant. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
