    "intro": "Festuca halleri var. aurata, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and bright golden-yellow inflorescences that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that emerge in early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact size and striking color make it a desirable addition to alpine and cottage gardens."
