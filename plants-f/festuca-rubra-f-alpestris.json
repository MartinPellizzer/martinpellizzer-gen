    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. alpestris, commonly known as alpine red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitude. Its leaves are often reddish in color, especially under stress, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky or barren landscapes."
