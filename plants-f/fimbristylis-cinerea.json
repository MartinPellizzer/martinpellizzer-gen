    "intro": "Fimbristylis cinerea, commonly known as silver hair sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, greenish-brown flowers. Fimbristylis cinerea is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
