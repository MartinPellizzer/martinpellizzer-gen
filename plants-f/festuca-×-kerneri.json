    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 kerneri, commonly known as Kernery fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
