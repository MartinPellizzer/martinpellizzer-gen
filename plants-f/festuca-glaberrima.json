    "intro": "Festuca glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Festuca glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
