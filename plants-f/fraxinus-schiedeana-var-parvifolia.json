    "intro": "Fraxinus schiedeana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Fraxinus species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a valued species in both natural and cultivated landscapes."
