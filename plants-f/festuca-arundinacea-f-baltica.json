It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense foliage, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color, with a rough texture. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly used in pastures and erosion control. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form extensive sods, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
