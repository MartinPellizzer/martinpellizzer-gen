    "intro": "Ficus carica var. rosa-nigra, commonly known as the black raspberry fig, is a unique variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its dark red to almost black fruits, which are typically smaller than those of the standard fig. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is primarily cultivated for its edible berries, which have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
