    "intro": "Ficus subinflata, commonly known as the inflated fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, swollen, waxy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
