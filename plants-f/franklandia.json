    "intro": "Franklandia, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking, butterfly-like flowers. Franklandia species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, meaning they attach themselves to trees or rocks for support. Their flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by attracting specific insects. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique and exotic appearance."
