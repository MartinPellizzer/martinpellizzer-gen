    "intro": "Florestina pedata, commonly known as the creeping forest fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant has delicate, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structure includes small, clustered spore-bearing fronds that develop on the underside of its leaves."
