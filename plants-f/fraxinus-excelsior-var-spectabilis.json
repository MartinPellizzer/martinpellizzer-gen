    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a vibrant green with a silvery underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that disperse easily by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
