    "intro": "Festuca dissitiflora subsp. loricata, commonly known as the woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly layer of hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically greenish to pale brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Festuca dissitiflora subsp. loricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
