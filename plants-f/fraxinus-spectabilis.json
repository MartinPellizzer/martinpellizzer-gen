    "intro": "Fraxinus spectabilis, commonly known as the showy ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its striking, upright clusters of white flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, winged samaras that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
