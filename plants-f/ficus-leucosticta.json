    "intro": "Ficus leucosticta, commonly known as the variegated rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or cream-colored veins and margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus leucosticta is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
