    "intro": "Festuca contracta, commonly known as narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca contracta is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
