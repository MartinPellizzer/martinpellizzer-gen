    "intro": "Fritillaria delphinensis subsp. moggridgei, commonly known as the Moggridge's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, which are typically a deep orange or red color with contrasting black veins. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
