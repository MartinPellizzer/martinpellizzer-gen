    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. radicans, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense mats of fine, dark green foliage and has slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, contributing to its spreading habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and ground cover. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions make it a versatile ornamental and ecological plant."
