    "intro": "Ficus terragena, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions. Ficus terragena is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to thrive in low-light settings."
