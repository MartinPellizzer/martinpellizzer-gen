    "intro": "Festuca lanata, commonly known as woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca lanata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
