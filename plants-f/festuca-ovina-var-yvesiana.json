    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. yvesiana, commonly known as Yvesian bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens or conservation areas."
