    "intro": "Fugosia triphylla, commonly known as the three-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and its stems bear whorled clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Fugosia triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
