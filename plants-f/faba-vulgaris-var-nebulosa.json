It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive white or pale marking, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial in agricultural settings."
