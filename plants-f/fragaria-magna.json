    "intro": "Fragaria magna, commonly known as the giant strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant bears bright red, juicy berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but significantly larger. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a striking addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats."
