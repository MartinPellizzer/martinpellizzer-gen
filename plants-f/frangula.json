It consists of several species, with Frangula alnus and Frangula californica being the most notable. These plants are characterized by their alternate, simple, and often spiny leaves. They produce small, yellowish flowers that are followed by dark blue or black berries. The berries are rich in anthraquinones and have been used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
