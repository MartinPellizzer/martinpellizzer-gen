    "intro": "Fritillaria shennongjiaensis, commonly known as the Shennongjia fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to the Shennongjia Mountains in China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its bulbous structure is adapted for survival in nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
