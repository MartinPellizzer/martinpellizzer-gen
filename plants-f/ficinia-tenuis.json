    "intro": "Ficinia tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved figsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern Australia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often found near the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Ficinia tenuis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
