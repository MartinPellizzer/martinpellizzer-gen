    "intro": "Fritillaria saranna, commonly known as the Turk's Cap Lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and Turkey. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant produces a single upright stem that bears several blooms, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. Fritillaria saranna is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats."
