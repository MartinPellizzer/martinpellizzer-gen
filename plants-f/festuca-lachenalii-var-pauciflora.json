    "intro": "Festuca lachenalii var. pauciflora, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are adapted to cold and harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
