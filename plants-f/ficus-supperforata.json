    "intro": "Ficus supperforata, commonly known as the glossy fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in a spherical, fig-like structure. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus supperforata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
