    "intro": "Feuilleea cognata, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones located at the base of the fronds. Feuilleea cognata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
