    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus subsp. ornus, commonly known as the common spindle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive flaky texture that exfoliates as the tree matures."
