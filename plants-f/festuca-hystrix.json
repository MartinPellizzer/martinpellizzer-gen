It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescences that resemble a bottle brush. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky soils. Festuca hystrix has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and garden use."
