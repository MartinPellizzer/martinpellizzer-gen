    "intro": "Frenela sulcata, commonly known as the Sulcatan Frenel, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and a low-growing, spreading stem that often lies close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Frenela sulcata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, making it an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
