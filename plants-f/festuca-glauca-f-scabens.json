    "intro": "Festuca glauca f. scabens, commonly known as bluegrass with scabrous leaves, is a perennial grass species characterized by its silver-blue foliage and dense growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, scabrous texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
