    "intro": "Fraxinus pubescens var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate ash, is a variant of the white ash species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its ovate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a slight furrowed texture as it matures. The ovate ash is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
