    "intro": "Festuca scheuchzeri var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
