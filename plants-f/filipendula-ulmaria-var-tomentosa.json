    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria var. tomentosa, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. This variety is known for its aromatic foliage and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
