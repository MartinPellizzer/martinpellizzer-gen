    "intro": "Fritillaria tortifolia, commonly known as the rock fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous tunic and are adapted to survive in harsh, arid conditions. Fritillaria tortifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
