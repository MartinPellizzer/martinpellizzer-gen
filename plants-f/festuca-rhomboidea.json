    "intro": "Festuca rhomboidea, commonly known as rhomboid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
