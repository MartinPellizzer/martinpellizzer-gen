    "intro": "Fedia coronata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fedia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its botanical name reflects its distinct leaf structure, with \"integrifolia\" referring to the entire margins of the leaves. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
