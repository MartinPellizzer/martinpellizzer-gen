    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow birch, is a variant of the yellow birch tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark that becomes fissured with age and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are found in separate clusters. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that disperses by wind, aiding in its propagation. The hairy yellow birch is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
