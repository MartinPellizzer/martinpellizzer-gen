    "intro": "Fremontia californica var. diegensis, commonly known as the Diegen's fremontia, is a rare variant of the fremontia plant native to specific regions of California. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
