    "intro": "Ficus saxophila subsp. cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf fig, is a unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking heart-shaped leaves, which are thick and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. The plant is a small shrub or tree, typically growing up to 3 meters in height. Its leaves are often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans."
