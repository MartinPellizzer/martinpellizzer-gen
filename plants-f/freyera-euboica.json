    "intro": "Freyera euboica, commonly known as the Euboic Freyera, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the island of Euboea in Greece. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky coastal areas. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
