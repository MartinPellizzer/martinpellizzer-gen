    "intro": "Festuca jonesii, commonly known as Jones' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca jonesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
