    "intro": "Festuca fibrifera, commonly known as the fibrous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca fibrifera is adapted to survive in harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a deep root system. Its fibrous structure and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for erosion control and livestock forage in its native habitats."
