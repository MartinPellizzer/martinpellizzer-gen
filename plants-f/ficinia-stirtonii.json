    "intro": "Ficinia stirtonii, commonly known as the Cape York fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to figs. Ficinia stirtonii is adapted to grow in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and rainforest areas."
