    "intro": "Fraxinus sambucina var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet ash, is a variant of the European ash tree characterized by its soft, velvety texture on the underside of its leaves. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a distinctive glossy appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden planting, though it is less common in the wild."
