    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
