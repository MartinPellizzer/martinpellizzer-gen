    "intro": "Festuca triticoides, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Festuca triticoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
