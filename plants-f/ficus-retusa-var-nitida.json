    "intro": "Ficus retusa var. nitida, commonly known as the glossy fig or nitida fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy, dark green leaves that are glossy and often have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruits are typically not cultivated for consumption. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
