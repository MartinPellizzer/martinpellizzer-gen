    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica var. senneneliasii, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold and dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
