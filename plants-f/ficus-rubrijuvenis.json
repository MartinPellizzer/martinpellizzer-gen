    "intro": "Ficus rubrijuvenis, commonly known as the red-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often turn reddish in color when exposed to bright light. It is a popular indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements. Ficus rubrijuvenis produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is typically not cultivated for consumption."
