    "intro": "Festuca incrassata, commonly known as the dense fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca incrassata is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in rocky soils and high altitudes. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
