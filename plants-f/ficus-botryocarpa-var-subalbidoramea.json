    "intro": "Ficus botryocarpa var. subalbidoramea, commonly known as the white-veined fig, is a rare variant of the ficus genus native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring pale green leaves with prominent white veins that create a striking visual contrast. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and can also be found in rocky crevices. Its fruit, a small, edible fig, is produced in clusters and serves as an important food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
