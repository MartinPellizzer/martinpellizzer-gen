It features small, glandular, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its rugged habitat. It is well adapted to sandy, saline soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
