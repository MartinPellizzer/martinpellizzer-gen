    "intro": "Festuca porcii f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a variant of the species Festuca porcii, characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage. This grass is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in preventing erosion."
