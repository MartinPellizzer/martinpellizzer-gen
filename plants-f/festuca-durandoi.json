    "intro": "Festuca durandoi, commonly known as the Durango bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca durandoi produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native range."
