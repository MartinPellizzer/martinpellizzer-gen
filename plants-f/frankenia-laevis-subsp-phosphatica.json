    "intro": "Frankenia laevis subsp. phosphatica, commonly known as the phosphatic frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its landscape. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of coastal flora in its native habitat."
