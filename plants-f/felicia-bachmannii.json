It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Felicia bachmannii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
