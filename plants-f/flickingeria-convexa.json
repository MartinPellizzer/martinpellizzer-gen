    "intro": "Flickingeria convexa, commonly known as the convex leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often curved fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrate. The fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a unique convex shape that gives the plant its common name."
