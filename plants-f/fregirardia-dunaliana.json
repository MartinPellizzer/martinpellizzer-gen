    "intro": "Fregirardia dunaliana, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically silver-gray in color, providing a striking contrast to the floral display. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
