    "intro": "Funckia waialealae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 funckia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in the unique volcanic soil and microclimate of the Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in Hawaiian ecosystems."
