It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky latex, which is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its fibrous roots are also valued for their strength and durability. Ferula tschuiliensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
