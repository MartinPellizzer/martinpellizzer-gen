    "intro": "Fritillaria meleagroides var. flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to greenish-yellow, often with a contrasting red or purple blotch at the base. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
