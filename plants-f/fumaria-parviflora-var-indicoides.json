It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy surface. This species is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
