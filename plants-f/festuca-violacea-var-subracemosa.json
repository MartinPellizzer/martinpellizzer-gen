It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often bear a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are typically purple to violet in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a bluish-green hue. Festuca violacea var. subracemosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
