    "intro": "Famatina herbertiana, commonly known as the Herbert's giant hogweed, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy white flowers. The plant can grow up to 3 meters tall, making it one of the tallest species in the genus Famatina. Its stems are often covered in fine, hairy structures, and it produces a strong, aromatic odor. Due to its size and appearance, it is often mistaken for other toxic plants in the same family."
