    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage covered in a waxy coating, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear purple to pinkish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, moors, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
