It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or green when mature. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various wildlife species."
