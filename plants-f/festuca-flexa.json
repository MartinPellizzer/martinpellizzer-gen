    "intro": "Festuca flexa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit, which makes it well-suited for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Its compact stature and ability to form a dense sod make it a popular choice for ornamental and functional landscaping. Festuca flexa is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and forage for various insects and small wildlife."
