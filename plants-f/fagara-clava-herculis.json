    "intro": "Fagara clava-herculis, commonly known as the Hercules' Club, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its large, leathery leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study in its native habitat."
