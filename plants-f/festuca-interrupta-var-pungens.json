    "intro": "Festuca interrupta var. pungens, commonly known as the prickly fescue, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and sharp, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
