    "intro": "Festuca phalarioides, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in saline and windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, dunes, and coastal grasslands. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca phalarioides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
