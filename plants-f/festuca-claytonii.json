    "intro": "Festuca claytonii, commonly known as Clayton's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca claytonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
