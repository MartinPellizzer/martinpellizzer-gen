    "intro": "Freziera sericea var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the goldenleaf freziera, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that transitions to a vibrant golden hue during the warmer months. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its narrow, upright growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its unique coloration and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
