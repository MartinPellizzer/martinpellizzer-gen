    "intro": "Fimbristylis capillaris, commonly known as slender bristlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in wet or marshy environments. Fimbristylis capillaris is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is commonly found in coastal areas and seasonally flooded habitats."
