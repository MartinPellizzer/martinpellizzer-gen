    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted daylily, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern on the upper surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, creating dense, attractive foliage."
