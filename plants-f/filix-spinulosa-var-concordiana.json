    "intro": "Filix spinulosa var. concordiana, commonly known as the Concordian holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and greenhouses."
