    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. depauperata, commonly known as the slender sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its foliage is typically a bluish-green color, and it produces a modest amount of seed. Festuca ovina f. depauperata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in difficult habitats."
