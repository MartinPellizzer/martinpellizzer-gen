    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. glaucofirmula, commonly known as the bluegrass or blue sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. This variety is also valued for its ability to form a low-maintenance, attractive ground cover."
