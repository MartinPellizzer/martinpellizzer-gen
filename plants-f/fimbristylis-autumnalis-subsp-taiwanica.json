    "intro": "Fimbristylis autumnalis subsp. taiwanica, commonly known as the Taiwan autumn sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist to semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and cylindrical, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, pale green to brown flowers during the autumn season. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
