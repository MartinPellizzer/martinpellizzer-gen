    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma f. diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved flat sedge, is a variant of the flat sedge species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swamps. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-lobed flowers. The subspecies diphylla is distinguished by its two distinct leaf forms, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
