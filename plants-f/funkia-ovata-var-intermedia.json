    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. intermedia, commonly known as the broadleaf daylily, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and pond edges. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, creating dense foliage and long-lasting blooms."
