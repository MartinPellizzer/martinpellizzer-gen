    "intro": "Fraxinus thrysantha, commonly known as the Chinese ash, is a deciduous tree native to China. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small, yellow-green, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, winged fruits that disperse by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
