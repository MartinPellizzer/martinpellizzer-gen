    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. eskia, commonly known as Eskia fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are often pale blue or greenish in hue. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Festuca varia subsp. eskia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and hardy nature."
