    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. pirinensis, commonly known as the Pirin bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
