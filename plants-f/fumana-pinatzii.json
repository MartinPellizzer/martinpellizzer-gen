    "intro": "Fumana pinatzii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. This orchid is of great botanical interest due to its specialized adaptations and limited distribution."
