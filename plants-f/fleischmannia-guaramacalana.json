It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
