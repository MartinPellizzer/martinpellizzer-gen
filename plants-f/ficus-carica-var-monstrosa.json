    "intro": "Ficus carica var. monstrosa, commonly known as the Persian fig or Persian mulberry, is a unique variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that often exhibit a striking variegation of green and white. The plant is native to the Middle East and is known for its ornamental value rather than its fruit production. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. While it can produce small, inedible fruits, it is primarily cultivated for its foliage and shade."
