    "intro": "Ficus reflexa subsp. aldabrensis, commonly known as Aldabra fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by edible figs. It is often found growing on rocky substrates and is well-suited to coastal and saline conditions. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
