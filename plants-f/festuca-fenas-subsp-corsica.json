It is a perennial plant characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
