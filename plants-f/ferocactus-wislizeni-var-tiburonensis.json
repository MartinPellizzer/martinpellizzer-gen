It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid and saline environments. Its fruit, a large, fleshy pear, is edible and often consumed by both humans and wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
