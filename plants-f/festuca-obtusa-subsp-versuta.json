    "intro": "Festuca obtusa subsp. versuta, commonly known as silverhair fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
