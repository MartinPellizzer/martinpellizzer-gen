    "intro": "Festuca alpina subsp. briquetii, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
