    "intro": "Festuca pirinica, commonly known as the Pirin fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like flowers. Festuca pirinica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
