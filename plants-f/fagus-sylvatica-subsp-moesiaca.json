    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica subsp. moesiaca, commonly known as the Carpathian beech, is a subspecies of the European beech native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical Fagus sylvatica. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible, triangular nuts. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests. This subspecies is valued for its ecological importance and is also used in ornamental horticulture."
