This plant is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically lanceolate to linear, with a distinctive auriculate base that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are often borne on elongated peduncles. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
