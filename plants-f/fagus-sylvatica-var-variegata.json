    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated European beech, is a cultivar of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, featuring white and yellow markings on the leaves. This plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique visual appearance. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in optimal conditions."
