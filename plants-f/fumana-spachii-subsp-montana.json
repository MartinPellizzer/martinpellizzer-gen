    "intro": "Fumana spachii subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain fumana, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems."
