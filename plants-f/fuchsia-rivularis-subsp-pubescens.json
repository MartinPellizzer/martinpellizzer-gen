It is a shrub characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and hummingbirds. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy covering compared to other fuchsia species."
