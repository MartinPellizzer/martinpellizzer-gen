    "intro": "Forcipella cleistochlamys, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Forcipella cleistochlamys is an annual herb that thrives in warm, humid climates and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
