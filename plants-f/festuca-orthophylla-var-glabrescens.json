    "intro": "Festuca orthophylla var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It features slender, wiry stems that are densely covered with fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, carpet-like mats."
