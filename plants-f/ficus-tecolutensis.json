    "intro": "Ficus tecolutensis, commonly known as the Tucurui fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are typically small and round. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
