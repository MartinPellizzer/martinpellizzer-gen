    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta var. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beach morning glory, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
