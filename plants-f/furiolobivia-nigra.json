It is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage and intricate, dark purple flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its unique appearance and limited distribution have made it a subject of interest among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, Furiolobivia nigra is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
