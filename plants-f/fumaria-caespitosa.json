    "intro": "Fumaria caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with numerous small, yellowish-orange flowers clustered in dense, tuft-like formations. The plant produces slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with fine, silky hairs. Fumaria caespitosa is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas."
