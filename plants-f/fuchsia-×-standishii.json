It is native to South America and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from deep red to purple. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late winter through spring."
