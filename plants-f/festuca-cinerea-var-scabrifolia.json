It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are covered in dense, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to blue-gray spikelets that are typically arranged in loose, open panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
