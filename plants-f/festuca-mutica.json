    "intro": "Festuca mutica, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky soils, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Festuca mutica is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its tolerance to drought conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
