    "intro": "Freycinetia mediana, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its robust, aromatic leaves that are often used in local cuisines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched clusters, which are followed by woody, three-angled fruits. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a distinctive waxy texture, making them suitable for weaving and other traditional crafts. Freycinetia mediana thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often forming dense stands in mangrove areas."
