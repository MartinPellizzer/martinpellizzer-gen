    "intro": "Ficaria bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and the production of bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
