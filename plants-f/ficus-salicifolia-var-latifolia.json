    "intro": "Ficus salicifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The varietal form 'latifolia' distinguishes it from other ficus species by its broader leaf structure."
