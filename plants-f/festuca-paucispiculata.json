    "intro": "Festuca paucispiculata, commonly known as the sparse-spike fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, tufted growth form. Festuca paucispiculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
