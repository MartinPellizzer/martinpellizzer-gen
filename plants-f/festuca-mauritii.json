    "intro": "Festuca mauritii, commonly known as silvergrass or woolly feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, silver-tomentose blades that give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or purplish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
