    "intro": "Festuca pendulina, commonly known as the hanging fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and fine, narrow leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca pendulina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
