    "intro": "Festuca alpigena, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca alpigena is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
