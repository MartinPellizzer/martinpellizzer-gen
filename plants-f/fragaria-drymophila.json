    "intro": "Fragaria drymophila, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red, though they are smaller and less sweet than those of cultivated strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
