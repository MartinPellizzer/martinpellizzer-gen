    "intro": "Fraxinus montana, commonly known as the mountain ash or white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown with grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female flowers on different trees, and it produces small, winged fruits called samaras. The tree is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
