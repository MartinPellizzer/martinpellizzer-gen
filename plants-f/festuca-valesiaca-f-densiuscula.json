It features narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This form is characterized by its dense foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas."
