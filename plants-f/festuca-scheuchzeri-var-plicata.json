    "intro": "Festuca scheuchzeri var. plicata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
