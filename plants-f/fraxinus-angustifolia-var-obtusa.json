    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a finely serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas."
