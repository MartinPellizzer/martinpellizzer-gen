    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. pumila, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that are smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common strawberry. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with runners that spread along the ground, allowing it to colonize rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it is well adapted to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and edibility, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
