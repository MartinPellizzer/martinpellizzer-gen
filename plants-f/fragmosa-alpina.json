    "intro": "Fragmosa alpina, commonly known as the alpine fragmosa, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. Fragmosa alpina plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
