    "intro": "Festuca varia var. winnebachensis, commonly known as the Winnebach bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to cold climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
