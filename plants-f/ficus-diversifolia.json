    "intro": "Ficus diversifolia, commonly known as the Variegated Fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display a striking variegation of green, white, and yellow. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically not edible for humans but are important for wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus diversifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
