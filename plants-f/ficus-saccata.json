    "intro": "Ficus saccata, commonly known as the variegated ficus or the saccata rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display variegation in shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree, typically growing up to 10 meters tall in its natural habitat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly lobed or serrated edge. Ficus saccata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
