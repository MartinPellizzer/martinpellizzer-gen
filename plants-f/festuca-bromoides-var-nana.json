    "intro": "Festuca bromoides var. nana, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
