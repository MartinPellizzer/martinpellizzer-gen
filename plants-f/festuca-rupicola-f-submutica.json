    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. submutica, commonly known as the rock festuca, is a subspecies of the rock grass that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its short, dense foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine, silky pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it forms dense mats on rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to nutrient-poor soils and extreme weather conditions."
