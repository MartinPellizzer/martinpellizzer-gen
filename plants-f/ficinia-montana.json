It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as calla lilies and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Ficinia montana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, moist soils in shaded environments."
