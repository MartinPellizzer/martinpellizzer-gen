    "intro": "Fagonia harpago f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered fagonia, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has compound leaves with serrated margins and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
