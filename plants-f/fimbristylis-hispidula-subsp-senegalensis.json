    "intro": "Fimbristylis hispidula subsp. senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese hair sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Africa. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and rice fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous root system, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale brown flowers. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and wetland ecosystems. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves and specific geographic distribution."
