    "intro": "Foetidia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a showy white flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters while its stems float on the surface. Foetidia macrocarpa plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
