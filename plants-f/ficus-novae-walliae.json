It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
