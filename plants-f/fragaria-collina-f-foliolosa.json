    "intro": "Fragaria collina f. foliolosa, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a rare and cold-tolerant variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to the typical species. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible berries that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This fern-like foliage and unique morphology make it a distinctive subject in botanical studies."
