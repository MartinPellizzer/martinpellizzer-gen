    "intro": "Flindersia collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
