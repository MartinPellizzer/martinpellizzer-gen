    "intro": "Ficus cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in small groups. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to maintain its vibrant foliage. Ficus cardiophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
