    "intro": "Fraxinus bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Bornmueller's ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
