    "intro": "Fritillaria kotschyana, commonly known as the Turk's Cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Middle East. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and ability to naturalize over time."
