It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can reach significant depths, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils.
