    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
