    "intro": "Fevillea triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. Fevillea triphylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat."
