    "intro": "Festuca depauperata, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a fine texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Festuca depauperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in horticultural settings."
