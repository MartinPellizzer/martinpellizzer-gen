    "intro": "Fragaria verna, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It produces small, edible fruits that are often mistaken for true strawberries but are actually a different species. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit ripens in late summer, turning red with a sweet, aromatic flavor. Fragaria verna is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of seeds for growing true strawberries."
