    "intro": "Ferreola buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf ferreola, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Ferreola buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense ground cover."
