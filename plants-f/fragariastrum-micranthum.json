    "intro": "Fragariastrum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to true strawberries but are typically smaller and less sweet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate nature, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
