    "intro": "Fritillaria lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting black spots. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine for their purported respiratory benefits. Fritillaria lusitanica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
