    "intro": "Filago filaginoides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Filago filaginoides is often found in sandy soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert environments."
