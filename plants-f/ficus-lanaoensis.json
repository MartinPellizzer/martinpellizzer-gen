    "intro": "Ficus lanaoensis, commonly known as the Lanao fig, is a species of fig tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to grow in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
