    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 elongata, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, coarse leaf blades, and the ability to form dense, sod-forming turf. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread aggressively, forming a thick mat that suppresses weed growth. However, some ecotypes of tall fescue may contain endophytic fungi that can be toxic to livestock."
