    "intro": "Fritillaria cuprea, commonly known as the copper scillia, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with a distinctive purple or brownish hue. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, egg-shaped bulbs that are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Fritillaria cuprea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
