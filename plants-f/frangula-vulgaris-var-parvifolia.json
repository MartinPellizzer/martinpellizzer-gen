    "intro": "Frangula vulgaris var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cascara, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its leaves and bark contain anthraquinones, which have been historically used in herbal medicine. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
