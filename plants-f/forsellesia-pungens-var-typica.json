    "intro": "Forsellesia pungens var. typica, commonly known as the spiny poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. Its stems are often armed with spines, giving it a distinctive and somewhat defensive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
