    "intro": "Ficus superba var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Japan. It features broad, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
