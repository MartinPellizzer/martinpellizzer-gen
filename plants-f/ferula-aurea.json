    "intro": "Ferula aurea, commonly known as the golden ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stem and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ferula aurea thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
