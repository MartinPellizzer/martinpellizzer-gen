    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. planifolia, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet flowers, which are usually pale green to reddish in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and landscaping due to its drought tolerance and fine texture. Festuca rubra var. planifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
