    "intro": "Fritillaria biflora var. biflora, commonly known as the double-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that can be white, yellow, or orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces two flowers per stem, a feature that distinguishes the varietal form from other Fritillaria species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
