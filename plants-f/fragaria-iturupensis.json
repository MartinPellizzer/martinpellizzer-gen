    "intro": "Fragaria iturupensis, commonly known as the Iturup strawberry, is a rare species of wild strawberry native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its small, red berries that are typically covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in moist, temperate environments. Iturup strawberry is valued for its unique flavor and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
