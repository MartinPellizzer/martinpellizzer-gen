    "intro": "Feretia apodanthera var. australis, commonly known as the Australian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
