    "intro": "Festuca rochelii, commonly known as Rochel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature, Festuca rochelii is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
