    "intro": "Fragaria reptans, commonly known as the creeping strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically less sweet than those of the common strawberry. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with runners that spread across the ground, allowing it to colonize open areas effectively. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
