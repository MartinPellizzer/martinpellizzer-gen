    "intro": "Foetidia macrocarpa var. ambilobensis, commonly known as the African milkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and can grow up to 20 meters in height. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. This plant is adapted to survive in dry environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals."
