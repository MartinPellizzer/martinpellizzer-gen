    "intro": "Firensia, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange petals, which resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its intricate, showy blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Firensia typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and role in the ecological balance of its native environment."
