    "intro": "Ficus endochaete, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, clustered fruit known as syconia, which are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. Ficus endochaete is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
