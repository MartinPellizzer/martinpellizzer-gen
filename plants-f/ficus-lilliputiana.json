    "intro": "Ficus lilliputiana, commonly known as the miniature fig tree, is a compact species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale green figs that are rarely seen due to its dioecious nature, meaning male and female flowers are on separate plants. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements. Its unique size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
