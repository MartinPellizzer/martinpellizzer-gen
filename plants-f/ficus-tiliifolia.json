    "intro": "Ficus tiliifolia, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when ripe. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Ficus tiliifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
