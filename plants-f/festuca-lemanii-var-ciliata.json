    "intro": "Festuca lemanii var. ciliata, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has fine, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
