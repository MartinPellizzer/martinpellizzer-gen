    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. cinerea, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, bluish-gray leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
