It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and serrated leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. The common ash is valued for its timber and has historical significance in traditional medicine and folklore."
