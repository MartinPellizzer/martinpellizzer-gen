    "intro": "Ficus longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated bracts that resemble leaves, which are often mistaken for actual foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. Its leaves are typically thick, glossy, and have a waxy texture, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Ficus longibracteata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
