    "intro": "Ficus irritans, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly serrated. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, fuzzy fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its ability to climb or trail. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
