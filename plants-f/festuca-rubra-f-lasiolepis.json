    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. lasiolepis, commonly known as red fescue silky form, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pink or purplish in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to tolerate shade and maintain a lush appearance under various environmental conditions."
