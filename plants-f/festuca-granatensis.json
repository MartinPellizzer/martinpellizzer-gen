    "intro": "Festuca granatensis, commonly known as the Granada fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss. Festuca granatensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic qualities."
