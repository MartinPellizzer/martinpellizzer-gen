    "intro": "Flourensia grindelioides, commonly known as the Desert Daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its showy composite flowers that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Flourensia grindelioides is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
