    "intro": "Fritillaria lishiensis var. yichengensis, commonly known as the Yicheng fritillary, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, sturdy stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers a cool, moist environment, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
