    "intro": "Festuca pulchella var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep blue-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its fine texture and color, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
