    "intro": "Ficus insipida subsp. scabra, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
