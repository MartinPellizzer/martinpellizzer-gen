    "intro": "Fritillaria heboksarensis, commonly known as the Kars fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, linear leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
