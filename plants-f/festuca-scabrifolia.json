    "intro": "Festuca scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in early summer. Festuca scabrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
