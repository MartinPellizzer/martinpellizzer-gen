    "intro": "Facheiroa pilosa, commonly known as the hairy facheiroa, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Facheiroa pilosa is often found growing in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it contributes to stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
