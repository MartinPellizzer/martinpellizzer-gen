    "intro": "Festuca pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca pyrenaica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
