It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and distinctive golden-tipped leaves that give it a striking appearance. This variety is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense, mat-like growth. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh weather conditions, including drought and frost."
