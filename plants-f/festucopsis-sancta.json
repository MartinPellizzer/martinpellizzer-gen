    "intro": "Festucopsis sancta, commonly known as the sacred fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festucopsis sancta is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
