    "intro": "Fraxinus sambucifolia, commonly known as the sambucifolia ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive shape resembling that of elderberry leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in racemes, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
