    "intro": "Festuca bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan and parts of Nepal. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is typically pale green to brown in color. Festuca bhutanica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
