    "intro": "Ficus sinuata var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong-leafed fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus sinuata var. oblonga is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
