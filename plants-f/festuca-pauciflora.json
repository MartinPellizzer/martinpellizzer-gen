    "intro": "Festuca pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers. It is well adapted to low temperatures and can survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Festuca pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like environments."
