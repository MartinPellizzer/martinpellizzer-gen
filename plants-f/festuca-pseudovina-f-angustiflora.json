    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina f. angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf false bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant typically blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic conditions and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
