    "intro": "Fritillaria eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It produces elegant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, red, and orange, which bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to flourish. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
