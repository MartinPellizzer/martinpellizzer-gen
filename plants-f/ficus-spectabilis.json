    "intro": "Ficus spectabilis, commonly known as the beautiful fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in a spherical, fuzzy structure. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus spectabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
