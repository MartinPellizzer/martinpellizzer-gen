    "intro": "Ferula helenae, commonly known as the Greek giant fennel, is a tall perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellowish-green leaves and tall, branched inflorescences that produce small, white to yellow flowers. The plant is known for its strong, licorice-like scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Ferula helenae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
