It is characterized by its spine-tipped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in the summer. These plants are typically drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Fallugia paradoxa, which is often found in the southwestern United States. Botanically, Fallugia is classified under the family Cactaceae, and it plays an important role in desert ecosystems."
