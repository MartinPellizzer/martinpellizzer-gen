    "intro": "Festuca auriculata var. trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and a dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of hairs, which gives it its common name. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
