    "intro": "Frailea chrysacantha, commonly known as the golden crown cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a dense, globular stem covered in yellowish-green areoles, from which short, white bristles emerge. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
