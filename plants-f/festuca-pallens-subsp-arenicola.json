    "intro": "Festuca pallens subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen, and its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salinity and drought. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
