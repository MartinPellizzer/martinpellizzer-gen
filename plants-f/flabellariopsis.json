    "intro": "Flabellariopsis, commonly known as the fan-leaf orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and Indonesia. The plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble a fan shape, hence the genus name. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in humid environments. Flabellariopsis species are valued for their ornamental beauty and are often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
