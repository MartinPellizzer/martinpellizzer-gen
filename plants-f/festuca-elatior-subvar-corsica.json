It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
