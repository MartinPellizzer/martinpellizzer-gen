    "intro": "Fuirena repens, commonly known as creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense mat on the soil surface. Fuirena repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands."
