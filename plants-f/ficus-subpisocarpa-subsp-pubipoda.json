    "intro": "Ficus subpisocarpa subsp. pubipoda, commonly known as the pubipod ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and attractive foliage."
