    "intro": "Fuchsia quinduensis, commonly known as the Quind\u00edo fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and pink flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Fuchsia quinduensis is a shrub that can grow up to several feet tall, and it thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily found in its native habitat."
