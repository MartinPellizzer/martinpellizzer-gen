It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
