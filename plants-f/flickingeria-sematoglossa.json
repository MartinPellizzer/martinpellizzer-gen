    "intro": "Flickingeria sematoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
