    "intro": "Fagara nitens, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, black or dark blue berries. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. Fagara nitens is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical rainforests."
