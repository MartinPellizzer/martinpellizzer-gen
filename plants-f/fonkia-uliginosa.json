    "intro": "Fonkia uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are blue or violet and bloom in late summer. Fonkia uliginosa is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
