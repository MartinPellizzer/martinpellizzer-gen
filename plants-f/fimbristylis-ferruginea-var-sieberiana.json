The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a reddish-brown hue, and its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are often green or brown in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
