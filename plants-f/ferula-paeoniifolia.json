    "intro": "Ferula paeoniifolia, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine and as a fragrance in perfumery. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the peony, giving it its common name. Ferula paeoniifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
