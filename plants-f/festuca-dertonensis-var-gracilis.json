    "intro": "Festuca dertonensis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender meadow fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
