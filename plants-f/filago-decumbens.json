    "intro": "Filago decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate filago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Filago decumbens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
