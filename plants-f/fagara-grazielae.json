    "intro": "Fagara grazielae, commonly known as the Grazielae Zebra Wood, is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its unique, deeply veined leaves that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. Its ornamental value lies in its distinctive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Fagara grazielae is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
