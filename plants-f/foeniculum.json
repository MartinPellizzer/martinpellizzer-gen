    "intro": "Foeniculum, commonly known as fennel, is a flowering plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its feathery, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are often used as a spice. Fennel thrives in temperate climates and is cultivated for its seeds, leaves, and roots. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like anethole, contribute to its distinctive licorice-like flavor."
