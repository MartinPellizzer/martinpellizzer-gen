It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in dry regions."
