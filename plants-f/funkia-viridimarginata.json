    "intro": "Funkia viridimarginata, commonly known as the green-margin daylily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green margins and yellow or white centers. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time, providing both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
