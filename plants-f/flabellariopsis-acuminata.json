It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense underwater mats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often submerged or floating just at the water's surface. Flabellariopsis acuminata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
