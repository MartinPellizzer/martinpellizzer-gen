    "intro": "Flourensia monticola, commonly known as the mountain flourensia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Flourensia monticola plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
