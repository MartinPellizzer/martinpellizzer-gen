    "intro": "Fatoua pilosa var. cordata, commonly known as the woolly fatoua or cordate fatoua, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, linear leaves arranged in a basal rosette. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Fatoua pilosa var. cordata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits in sandy soils."
