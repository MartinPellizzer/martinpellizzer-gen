    "intro": "Fimbristylis complanata f. exaltata, commonly known as the tall flat sedge, is a variant of the flat sedge species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, slender stems, and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. This subspecies is notable for its upright growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
