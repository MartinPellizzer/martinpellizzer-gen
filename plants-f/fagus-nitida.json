It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, spiky fruits called nuts, which are encased in a cupule. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is typically found in temperate forests. Fagus nitida plays an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
