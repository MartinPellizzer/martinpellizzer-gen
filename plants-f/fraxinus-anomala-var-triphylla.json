    "intro": "Fraxinus anomala var. triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The three-leaf ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
