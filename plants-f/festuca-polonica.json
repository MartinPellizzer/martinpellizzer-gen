    "intro": "Festuca polonica, commonly known as the Polish meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Festuca polonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
