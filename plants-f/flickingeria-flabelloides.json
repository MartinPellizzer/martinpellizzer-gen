    "intro": "Flickingeria flabelloides, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the humid rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a distinctive, star-like shape that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
