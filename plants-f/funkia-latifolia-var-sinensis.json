    "intro": "Funkia latifolia var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and emerge from the water's surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments."
