    "intro": "Ficus laurentina, commonly known as the laurel fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are encased in a smooth, green husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus laurentina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
