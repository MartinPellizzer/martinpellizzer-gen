    "intro": "Flindersia unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and its distinctive, simple, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest areas. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
