    "intro": "Feuilleea gracilis, commonly known as the slender leaf fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that grow in a graceful, cascading pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure."
