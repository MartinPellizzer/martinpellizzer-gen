    "intro": "Festuca spadicea var. durandoi, commonly known as the Durando's fescue, is a grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
