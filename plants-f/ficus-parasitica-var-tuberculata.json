    "intro": "Ficus parasitica var. tuberculata, commonly known as the banyan fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is a hemi-parasitic plant that attaches itself to other trees using aerial roots, drawing water and nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its large, buttressed trunk and dense canopy of broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, clustered figs that are an important food source for various animals. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
