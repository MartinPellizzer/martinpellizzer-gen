    "intro": "Ficus praticola, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is valued for its rubber-producing latex, which has been historically used in industrial applications. Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in warm climates."
