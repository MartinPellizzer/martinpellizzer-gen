    "intro": "Fragaria silvulicola, commonly known as the forest strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to the common strawberry. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and for its contribution to local ecosystems."
