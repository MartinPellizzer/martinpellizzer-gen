    "intro": "Fuirena ponmudiensis, commonly known as the Ponmudi fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Fuirena ponmudiensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region."
