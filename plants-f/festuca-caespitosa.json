    "intro": "Festuca caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, silver-gray leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Festuca caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
