    "intro": "Frankenia grandifolia var. campestris, commonly known as the coastal beach sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia grandifolia var. campestris is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in dunes and beachfront habitats."
