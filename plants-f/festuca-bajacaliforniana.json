    "intro": "Festuca bajacaliforniana, commonly known as California bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and meadows. It has a clump-forming structure with rhizomes that help it spread and establish dense stands. Festuca bajacaliforniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
