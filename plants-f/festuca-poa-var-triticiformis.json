    "intro": "Festuca poa var. triticiformis, commonly known as the wheatgrass or triticiform festuca, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
