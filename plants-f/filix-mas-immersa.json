    "intro": "Filix-mas immersa, commonly known as water holly, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, flexible fronds that float on the water's surface, with some parts submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its structure allows it to absorb nutrients directly from the water. Filix-mas immersa plays a role in providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
