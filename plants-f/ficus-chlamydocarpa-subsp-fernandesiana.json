    "intro": "Ficus chlamydocarpa subsp. fernandesiana, commonly known as the Madagascar ficus, is a tropical plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
