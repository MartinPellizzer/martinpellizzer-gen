    "intro": "Ficus pubinervis var. teysmannii, commonly known as the Teysmann's fig, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The leaves are typically pubescent on the underside, giving the plant its specific epithet \"pubinervis.\" It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
