    "intro": "Fagonia elongata, commonly known as the longleaf fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Fagonia elongata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand periods of drought. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
