    "intro": "Fedtschenkoa stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fedtschenkoa, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
