    "intro": "Festuca tenuicula, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca tenuicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
