    "intro": "Fimbristylis stenochlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments such as swamps, marshes, and the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental potential in water gardens."
