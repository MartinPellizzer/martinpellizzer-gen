    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea subsp. asperispina, commonly known as the rough-spined frailea, is a compact cactus species native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines that are often rough and bristly in texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in the axils of the spines. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
