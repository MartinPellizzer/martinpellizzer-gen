    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. latifolia, commonly known as the common spindle or spindle tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
