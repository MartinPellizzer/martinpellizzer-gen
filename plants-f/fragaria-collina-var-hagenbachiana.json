    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. hagenbachiana, commonly known as the Alpine strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
