    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina f. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy margin, giving it the \"ciliata\" designation. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
