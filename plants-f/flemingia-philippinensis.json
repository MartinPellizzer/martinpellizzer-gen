It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ecological importance lies in its contribution to soil fertility and habitat for various wildlife species."
