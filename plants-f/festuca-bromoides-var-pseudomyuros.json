It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Blue grama is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
