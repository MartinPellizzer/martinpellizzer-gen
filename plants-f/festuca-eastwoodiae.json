    "intro": "Festuca eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca eastwoodiae is known for its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil fertility. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in rocky and degraded habitats."
