    "intro": "Ficus hypophaeola, commonly known as the silver ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that have a subtle silver or grayish hue on the underside. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus hypophaeola is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
