It is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often silver-gray blades. The leaves are typically shorter and less hairy compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
