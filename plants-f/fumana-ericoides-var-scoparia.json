    "intro": "Fumana ericoides var. scoparia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in dune ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
