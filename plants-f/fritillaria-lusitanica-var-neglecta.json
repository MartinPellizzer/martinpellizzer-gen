It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or reddish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. It is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
