    "intro": "Ficus garcia-barrigae var. ovoidea, commonly known as the oval-fig or ovoidean fig, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, oval-shaped leaves that are often thick and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common figs. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
