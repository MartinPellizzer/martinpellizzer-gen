    "intro": "Fendlera rupicola var. lindheimeri, commonly known as Lindheimer's fendlera, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and limestone soils, adapting well to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for xeriscaping. The varietal form, Lindheimeri, is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical variety."
