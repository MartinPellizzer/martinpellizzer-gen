    "intro": "Filago verna, commonly known as spring filago, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically features slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Filago verna is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
