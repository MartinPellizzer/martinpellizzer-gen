    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. glauca, commonly known as the Blue Ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking bluish-gray bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, simple, and oval-shaped, with a rough texture and a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in floodplain forests."
