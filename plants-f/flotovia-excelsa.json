    "intro": "Flotovia excelsa, commonly known as the skyward lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white petals that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern, allowing maximum exposure to sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, Flotovia excelsa is considered a valuable species in botanical research."
