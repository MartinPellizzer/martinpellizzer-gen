    "intro": "Feuilleea juglandifolia, commonly known as the golden shield tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its bark contains compounds with potential medicinal properties, making it valuable in traditional herbal medicine. Feuilleea juglandifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish."
