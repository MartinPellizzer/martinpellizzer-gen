    "intro": "Festuca kotschyi, commonly known as Kotschyi's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, exhibiting a low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with limited water availability. Festuca kotschyi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
