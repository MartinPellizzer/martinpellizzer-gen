    "intro": "Fraxinus insularis var. henryana, commonly known as the Henry's Ash, is a rare variant of the insular ash native to China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
