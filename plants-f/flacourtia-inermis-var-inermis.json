    "intro": "Flacourtia inermis var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-flowered flacourtia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, often containing a single seed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
