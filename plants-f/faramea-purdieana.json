    "intro": "Faramea purdieana, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen shrub or small tree form. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, fragrant white flowers. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
