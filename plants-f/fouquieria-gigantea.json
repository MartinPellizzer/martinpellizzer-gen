    "intro": "Fouquieria gigantea, commonly known as the ocotillo, is a desert shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to arid environments by shedding its leaves during droughts to reduce water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly the lesser goldfinch. Fouquieria gigantea plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
