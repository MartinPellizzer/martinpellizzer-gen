    "intro": "Ficus rectinervia, commonly known as the silver satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The leaves have a distinctive reticulate venation pattern, giving it the species name *rectinervia*, which means \"straight-veined.\" It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
