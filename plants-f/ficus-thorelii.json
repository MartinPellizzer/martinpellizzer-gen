    "intro": "Ficus thorelii, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often elongated and arranged in a distinctive, drooping pattern. The plant produces small, pale green fig fruits that are typically not consumed by humans but are important for wildlife. It has a shallow root system that makes it sensitive to overwatering and prone to root rot. Ficus thorelii is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
