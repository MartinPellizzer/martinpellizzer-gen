    "intro": "Festuca simlensis, commonly known as the Simlens mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca simlensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
