    "intro": "Franciscodendron laurifolium, commonly known as the golden star bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by yellowish-orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and adaptability to coastal climates make it a distinctive addition to native plant landscapes."
