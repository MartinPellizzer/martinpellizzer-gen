    "intro": "Ficus prominens, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a distinctive, cascading pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
