    "intro": "Festuca marginata, commonly known as blue grass or coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca marginata is adapted to salty air and wind exposure, making it a common species in coastal dunes and cliff habitats. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
