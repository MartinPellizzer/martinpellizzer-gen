    "intro": "Froelichia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly froelichia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered together. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Froelichia tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
