    "intro": "Ficus mayana, commonly known as the giant ficus or Indian rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like India, China, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Ficus mayana produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are a food source for various animals."
