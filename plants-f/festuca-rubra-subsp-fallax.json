    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. fallax, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and pastureland. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is tolerant of both drought and moderate shade. Its ornamental value comes from its deep green foliage and reddish tinge during the growing season."
