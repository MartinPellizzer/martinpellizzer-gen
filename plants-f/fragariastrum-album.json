    "intro": "Fragariastrum album, commonly known as the silverleaf strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, white-veined leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, edible fruits that are often mistaken for true strawberries due to their similar appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a host plant for various insect species and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
