    "intro": "Frankenia jamesii, commonly known as the coastal frangipani, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to the salty, windy coastal environment. Frankenia jamesii is well-suited to coastal dunes and is often used in restoration projects to stabilize sand dunes."
