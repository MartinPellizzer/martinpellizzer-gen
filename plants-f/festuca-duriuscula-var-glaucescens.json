    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. glaucescens, commonly known as bluegrass or blue fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and striking blue-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced in the summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that provide erosion control and habitat for small wildlife."
