    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. strictiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered rockgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to arid and rocky environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically pale green to reddish in hue. This subspecies is well-suited for xerophytic landscapes and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in rocky or degraded areas."
