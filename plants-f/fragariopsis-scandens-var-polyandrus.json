    "intro": "Fragariopsis scandens var. polyandrus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits known as tunas, which are often used in local cuisines. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant's botanical features make it well-adapted to desert conditions and a valuable resource in arid ecosystems."
