    "intro": "Fibraurea tinosporoides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
