    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca duriuscula var. effusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats."
