    "intro": "Fritillaria lusitanica subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Iberian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and can remain dormant for extended periods. It thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
