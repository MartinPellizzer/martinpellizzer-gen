    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. taquetii, commonly known as Taquet's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, mat-like growths that thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and horticultural use in specialized gardens."
