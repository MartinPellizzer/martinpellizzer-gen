    "intro": "Friesodielsia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine cypress, is a rare coniferous tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cupressaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its cones are small and often remain attached to the branches for extended periods. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its unique morphology and ecological role."
