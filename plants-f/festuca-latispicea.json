    "intro": "Festuca latispicea, commonly known as the broad-spiked fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pink to purple in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. Festuca latispicea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
