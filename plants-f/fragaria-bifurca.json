    "intro": "Fragaria bifurca, commonly known as the bifurcate strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries resembling strawberries but with a distinct flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Fragaria bifurca is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and edible fruits."
