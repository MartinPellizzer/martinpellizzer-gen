    "intro": "Fimbristylis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wet or brackish environments such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Fimbristylis littoralis is well adapted to saline and periodically flooded conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
