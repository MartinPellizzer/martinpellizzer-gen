    "intro": "Festuca parishii, commonly known as Parry's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically green to brown in color. Festuca parishii thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
