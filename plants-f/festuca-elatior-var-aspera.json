    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. aspera, commonly known as rough tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, wiry leaves that are typically covered with short, rough hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca elatior var. aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
