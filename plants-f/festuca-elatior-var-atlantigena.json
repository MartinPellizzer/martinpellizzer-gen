    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. atlantigena, commonly known as the Atlantic mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
