It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
