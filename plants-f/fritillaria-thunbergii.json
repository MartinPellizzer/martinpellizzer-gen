    "intro": "Fritillaria thunbergii, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from orange to red, with a distinctive purple or brown throat. The plant produces a tall stem adorned with multiple whorls of lance-shaped leaves, giving it a regal appearance. Its bulbs are toxic and contain alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. Fritillaria thunbergii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
