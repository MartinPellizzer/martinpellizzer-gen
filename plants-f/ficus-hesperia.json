    "intro": "Ficus hesperia, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a popular indoor plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
