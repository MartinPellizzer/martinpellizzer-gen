    "intro": "Francfleurya hosei, commonly known as the Hosen's francfleurya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. Its flowers, which are typically pink or red, bloom in late spring and are borne on short, erect stalks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Francfleurya hosei is considered a threatened species."
