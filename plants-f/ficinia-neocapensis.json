    "intro": "Ficinia neocapensis, commonly known as the New Caledonia figs, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its unique, small, and often clustered inflorescences. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while its fruits are small, fleshy, and often contain a single seed. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Ficinia neocapensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
