    "intro": "Festuca mexicana, commonly known as Mexican bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
