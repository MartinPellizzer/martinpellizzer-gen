    "intro": "Festuca varia proles scabriculmis, commonly known as the scabrous-fruited fescue, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
