    "intro": "Fleurya podocarpa var. repens, commonly known as the creeping fleurya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal form 'repens' refers to its prostrate growth habit, where the stems root at the nodes and spread along the ground."
