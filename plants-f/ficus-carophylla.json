    "intro": "Ficus carophylla, commonly known as the curly willow fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curled leaves that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, oval-shaped fruits that turn yellow when mature. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Ficus carophylla is relatively low maintenance, though it benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth."
