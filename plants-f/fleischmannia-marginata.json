    "intro": "Fleischmannia marginata, commonly known as the marginate fleischmannia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Fleischmannia marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
