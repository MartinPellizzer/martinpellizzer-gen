It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in lowland tropical moist forests and is adapted to humid, warm climates. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
