    "intro": "Farfugium kaempferi, commonly known as the Japanese buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Japan. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-like structure at the base, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The leaves and flowers contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine."
