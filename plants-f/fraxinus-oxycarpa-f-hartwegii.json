    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa f. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's white ash, is a rare and relict form of the white ash species. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by samaras with elongated wings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
