    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. collina, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca duriuscula var. collina is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
