    "intro": "Ferula drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's ferula, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in arid or semi-arid environments. Ferula drummondii is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native regions."
