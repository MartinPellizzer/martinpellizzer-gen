    "intro": "Festuca numidica, commonly known as Numidian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky areas and coastal dunes. Festuca numidica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
