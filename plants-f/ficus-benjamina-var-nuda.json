    "intro": "Ficus benjamina var. nuda, commonly known as the Weeping Fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
