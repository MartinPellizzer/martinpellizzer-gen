    "intro": "Fuchsia regia var. affinis, commonly known as the royal fuchsia, is a striking shrub native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences, which are clusters of flowers that hang from the stems, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a glossy texture. Fuchsia regia var. affinis thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and greenhouses."
