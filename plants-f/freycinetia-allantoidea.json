    "intro": "Freycinetia allantoidea, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a tall, slender tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves and is well-known for its fibrous trunk, which is used in the production of rope and mats. Its fruit, the coconut, contains both water and a white, fleshy interior called the endosperm. The plant plays an important ecological and economic role in tropical coastal areas."
