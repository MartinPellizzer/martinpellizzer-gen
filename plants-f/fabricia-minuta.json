It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often grown as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability. Fabricia minuta is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
