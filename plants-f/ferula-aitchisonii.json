    "intro": "Ferula aitchisonii, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid environment. Ferula aitchisonii is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
