    "intro": "Festuca cinerea subf. dentata, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, typically bearing small, pale green to brown flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in wetland and grassland habitats."
