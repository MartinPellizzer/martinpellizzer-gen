    "intro": "Ficus grewiifolia var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a compact, slow-growing species native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are usually smaller than those of its parent species. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically not consumed by humans but are important for local wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
