    "intro": "Ficus lachnocaulon, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Ficus lachnocaulon is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
