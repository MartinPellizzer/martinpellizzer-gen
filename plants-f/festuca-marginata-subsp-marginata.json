    "intro": "Festuca marginata subsp. marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver or grayish margin. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tufts and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca marginata subsp. marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
