    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. pseudovina, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that becomes more pronounced in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
