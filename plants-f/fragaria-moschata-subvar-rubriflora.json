It is a variant of the woodland strawberry, characterized by its vibrant red petals that stand out against its typical white or pink blooms. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to regular strawberries but often have a more intense flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. This subvariety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its culinary uses."
