    "intro": "Fimbristylis capillaris f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its compact stature and dense growth habit make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Fimbristylis capillaris f. minima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
