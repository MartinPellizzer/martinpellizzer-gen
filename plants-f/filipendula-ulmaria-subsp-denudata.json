    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria subsp. denudata, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, white, fluffy flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil quality and support pollinator populations."
