    "intro": "Fragaria bucharica subsp. darvasica, commonly known as the Darvasica strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, forest edges, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but are often smaller and less sweet. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous root system. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
