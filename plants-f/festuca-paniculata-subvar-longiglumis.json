    "intro": "Festuca paniculata subvar. longiglumis, commonly known as the longawn fescue, is a cool-season grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other fescue species. Its inflorescence consists of open, panicle-like clusters of spikelets, which are elongated and often appear in a loose, weeping arrangement. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of soil conditions."
