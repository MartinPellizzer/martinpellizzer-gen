    "intro": "Fritillaria gawleri, commonly known as the Kashmirian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting black markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its cold, arid environment. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in harsh mountain conditions. Fritillaria gawleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
