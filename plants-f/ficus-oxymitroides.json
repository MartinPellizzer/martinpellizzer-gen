    "intro": "Ficus oxymitroides, commonly known as the velvetleaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage is popular for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
