    "intro": "Festuca dura var. pubifolia, commonly known as the woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought, poor soil conditions, and grazing. Festuca dura var. pubifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
