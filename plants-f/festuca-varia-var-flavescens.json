    "intro": "Festuca varia var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow hillgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically reaches heights of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more yellowish towards the tips. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance."
