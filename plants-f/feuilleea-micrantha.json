    "intro": "Feuilleea micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered feuillea, is a unique plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its moist but competitive environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance attracting pollinators like moths and small bees. Its growth habit is mostly herbaceous, with a low, spreading form that allows it to thrive in shaded undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
