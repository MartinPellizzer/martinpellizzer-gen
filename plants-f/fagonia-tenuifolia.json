    "intro": "Fagonia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf fagonia, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Fagonia tenuifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
