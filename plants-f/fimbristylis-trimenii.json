This species typically grows in wet or seasonally wet environments such as marshes, swamps, and waterlogged soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are usually less than 30 cm tall, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters. The plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
