    "intro": "Furcraea longa, commonly known as the long-leaf furcraea, is a member of the Asparagaceae family native to South America. It is a robust, evergreen shrub characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are fibrous and can be used for thatching or weaving, making it valuable in traditional practices. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
