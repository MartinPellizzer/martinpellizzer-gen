    "intro": "Ficus lobata, commonly known as the Chinese banyan, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and can grow to be quite large, often with a sprawling canopy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are an important food source for various animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ficus lobata is also known for its ability to adapt to different soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
