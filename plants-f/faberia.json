These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and pea-like flowers, which typically have five petals. Faberia species are often found in temperate and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils. They play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Some species are cultivated for ornamental purposes or used in traditional medicine."
