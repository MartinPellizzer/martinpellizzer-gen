    "intro": "Ficus williamsii var. epiphytica, commonly known as the silver satinwood or epiphytic ficus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a waxy texture. This variety is typically an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and bonsai cultivation."
