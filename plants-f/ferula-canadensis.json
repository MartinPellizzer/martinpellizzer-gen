    "intro": "Ferula canadensis, commonly known as Canadian giant fennel, is a tall, aromatic perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, and its roots are thick, fleshy, and often used in traditional medicine. Ferula canadensis thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands."
