    "intro": "Frankenia florida, commonly known as the Florida beach sunflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty, arid conditions. Frankenia florida is well adapted to coastal ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing dune sands."
