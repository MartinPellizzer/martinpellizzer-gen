    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. obtusiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a variant of the European ash tree characterized by its narrower leaves and slightly rounded leaf tips. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical species, with a slower growth rate and a tendency to form a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin. It is often found in woodland areas and along riverbanks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally used in horticultural settings."
