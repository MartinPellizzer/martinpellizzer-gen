    "intro": "Ferula wolgensis, commonly known as the Tibetan giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of other members of the carrot family. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Ferula wolgensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh climatic conditions."
