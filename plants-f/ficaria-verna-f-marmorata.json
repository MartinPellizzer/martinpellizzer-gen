    "intro": "Ficaria verna f. marmorata, commonly known as the winter cabbage or snowdrop, is a perennial plant native to Europe. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and slightly succulent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its early blooming habit and distinctive foliage patterns."
