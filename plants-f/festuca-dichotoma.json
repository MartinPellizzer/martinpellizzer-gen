    "intro": "Festuca dichotoma, commonly known as the bentgrass or mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca dichotoma thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Its ability to form dense vegetation makes it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
