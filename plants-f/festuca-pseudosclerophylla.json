It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Festuca pseudosclerophylla is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
