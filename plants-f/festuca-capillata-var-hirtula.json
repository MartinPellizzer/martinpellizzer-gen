    "intro": "Festuca capillata var. hirtula, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. This variety is particularly adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form extensive, cohesive turf, making it valuable for erosion control. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with glumes that are hairy and often longer than the lemma."
