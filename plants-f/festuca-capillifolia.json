    "intro": "Festuca capillifolia, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca capillifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions."
