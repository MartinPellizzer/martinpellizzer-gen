It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape with a smooth texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
