    "intro": "Franciscea divaricata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs on the leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
