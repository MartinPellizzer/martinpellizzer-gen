    "intro": "Fraxinus americana, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 9 to 15 oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured and scaly with age. The white ash is valued for its strong, straight-grained wood, which has been used historically for furniture and sports equipment."
