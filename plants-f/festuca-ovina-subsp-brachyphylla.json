    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an important component of alpine vegetation and a valuable forage plant for grazing animals."
