    "intro": "Fagopyrum crispatifolium, commonly known as the hairy buckwheat, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated, hairy leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by triangular, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along rocky slopes. Due to its nutritional value, it has been used in traditional herbal medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
