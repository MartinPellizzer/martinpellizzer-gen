    "intro": "Fedia eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fruit tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Its thick, waxy leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, making it well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. Fedia eriocarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
