    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. subheterophylla, commonly known as red fescue with variable leaf form, is a variant of red fescue characterized by its distinct leaf morphology. This grass species exhibits a unique combination of long, narrow leaves and shorter, broader blades, which is a key feature of its heterophyllous trait. It is typically found in moist, acidic soils and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in cooler climates, making it suitable for shaded or partially shaded areas. Its ability to form dense, fine-textured turf makes it a popular choice for lawns and groundcover in temperate regions."
