    "intro": "Festuca delicatula, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Festuca delicatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
