    "intro": "Fagonia ovalifolia var. qatarensis, commonly known as the Qatari fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme heat and limited water availability, making it a resilient species in desert environments. Its woody stems and thick leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. This variety is often found in rocky and sandy soils, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
