    "intro": "Ficus kamelii, commonly known as the Kamel's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ficus kamelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
