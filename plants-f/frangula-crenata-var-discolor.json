    "intro": "Frangula crenata var. discolor, commonly known as the variegated senna, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which have a yellow-green variegation pattern on the upper surface and a pale white underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in certain regions."
