    "intro": "Ficus barbata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white figs that are often hidden within a cup-like structure called a syconium. It thrives in humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in landscaping. Ficus barbata is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
