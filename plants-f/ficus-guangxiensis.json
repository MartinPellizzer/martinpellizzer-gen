It is native to southern China, particularly the Guangxi region, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
