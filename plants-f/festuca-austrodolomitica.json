    "intro": "Festuca austrodolomitica, commonly known as the Dolomitic Festuca, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to harsh mountain environments. This plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca austrodolomitica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna. Its resilience to cold and drought makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
