    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated wild strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves, which display a mix of green and white or yellow markings. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, edible berries that are often less sweet than those of the common strawberry. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
