    "intro": "Fimbristylis acuminata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spike-rush, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands, marshes, or along the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in dense spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
