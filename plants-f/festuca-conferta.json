    "intro": "Festuca conferta, commonly known as the dense fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca conferta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, wet conditions."
