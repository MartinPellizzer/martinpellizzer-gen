    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica pendula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a striking variant of the European white birch. It is characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This species is valued for its aesthetic qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its ornamental value."
