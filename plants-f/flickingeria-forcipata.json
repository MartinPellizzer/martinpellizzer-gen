    "intro": "Flickingeria forcipata, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving water bodies. The leaves are supported by long, flexible petioles that help keep them buoyant."
