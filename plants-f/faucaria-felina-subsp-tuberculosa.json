It features small, fleshy, tuberculate leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
