    "intro": "Filix patens var. stipularis, commonly known as the stipe fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
