    "intro": "Frangula acuminatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
