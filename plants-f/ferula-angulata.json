    "intro": "Ferula angulata, commonly known as the Indian cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, elongated fruit capsules. Its roots contain a milky sap, which has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine. Ferula angulata is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in perfumery."
