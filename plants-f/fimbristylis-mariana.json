    "intro": "Fimbristylis mariana, commonly known as the Florida sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of the Caribbean. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Fimbristylis mariana is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
