    "intro": "Ficus polyantha, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that often display striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are important for wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and partial shade. Ficus polyantha is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
