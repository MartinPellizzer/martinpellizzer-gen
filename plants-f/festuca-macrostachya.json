    "intro": "Festuca macrostachya, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Festuca macrostachya is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
