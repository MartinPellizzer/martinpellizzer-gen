It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branching. Folotsia grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
