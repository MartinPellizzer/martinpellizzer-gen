    "intro": "Freziera parva, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Freziera parva is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
