    "intro": "Festuca nervosa, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow, flat, and have a prominent midvein, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
