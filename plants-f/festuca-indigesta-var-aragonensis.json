    "intro": "Festuca indigesta var. aragonensis, commonly known as Aragon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
