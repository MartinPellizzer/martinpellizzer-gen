    "intro": "Ficus lacandonensis, commonly known as the Lacandon fig tree, is a species of fig tree native to the humid lowland forests of southern Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, clustered figs that are often enclosed in a spiny receptacle, a characteristic feature of many fig species. The tree plays an important role in the ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
