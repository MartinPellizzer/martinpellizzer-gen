    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated European beech, is a variant of the European beech tree characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves. This deciduous tree is native to central and northern Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, turning yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
