    "intro": "Fagus lucida var. opienica, commonly known as the opienic beech, is a variant of the beech tree native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are often glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts encased in a spiny husk. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and ecological role in its native habitat."
