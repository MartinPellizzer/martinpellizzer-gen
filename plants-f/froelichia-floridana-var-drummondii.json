    "intro": "Froelichia floridana var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's froelichia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Florida. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant features hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are adapted to the moist, sandy soils of its natural habitat. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in areas with seasonal flooding. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
