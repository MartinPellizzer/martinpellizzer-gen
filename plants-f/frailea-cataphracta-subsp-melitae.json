    "intro": "Frailea cataphracta subsp. melitae, commonly known as the Maltese cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Mediterranean island of Malta. It features a globular stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and protected species."
