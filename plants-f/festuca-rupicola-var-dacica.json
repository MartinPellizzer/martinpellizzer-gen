    "intro": "Festuca rupicola var. dacica, commonly known as the Dacian rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh, alpine conditions."
