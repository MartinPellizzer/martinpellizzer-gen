    "intro": "Ficus benghalensis, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a large, tropical tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its aerial roots that hang from its branches and eventually reach the ground, forming a network of supporting structures. The tree has broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit, known as a fig, is enclosed in a green, fleshy structure that turns brown when mature. Ficus benghalensis is often found in moist, fertile soils and can grow to impressive sizes, making it a prominent feature in many tropical landscapes."
