    "intro": "Freycinetia demissa, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which are often followed by orange or red berries. Freycinetia demissa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
