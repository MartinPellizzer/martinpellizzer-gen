    "intro": "Festuca deserti subsp. maroccana, commonly known as Moroccan desert fescue, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppes and desert margins. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies in harsh environments."
