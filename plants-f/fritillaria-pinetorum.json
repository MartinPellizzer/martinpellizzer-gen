    "intro": "Fritillaria pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in pine and fir forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. Fritillaria pinetorum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
