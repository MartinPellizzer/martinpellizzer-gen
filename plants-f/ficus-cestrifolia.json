    "intro": "Ficus cestrifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or oval in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, followed by round, smooth, greenish fruits that turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus cestrifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
