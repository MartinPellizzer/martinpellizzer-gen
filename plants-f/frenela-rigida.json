    "intro": "Frenela rigida, commonly known as the rigid frenel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are typically rigid and have a distinctive blue-gray coloration. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
