    "intro": "Festuca deserti subvar. pozzicola, commonly known as the desert fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions due to its deep root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in desert scrublands and is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in its range."
