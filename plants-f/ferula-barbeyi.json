    "intro": "Ferula barbeyi, commonly known as the Afghan ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its most notable feature is its large, fibrous root, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural rubber. Ferula barbeyi thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes."
