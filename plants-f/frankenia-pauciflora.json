    "intro": "Frankenia pauciflora, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Frankenia pauciflora is often found in dune environments and is well-suited to sandy, well-drained soils."
