    "intro": "Facchinia cherlerioides, commonly known as the rock heather, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically bright green, sometimes with a bluish or silver hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in coastal landscapes."
