    "intro": "Festuca scabra var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-ranked spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
