    "intro": "Fraxinus oxyphylla subsp. montagnei, commonly known as the Montagne's ash, is a member of the Oleaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in humid, temperate forest environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
