It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
