    "intro": "Fagonia californica, commonly known as the California fagonia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and rough, fissured bark. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Fagonia californica is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
