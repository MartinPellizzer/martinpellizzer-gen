    "intro": "Fritillaria tenella var. pollinensis, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a long, narrow leaf that emerges from the base of the bulb, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is closely related to other members of the Fritillaria genus, which are known for their showy blooms and medicinal uses."
