    "intro": "Fabiana grandiflora, commonly known as the silverleaf fabiana, is a shrub native to South America. It features silver-gray foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive, long-lasting flowers and drought tolerance."
