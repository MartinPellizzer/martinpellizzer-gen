    "intro": "Fagonia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Fagonia viscosa is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in scrublands and rocky habitats."
