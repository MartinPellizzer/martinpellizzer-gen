    "intro": "Fumana glutinosa var. vulgare, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sticky secretions serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and also aid in seed dispersal. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
