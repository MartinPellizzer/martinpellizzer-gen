    "intro": "Festuca lenensis subsp. albifolia, commonly known as the white-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, forming dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its delicate appearance."
