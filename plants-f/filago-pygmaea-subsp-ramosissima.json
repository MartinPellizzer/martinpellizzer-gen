    "intro": "Filago pygmaea subsp. ramosissima, commonly known as the dwarf filago, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions."
