    "intro": "Ficus gentlei, commonly known as the gentle fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. It is a popular houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus gentlei produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig-like fruits, though these are typically not consumed by humans."
