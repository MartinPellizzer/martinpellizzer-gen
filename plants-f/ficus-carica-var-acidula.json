    "intro": "Ficus carica var. acidula, commonly known as the sour fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its small, tart, and often edible fruits that differ from the typical sweet figs. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a dark green upper surface. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The sour fig is often cultivated for its unique flavor and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
