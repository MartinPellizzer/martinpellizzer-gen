    "intro": "Frappieria montana, commonly known as the mountain frappier, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
