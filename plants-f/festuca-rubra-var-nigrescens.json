It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, low-growing habit. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray sheen. This variety is often used in lawns and turfgrass due to its durability and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
