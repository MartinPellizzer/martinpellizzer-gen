    "intro": "Forestiera retusa, commonly known as the smooth forestiera, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant features narrow, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Its showy white flowers, which appear in clusters, bloom in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
