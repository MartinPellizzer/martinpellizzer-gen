    "intro": "Festuca bromoides var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight bluish hue, which distinguishes it from other grass species. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers."
