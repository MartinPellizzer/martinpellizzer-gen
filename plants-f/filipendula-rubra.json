    "intro": "Filipendula rubra, commonly known as crimson clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Filipendula rubra is often used in agricultural settings as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and can be found in gardens and natural habitats."
