It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and mostly basal, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Fimbristylis retusa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems."
