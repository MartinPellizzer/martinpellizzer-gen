    "intro": "Fraxinus orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters, and it produces samaras as its fruit. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making."
