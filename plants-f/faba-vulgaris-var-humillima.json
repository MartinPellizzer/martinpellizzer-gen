    "intro": "Faba vulgaris var. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf edible bean, is a variety of the broad bean species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Due to its smaller size, it is well-suited for garden cultivation and space-efficient farming."
