    "intro": "Festuca unilateralis subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a coastal plant adapted to saline and sandy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is typically found in dune systems and salt marshes along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Its ability to tolerate salt and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal succession."
