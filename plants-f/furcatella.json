It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant produces small, lantern-like fruits that hang from the stems, giving it its whimsical common name. Native to the Canary Islands, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Furcatella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable climates."
