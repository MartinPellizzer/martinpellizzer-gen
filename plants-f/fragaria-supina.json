    "intro": "Fragaria supina, commonly known as the creeping strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of the common strawberry. The plant has a low-growing, sprawling habit with runners that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals. The botanical features of Fragaria supina make it a hardy and adaptable species suitable for various garden environments."
