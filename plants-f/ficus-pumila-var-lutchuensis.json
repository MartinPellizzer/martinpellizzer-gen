    "intro": "Ficus pumila var. lutchuensis, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is a vining plant characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and ability to climb or trail along surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
