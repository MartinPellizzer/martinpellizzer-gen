    "intro": "Fuchsia fontinalis, commonly known as the water fuchsia, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant features delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fuchsia fontinalis is often used in water gardens and can thrive in containers as long as the water is clean and well-oxygenated."
