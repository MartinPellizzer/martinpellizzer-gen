    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria var. subdenudata, commonly known as white sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often covered in fine hairs, and its showy, fluffy white or pale pink flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist soils along streambanks, meadows, and wetlands. It produces small, trifoliate leaves and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in wet environments. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
