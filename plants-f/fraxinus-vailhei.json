It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its delicate, feathery foliage. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a finely serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy plant in dry, well-drained soils."
