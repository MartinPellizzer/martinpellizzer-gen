    "intro": "Fumana thymifolia f. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved thyme-leaved fumana, is a unique variant of the fumana plant characterized by its diminutive, aromatic leaves. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically features finely divided, fern-like foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. Its small leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. This botanical feature not only enhances its visual appeal but also plays a role in its ecological interactions and medicinal properties."
