    "intro": "Fagraea tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, opposite leaves that are typically four-angled in cross-section. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in terminal panicles, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, often making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Fagraea tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
