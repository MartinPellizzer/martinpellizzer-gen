    "intro": "Filicium, commonly known as the fern, is a group of vascular plants that have been around since the Devonian period. They are characterized by their feather-like fronds, which are made up of smaller leaflets called pinnae. Ferns reproduce through spores rather than seeds, and they typically thrive in moist, shaded environments. They play an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various organisms. Many species of ferns are also valued for their ornamental beauty in gardens and landscapes."
