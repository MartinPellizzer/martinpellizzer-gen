    "intro": "Franquevillia minima, commonly known as the dwarf fraxinella, is a small shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage with small, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, winged fruits that are characteristic of the Oleaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
