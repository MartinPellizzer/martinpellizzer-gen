    "intro": "Fumaria alba, commonly known as white smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, mildly toxic alkaloid called fumarine, which gives it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Fumaria alba is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxic properties."
