    "intro": "Frailea pumila, commonly known as the miniature stone cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a globular stem covered in white, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
