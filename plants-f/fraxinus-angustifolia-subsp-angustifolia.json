    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib, and they turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
