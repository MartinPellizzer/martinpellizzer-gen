    "intro": "Fritillaria graminifolia, commonly known as the grass-leaved fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Fritillaria graminifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
