    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. eflagellis, commonly known as the flagellate strawberry, is a rare variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its elongated, whip-like leaves that differ from the typical trifoliate structure of standard strawberries. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in taste to regular strawberries but are often less common in cultivation. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in temperate regions. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation."
