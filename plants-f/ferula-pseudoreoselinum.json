    "intro": "Ferula pseudoreoselinum, commonly known as the Kashmiri giant fennel, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, aromatic stature. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in northern India and Pakistan. The plant features large, compound leaves and produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its hollow, cylindrical stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine environments."
