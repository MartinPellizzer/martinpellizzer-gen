    "intro": "Ferula caruifolia, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, capable of storing significant amounts of water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Ferula caruifolia is also noted for its aromatic resin, which has been traditionally used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
