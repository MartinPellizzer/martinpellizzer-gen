    "intro": "Ficus mutabilis, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often feature striking white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically green when mature, though some varieties may turn red or purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus mutabilis is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
