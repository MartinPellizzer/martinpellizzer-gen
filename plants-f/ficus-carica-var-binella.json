    "intro": "Ficus carica var. binella, commonly known as the Smyrna fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, sweet, and edible fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green, as they ripen off the tree. The plant has a broad, spreading canopy with heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath. It thrives in warm, dry climates and is well-suited for cultivation in temperate regions with mild winters. The Smyrna fig is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
