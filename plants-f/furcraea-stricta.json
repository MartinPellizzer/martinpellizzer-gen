    "intro": "Furcraea stricta, commonly known as the sword plant or narrow-leaf aloe, is a perennial succulent native to Mexico and Central America. It features tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that are dark green with a waxy coating, adapted for water retention in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its architectural form and drought tolerance. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine and for making fiber."
