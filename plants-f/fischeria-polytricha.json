    "intro": "Fischeria polytricha, commonly known as the hairy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a central axis and lateral branches covered in short, hairy structures called rhizoids. Its leaves are small, closely spaced, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fischeria polytricha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
