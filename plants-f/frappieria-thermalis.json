    "intro": "Frappieria thermalis, commonly known as the thermal fern, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to extreme thermal environments. It thrives in geothermal areas with high temperatures and mineral-rich soils, often found near hot springs and volcanic regions. The plant exhibits unique morphological adaptations, such as thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid, heat-stressed conditions. Its reproductive structures are modified to ensure successful pollination in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Frappieria thermalis is considered a valuable indicator species for geothermal ecosystems."
