    "intro": "Fritillaria viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale green to yellow and orange, often with a distinctive mottled pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid and rocky environments, storing moisture and nutrients efficiently. Fritillaria viridiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
