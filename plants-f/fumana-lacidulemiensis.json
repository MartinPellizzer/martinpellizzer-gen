It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
