    "intro": "Fraxinus tamariscifolia f. monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf ash, is a rare foliage variant of the ash tree characterized by its unique monophyllous leaves. This form exhibits a striking reduction in leaf complexity, with each leaf typically having a single, elongated blade rather than the usual opposite or alternate arrangement. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological distinctiveness, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
