    "intro": "Fosterella hatschbachii, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is characterized by its compact rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, emerge from the center of the rosette. Fosterella hatschbachii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
