    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla subsp. breviculmis, commonly known as the short-stemmed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its dense growth helps stabilize soil and provides habitat for small Arctic organisms."
