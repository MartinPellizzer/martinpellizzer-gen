    "intro": "Festuca versuta, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca versuta is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand drought and cold temperatures. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
