    "intro": "Franseria chamissonis var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky franseria, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a sticky surface that aids in water retention and deterring herbivores. This variety is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a characteristic component of coastal scrub habitats."
