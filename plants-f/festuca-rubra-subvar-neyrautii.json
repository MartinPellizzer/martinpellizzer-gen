    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. neyrautii, commonly known as the Neyraut's red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
