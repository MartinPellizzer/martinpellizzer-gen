    "intro": "Fragaria moschata dioica, commonly known as the musk strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, red, edible fruits that develop from its flowers. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained, fertile soil. It produces both male and female flowers on separate plants, a trait known as dioecy. This botanical feature influences its pollination and fruit-set processes."
