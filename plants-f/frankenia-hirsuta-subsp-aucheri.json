    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta subsp. aucheri, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, grey-green foliage that is adapted to sandy and saline soils. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments, and it is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure compared to other Frankenia species."
