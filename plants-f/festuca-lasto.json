    "intro": "Festuca lasto, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. Festuca lasto is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
