    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. pomeliana, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 feet and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a smooth margin with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species is well adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, often found along riverbanks and in flood-prone areas."
