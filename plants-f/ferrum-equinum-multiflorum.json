It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble small flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
