    "intro": "Festuca bosniaca subsp. pirinensis, commonly known as the Pirin fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-ranked spikelets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
