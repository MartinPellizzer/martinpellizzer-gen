    "intro": "Froelichia caricoides, commonly known as the yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often surrounded by bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Froelichia caricoides plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
