    "intro": "Fagonia subaphylla, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss through transpiration. Fagonia subaphylla is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
