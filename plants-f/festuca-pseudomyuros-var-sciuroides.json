    "intro": "Festuca pseudomyuros var. sciuroides, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in panicles. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
