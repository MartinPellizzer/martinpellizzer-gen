    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. kitaibeliana, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant produces spikelets that are often reddish in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth helps it spread and form dense turf."
