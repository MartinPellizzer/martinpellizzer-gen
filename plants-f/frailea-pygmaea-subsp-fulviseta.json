    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea subsp. fulviseta, commonly known as the yellow-flowered stone cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to Brazil. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green surface that often has a slight yellowish hue. The plant produces dense clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
