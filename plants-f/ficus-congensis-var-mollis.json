    "intro": "Ficus congensis var. mollis, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive, almost velvety texture. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a deep green color. This variety is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, edible fruits."
