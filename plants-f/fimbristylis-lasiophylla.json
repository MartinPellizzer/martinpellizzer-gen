It is native to Australia and is typically found in wetland or swampy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
