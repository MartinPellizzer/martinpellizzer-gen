    "intro": "Festuca lazistanica, commonly known as Lazistan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
