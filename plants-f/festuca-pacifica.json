    "intro": "Festuca pacifica, commonly known as Pacific bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime forests. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, blue-green leaves that are often matted together. Its flowering spikes are usually pale blue to purple, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Festuca pacifica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
