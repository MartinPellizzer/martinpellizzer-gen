    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior proles parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in drooping clusters and are followed by winged samaras that disperse by wind. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in furniture and cabinet-making."
