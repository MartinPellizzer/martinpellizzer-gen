It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Festuca longidiurna is known for its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions, including moderate drought. Its flowering spikes are usually arranged in panicle-like clusters, producing small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated."
