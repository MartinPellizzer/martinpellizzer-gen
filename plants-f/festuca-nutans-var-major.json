    "intro": "Festuca nutans var. major, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, with leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is a popular choice for erosion control and landscaping in temperate climates."
