    "intro": "Farreria pretiosa, commonly known as the golden bell, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun. The seeds are encased in a hard pod and are dispersed by animals or through mechanical means."
