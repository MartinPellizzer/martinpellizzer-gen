It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland and the Northern Territory. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
