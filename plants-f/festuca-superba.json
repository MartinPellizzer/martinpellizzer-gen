    "intro": "Festuca superba, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Festuca superba produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
