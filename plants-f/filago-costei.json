    "intro": "Filago costei, commonly known as the coastal filago, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs to reduce water loss. Filago costei plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
