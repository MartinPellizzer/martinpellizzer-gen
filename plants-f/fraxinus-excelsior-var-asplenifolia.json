    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. asplenifolia, commonly known as the asplenifolium ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves that resemble those of the fern *Asplenium*. This species is native to western Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland habitats. Its leaves are typically narrower and more deeply lobed than those of the standard *Fraxinus excelsior*, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
