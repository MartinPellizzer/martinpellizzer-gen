It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Flourensia hirta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
