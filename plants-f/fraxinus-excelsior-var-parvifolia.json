    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, small, ovate leaves that are typically 3\u20136 cm in length. The leaves are usually dark green on top and paler underneath, with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
