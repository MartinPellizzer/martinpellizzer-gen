    "intro": "Fumaria nobilis, commonly known as the noble smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that resemble small smoke-like clouds. The plant produces slender, branched stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Fumaria nobilis blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in woodland edges or along roadsides."
