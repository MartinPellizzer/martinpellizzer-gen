    "intro": "Firkea rosea, commonly known as the pink fir tree, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its distinctive pinkish-red bark that becomes more vibrant with age. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are needle-like and arranged spirally along the branches, giving it a dense, evergreen appearance. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Firkea rosea is considered a conservation concern."
