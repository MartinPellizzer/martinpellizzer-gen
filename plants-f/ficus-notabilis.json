    "intro": "Ficus notabilis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical species native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with thick, buttressed roots and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by the edible, starchy fruit that is the primary reason for its cultivation. Its botanical features include a unique sympodial growth pattern and the ability to produce both male and female flowers on the same plant. The breadfruit tree plays an important ecological and cultural role in many tropical communities."
