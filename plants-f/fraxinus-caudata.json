It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by long, bean-like pods containing its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance."
