    "intro": "Filix-mas noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York fern, is a species of fern native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
