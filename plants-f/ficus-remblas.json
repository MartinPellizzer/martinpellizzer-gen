    "intro": "Ficus remblas, commonly known as the Remblas fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green or yellow when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus remblas is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
