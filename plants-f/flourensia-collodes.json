    "intro": "Flourensia collodes, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features include showy inflorescences and a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
