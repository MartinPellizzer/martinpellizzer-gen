    "intro": "Fumana glutinosa var. hispidula, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a variant of the fumana plant characterized by its glandular, sticky hairs on its stems and leaves. It is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of the sticky secretions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. The plant is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
