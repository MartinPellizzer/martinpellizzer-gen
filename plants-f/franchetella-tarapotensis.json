    "intro": "Franchetella tarapotensis, commonly known as the Tarapotensis sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and lacks a shell, typical of many opisthobranch mollusks. The plant, more accurately a marine invertebrate, is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. Its body is often covered in a thin layer of mucus, which helps in reducing water loss and protecting against predators. Franchetella tarapotensis plays a role in marine ecosystems as both a herbivore and a prey species."
