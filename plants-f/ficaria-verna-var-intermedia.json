    "intro": "Ficaria verna var. intermedia, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive nodding white flowers that resemble tiny snowflakes, which bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ficaria verna var. intermedia is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
