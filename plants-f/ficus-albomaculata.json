    "intro": "Ficus albomaculata, commonly known as the Variegated Ficus or White-spotted Fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or pale yellow spots, which give it its common name. The plant has a sturdy, woody stem that can be trained into various shapes, making it popular as a houseplant. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits, though the fruits are typically not edible for humans. Ficus albomaculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health and vibrant foliage."
