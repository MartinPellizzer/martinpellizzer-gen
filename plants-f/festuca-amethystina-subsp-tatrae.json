    "intro": "Festuca amethystina subsp. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage that reflects its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
