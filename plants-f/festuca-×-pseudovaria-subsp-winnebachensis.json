    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 pseudovaria subsp. winnebachensis, commonly known as the Winnebach meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
