    "intro": "Frenela triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to parts of South America. It features fronds that are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Frenela triquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
