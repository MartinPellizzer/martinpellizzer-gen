    "intro": "Faba vulgaris var. orbicularis, commonly known as the broadleaf vetch, is a leguminous plant characterized by its distinctive orbicular leaves. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. The leaves and young pods are also edible and have been used in traditional cuisines."
