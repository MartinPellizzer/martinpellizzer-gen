    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. eubriquetii, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or tufts, with slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant and cold-tolerant nature. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
