    "intro": "Forsythia suspensa f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy forsythia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to China. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage consists of ovate, dark green leaves with a hairy texture, which gives the plant its specific epithet \"pubescens.\" It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its early spring blooms and hardy nature. This variety is well-suited for small gardens or as a border plant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
