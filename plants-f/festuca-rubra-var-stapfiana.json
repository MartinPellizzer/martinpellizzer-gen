    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. stapfiana, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late spring to early summer."
