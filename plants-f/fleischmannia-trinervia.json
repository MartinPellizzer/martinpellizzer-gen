    "intro": "Fleischmannia trinervia, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its milkweed-like sap is milky and latexy, which can be toxic if ingested. Fleischmannia trinervia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks."
