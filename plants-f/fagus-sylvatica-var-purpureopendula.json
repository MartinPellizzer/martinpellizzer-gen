    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. purpureopendula, commonly known as the purple-leafed European beech, is a variant of the European beech tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. This cultivar features leaves that turn a striking purplish-red color during the autumn season, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It retains the typical broad, oval shape of the European beech but exhibits more compact growth and enhanced coloration. The tree is deciduous, shedding its leaves in winter, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to temperate climates."
