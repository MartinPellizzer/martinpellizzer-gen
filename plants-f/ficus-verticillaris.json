    "intro": "Ficus verticillaris, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish-yellow figs, which are typically not edible for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb or trail along surfaces. Ficus verticillaris is also popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
