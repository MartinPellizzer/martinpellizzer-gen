    "intro": "Ficus macrorrhyncha, commonly known as the large-veined fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Ficus macrorrhyncha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
