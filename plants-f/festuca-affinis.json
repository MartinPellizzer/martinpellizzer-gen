    "intro": "Festuca affinis, commonly known as fine fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing sods. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, making it a common ornamental and turfgrass species. Festuca affinis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand moderate foot traffic. Its botanical features include small, spike-like inflorescences and tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
