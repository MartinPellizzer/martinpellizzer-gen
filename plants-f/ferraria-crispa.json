    "intro": "Ferraria crispa, commonly known as the crinkled bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Ferraria crispa is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
