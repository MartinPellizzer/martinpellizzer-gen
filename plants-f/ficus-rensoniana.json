    "intro": "Ficus rensoniana, commonly known as the Renson's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rensoniana is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
