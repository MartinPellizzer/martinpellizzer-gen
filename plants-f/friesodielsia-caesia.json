It features a pale blue to greenish thallus with a distinct, wrinkled texture. The plant's structure consists of a fungal component that forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique coloration make it a notable species in ecological studies."
