    "intro": "Festuca trachyphylla, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca trachyphylla is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
