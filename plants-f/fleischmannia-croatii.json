    "intro": "Fleischmannia croatii, commonly known as the Croatian fleischmannia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Croatia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing white to pale yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fleischmannia croatii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
