    "intro": "Festuca ultramafica, commonly known as the ultramafic fescue, is a hardy grass species adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, ultramafic soils. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant exhibits a high tolerance for extreme conditions, including poor soil pH and low nutrient availability. It is typically found in mountainous regions with rocky, well-drained soils. Festuca ultramafica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its specialized habitat."
