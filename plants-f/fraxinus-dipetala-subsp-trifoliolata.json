    "intro": "Fraxinus dipetala subsp. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf ash, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clustered inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
