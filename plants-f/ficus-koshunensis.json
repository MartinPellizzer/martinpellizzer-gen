    "intro": "Ficus koshunensis, commonly known as the Koshunensis Fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus koshunensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
