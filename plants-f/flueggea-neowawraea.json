    "intro": "Flueggea neowawraea, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, hairy leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. The species is adapted to withstand drought and has a slow growth rate, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
