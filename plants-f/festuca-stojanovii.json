    "intro": "Festuca stojanovii, commonly known as Stojanov's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. Festuca stojanovii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
