    "intro": "Flourensia cernua, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing a compact, mat-forming growth habit. Its silvery-gray foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are often followed by white or pale pink ray florets, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
