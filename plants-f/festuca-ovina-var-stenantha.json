    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. stenantha, commonly known as narrowleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
