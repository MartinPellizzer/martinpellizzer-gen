    "intro": "Fraxinus edentata, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters with a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and stream valleys."
