    "intro": "Festuca silvatica, commonly known as silvery fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-ranked flowers. Festuca silvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
