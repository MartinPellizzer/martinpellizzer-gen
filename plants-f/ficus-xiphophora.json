    "intro": "Ficus xiphophora, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, waxy, pointed leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb or trail along surfaces, making it popular in hanging baskets and as a ground cover. Ficus xiphophora thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight."
