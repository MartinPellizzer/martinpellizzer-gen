    "intro": "Festuca dissitiflora var. trachyphylla, commonly known as the roughleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca dissitiflora var. trachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
