    "intro": "Fraxinus pallisiae var. horvatii, commonly known as the Horvat's ash, is a rare variant of the ash tree native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that disperse via wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
