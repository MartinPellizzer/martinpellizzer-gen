    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. maior, commonly known as the giant frailea, is a compact cactus native to Brazil. It features a short, thick stem with numerous areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
