    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Brazil. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in white to pale green areoles, from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
