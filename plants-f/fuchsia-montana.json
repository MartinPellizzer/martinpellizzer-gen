    "intro": "Fuchsia montana, commonly known as the alpine fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers in shades of pink, purple, and red, which bloom in late summer. Fuchsia montana has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
