    "intro": "Ficus erecta, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its drooping, elongated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a smooth, dark green trunk and can grow as a tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 15 meters in its natural habitat. Ficus erecta produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, edible figs that turn red when ripe. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
