It is characterized by its uniquely narrow, elongated leaves that are typically twice as long as they are wide. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and autumn color."
