It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short stem that supports its showy blooms. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to mild, temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
