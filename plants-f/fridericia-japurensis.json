    "intro": "Fridericia japurensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, round, woody fruits. It is adapted to humid, tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
