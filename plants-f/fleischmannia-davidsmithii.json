    "intro": "Fleischmannia davidsmithii, commonly known as the David Smith's fleischmannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, often found in desert regions. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves, which help it conserve water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
