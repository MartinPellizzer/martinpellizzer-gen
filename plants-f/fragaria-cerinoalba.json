    "intro": "Fragaria cerinoalba, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a rare and unique species of wild strawberry native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored fruits, which contrast sharply with the typical red berries of other strawberry species. The plant produces small, trifoliate leaves and has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters along rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinct, fragrant aroma. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, Fragaria cerinoalba is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
