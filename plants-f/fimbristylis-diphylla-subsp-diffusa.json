    "intro": "Fimbristylis diphylla subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb with grass-like leaves that are typically broad and flat, growing in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in wetlands, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its morphology and habitat make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
