    "intro": "Frankenia compacta, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Frankenia compacta is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats."
