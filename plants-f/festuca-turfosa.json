    "intro": "Festuca turfosa, commonly known as Turfgrass Festuca, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine-textured leaves, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and pastures due to its hardiness and adaptability. Festuca turfosa is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
