    "intro": "Festuca atlantica var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the Atlantic bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in salty, wind-swept environments. The plant typically forms dense mats or low-growing clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in harsh coastal habitats."
