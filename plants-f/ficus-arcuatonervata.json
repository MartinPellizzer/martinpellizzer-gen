It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive arcuate venation pattern, which is a key identifying feature. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in syconia. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, warm climates."
