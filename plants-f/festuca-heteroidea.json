    "intro": "Festuca heteroidea, commonly known as mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, elongated, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Festuca heteroidea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
