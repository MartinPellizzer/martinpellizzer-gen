    "intro": "Fimbristylis quinquangularis var. bistaminifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
