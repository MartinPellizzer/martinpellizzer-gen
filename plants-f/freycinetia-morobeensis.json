    "intro": "Freycinetia morobeensis, commonly known as the Morobe palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the island of Bougainville in the Solomon Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, which are followed by clustered, red-brown fruits. Freycinetia morobeensis is adapted to tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland forest areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
