    "intro": "Filago davisii, commonly known as the Davis's filago, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Filago davisii is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources."
