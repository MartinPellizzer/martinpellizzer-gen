    "intro": "Frumentum junceum, commonly known as slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other damp habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
