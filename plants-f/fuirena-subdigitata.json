    "intro": "Fuirena subdigitata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its slow growth and high demand for its wood, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
