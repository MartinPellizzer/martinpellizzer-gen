It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are small and ovate with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, orange-red fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance requirements."
