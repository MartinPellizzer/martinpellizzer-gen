    "intro": "Fagus americana latifolia, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spherical nuts enclosed in a spiky husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can grow up to 30 meters tall. The American beech is also notable for its ability to form dense canopies, providing habitat for a variety of forest species."
