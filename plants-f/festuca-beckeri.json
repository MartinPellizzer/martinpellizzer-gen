    "intro": "Festuca beckeri, commonly known as Becker's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
