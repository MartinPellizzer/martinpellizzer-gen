    "intro": "Fimbristylis albicans, commonly known as the white-haired sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments. Fimbristylis albicans is characterized by its finely hairy inflorescences, which give it its common name."
