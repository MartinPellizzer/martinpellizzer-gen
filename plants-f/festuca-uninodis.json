    "intro": "Festuca uninodis, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca uninodis is often found in open, disturbed soils such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
