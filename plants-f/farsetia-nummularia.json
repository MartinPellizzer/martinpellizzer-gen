    "intro": "Farsetia nummularia, commonly known as the silver geranium, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features small, rounded, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, five-petaled, pale pink to white flowers throughout the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
