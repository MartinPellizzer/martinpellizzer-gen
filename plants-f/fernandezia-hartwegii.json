    "intro": "Fernandezia hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's fern, is a rare and endangered species of fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
