    "intro": "Festuca woodii, commonly known as Wood's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca woodii is often found in rocky or alpine environments where it forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
