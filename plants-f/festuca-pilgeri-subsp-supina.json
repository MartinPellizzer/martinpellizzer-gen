    "intro": "Festuca pilgeri subsp. supina, commonly known as the creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soils in alpine and rocky habitats."
