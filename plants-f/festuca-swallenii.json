    "intro": "Festuca swallenii, commonly known as Swallen's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Festuca swallenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
