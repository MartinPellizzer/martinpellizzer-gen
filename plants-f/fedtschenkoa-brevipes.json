    "intro": "Fedtschenkoa brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed lily, is a rare and striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it is characterized by its distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
