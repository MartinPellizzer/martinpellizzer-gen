It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. It produces a distinctive, aromatic fragrance and is known for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies. The f. pulchrifolia form is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure and showier floral display compared to the typical species."
