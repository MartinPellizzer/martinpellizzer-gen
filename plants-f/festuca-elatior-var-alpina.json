    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca elatior var. alpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
