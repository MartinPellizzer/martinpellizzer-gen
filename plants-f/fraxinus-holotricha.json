    "intro": "Fraxinus holotricha, commonly known as the silky ash, is a species of ash tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and its distinctive, finely hairy leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a soft, velvety texture. Fraxinus holotricha produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
