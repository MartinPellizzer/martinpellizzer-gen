    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid sheep fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often found in open, rocky, or sandy soils where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly curled, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Festuca ovina f. flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme climates."
