    "intro": "Fraxinus retusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its finely divided, dark green leaves that are narrow and elongated. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus retusa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges."
