    "intro": "Fragariopsis scandens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a climbing or trailing habit, often forming dense mats on the ground or along surfaces. Its stems are succulent and can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Fragariopsis scandens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover."
