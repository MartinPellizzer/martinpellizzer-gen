    "intro": "Fraxinus viridis, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is adaptable to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats."
