    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. arbacensis, commonly known as the Arbacan sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Its dense growth pattern makes it useful for erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation."
