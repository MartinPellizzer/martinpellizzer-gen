    "intro": "Festuca brunnescens, commonly known as the brown hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, brownish coating, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a rough texture. Festuca brunnescens produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its role in ecological systems."
