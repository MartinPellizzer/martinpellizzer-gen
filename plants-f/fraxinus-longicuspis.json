    "intro": "Fraxinus longicuspis, commonly known as the long-toothed ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves. Its fruits are samaras, each with a single wing, that disperse by wind. The longicuspis species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
