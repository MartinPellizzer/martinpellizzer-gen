    "intro": "Fritillaria bucharica, commonly known as the Caucasian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with contrasting black spots. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
