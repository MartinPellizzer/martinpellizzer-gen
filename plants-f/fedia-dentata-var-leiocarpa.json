    "intro": "Fedia dentata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fedia, is a rare variant of the fedia species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more rounded compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its habitat is usually in moist, shaded areas within tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
