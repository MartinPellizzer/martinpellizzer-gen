    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. juncea, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climatic conditions. It is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, durable lawns. Additionally, it plays a role in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
