    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often loosely arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Festuca duriuscula var. heterophylla is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
