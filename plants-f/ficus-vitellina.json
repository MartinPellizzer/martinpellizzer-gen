    "intro": "Ficus vitellina, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display striking variegation of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fig fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus vitellina is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and attractive foliage."
