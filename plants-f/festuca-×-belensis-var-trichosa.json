    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 belensis var. trichosa, commonly known as the trichose fescue, is a hybrid grass species characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant exhibits a fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family."
