    "intro": "Fenzlia retusa, commonly known as the smooth fenzlia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, erect stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth texture, which gives the species its common name. Fenzlia retusa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and forest edges."
