    "intro": "Ficus insularis, commonly known as the Canary Island date palm, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that form a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, date-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production. Ficus insularis is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
