    "intro": "Feaella plantaginea, commonly known as the rock violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in loose clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Feaella plantaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
