    "intro": "Ficus subtrinervia, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are often hidden within its dense foliage. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus subtrinervia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
