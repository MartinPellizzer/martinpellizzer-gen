    "intro": "Fimbristylis subtricephala, commonly known as the three-headed sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often brown or reddish in color. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its unique morphology and ecological preferences, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
