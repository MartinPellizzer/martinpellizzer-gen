    "intro": "Facchinia valentina, commonly known as the Valentine's facchinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
