    "intro": "Faidherbia, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a deciduous tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thorny branches. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root system, enhancing soil fertility. Its leaves are compound and trifoliate, turning bright yellow before falling in the dry season. Faidherbia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in savanna ecosystems."
