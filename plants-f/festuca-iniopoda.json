    "intro": "Festuca iniopoda, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca iniopoda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
