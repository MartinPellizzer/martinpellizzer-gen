    "intro": "Fraxinus pubinervis var. hamatoserrata, commonly known as the serrated ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have serrated margins that are finely toothed. The plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate forest environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. The bark is smooth and grayish, with longitudinal fissures that become more pronounced as the tree matures."
