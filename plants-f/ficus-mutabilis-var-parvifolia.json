    "intro": "Ficus mutabilis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in suitable environments."
