    "intro": "Fritillaria lagodechiana, commonly known as the Albanian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh environments, storing nutrients to support growth during the brief growing season. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
