    "intro": "Ficus tylophylla, commonly known as the African rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. The rubbery texture of its leaves gives it its common name, and it is valued for both ornamental and practical uses."
