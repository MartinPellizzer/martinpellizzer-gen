    "intro": "Festuca alekseevii, commonly known as Alekseev's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca alekseevii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
