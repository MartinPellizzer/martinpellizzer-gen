    "intro": "Ferulago syriaca, commonly known as Syrian ferula, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and contains compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Ferulago syriaca is often found growing in rocky or dry soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments."
