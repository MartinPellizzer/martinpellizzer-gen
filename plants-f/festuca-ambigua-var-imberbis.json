    "intro": "Festuca ambigua var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. This variety is distinguished by its lack of hairy structures on the leaves and stems, giving it a smooth appearance."
