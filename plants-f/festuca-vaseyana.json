    "intro": "Festuca vaseyana, commonly known as Vasey's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca vaseyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed habitats."
