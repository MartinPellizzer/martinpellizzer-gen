    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate weeping ash, is a variant of the weeping ash tree characterized by its distinctive, drooping branches. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and a unique notched base, giving it its botanical name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
