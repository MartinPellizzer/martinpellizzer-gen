It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and rocky soils. The plant has fine, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and it produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal environments."
