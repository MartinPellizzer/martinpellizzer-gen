    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. guestfalica, commonly known as the Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in rocky and alpine environments. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats at high elevations, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, with small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca ovina subsp. guestfalica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
