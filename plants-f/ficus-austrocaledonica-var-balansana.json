    "intro": "Ficus austrocaledonica var. balansana, commonly known as the Balansana fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Pacific islands of French Polynesia. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
