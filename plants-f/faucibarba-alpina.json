    "intro": "Faucibarba alpina, commonly known as the alpine beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Faucibarba alpina is often used in ecological studies to assess the health of alpine ecosystems due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
