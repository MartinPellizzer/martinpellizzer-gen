    "intro": "Festuca andicola, commonly known as the Andean fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of mountainous environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. Festuca andicola plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
