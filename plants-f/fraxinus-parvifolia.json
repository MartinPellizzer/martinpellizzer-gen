    "intro": "Fraxinus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically small and dark green. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus parvifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
