    "intro": "Fraxinus greggii, commonly known as Gregg's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. Gregg's ash produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
