    "intro": "Festuca hackeliana, commonly known as Hackel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically pink to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
