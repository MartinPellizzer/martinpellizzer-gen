    "intro": "Fritillaria anhuiensis, commonly known as the Anhui fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust, underground bulb that stores nutrients. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
