It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and produces small, edible fruits. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its fruit, which is smaller than the typical fig."
