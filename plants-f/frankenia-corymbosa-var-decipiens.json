    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa var. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salt exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
