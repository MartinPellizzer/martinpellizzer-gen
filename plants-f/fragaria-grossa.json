    "intro": "Fragaria grossa, commonly known as the European strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more tart than those of the common garden strawberry. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it flowers with white petals that turn pink as they age. The fruit develops from a single flower and is a popular crop for both culinary and ornamental purposes."
