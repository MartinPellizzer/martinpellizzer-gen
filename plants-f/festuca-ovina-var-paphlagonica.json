It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca ovina var. paphlagonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
