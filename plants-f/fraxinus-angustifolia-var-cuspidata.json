It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
