    "intro": "Festuca robusta var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
