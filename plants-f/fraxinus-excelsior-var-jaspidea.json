    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. jaspidea, commonly known as the white-fringed ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow fringes on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage. However, it is also susceptible to ash dieback, a fungal disease that has significantly impacted ash populations across Europe."
