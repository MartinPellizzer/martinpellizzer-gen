    "intro": "Falcatifolium falciforme var. usan-apuensis, commonly known as the Usan-Apuensis fern, is a rare and unique species native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its elongated, sickle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically found in cloud forests. Its foliage exhibits a striking variegation of green and silver tones, which helps it reflect excess light in its shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
