    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. alvarensis, commonly known as alpine red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to reddish flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
