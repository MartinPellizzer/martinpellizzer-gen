It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on short, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland areas. Ficaria vulgaris is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
