It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, bluish-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Festuca curvata produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
