    "intro": "Feaella, commonly known as the dwarf bluebell, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to lilac. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments. Feaella is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Its short stature and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and small floral arrangements."
