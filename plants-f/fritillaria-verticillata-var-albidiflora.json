    "intro": "Fritillaria verticillata var. albidiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically borne on a single, upright stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
