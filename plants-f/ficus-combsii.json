    "intro": "Ficus combsii, commonly known as the African rubber plant, is a species of fig tree native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows up to 6 meters in height. The plant features opposite, ovate-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green with a waxy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. Ficus combsii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
