The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ficus pachyrrhachis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to adapt to indoor environments."
