    "intro": "Fagus winkleriana, commonly known as the Winkler\u2019s beech, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Chile. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by triangular, woody samaras as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagus winkleriana is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
