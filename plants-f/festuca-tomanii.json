    "intro": "Festuca tomanii, commonly known as the Toman grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca tomanii is adapted to cold and arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
