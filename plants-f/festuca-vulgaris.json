    "intro": "Festuca vulgaris, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spike-like inflorescences with small, blue-green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in landscaping and for erosion control. Festuca vulgaris is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
