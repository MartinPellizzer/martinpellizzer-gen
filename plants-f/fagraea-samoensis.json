    "intro": "Fagraea samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan starwood, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa and other parts of Polynesia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many tropical shrubs and trees. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy, and its fragrant, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters. Fagraea samoensis produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in traditional Polynesian communities."
