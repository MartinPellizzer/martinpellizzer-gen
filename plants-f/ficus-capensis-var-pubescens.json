It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically clustered in spherical syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Ficus capensis var. pubescens is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
