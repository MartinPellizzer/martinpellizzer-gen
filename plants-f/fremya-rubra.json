    "intro": "Fremya rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered fremya, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers, which are typically tubular and attract nectar-feeding insects. Fremya rubra is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
