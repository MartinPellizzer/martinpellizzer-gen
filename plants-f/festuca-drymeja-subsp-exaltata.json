It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silky sheen. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, narrow panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers.
