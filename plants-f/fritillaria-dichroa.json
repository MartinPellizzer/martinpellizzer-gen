    "intro": "Fritillaria dichroa, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish-orange with a contrasting black or purple base. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps store moisture and nutrients. Fritillaria dichroa thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
