    "intro": "Ficus inamoena, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are glossy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus inamoena is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable environments."
