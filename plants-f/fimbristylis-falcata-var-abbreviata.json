    "intro": "Fimbristylis falcata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flat sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of F. falcata. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family. This variety is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions."
