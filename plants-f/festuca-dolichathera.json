    "intro": "Festuca dolichathera, commonly known as the long-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous narrow, awned lemmas, typical of the Festuca genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
