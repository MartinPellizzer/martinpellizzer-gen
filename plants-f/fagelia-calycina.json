    "intro": "Fagelia calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fagelia calycina is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in some areas."
