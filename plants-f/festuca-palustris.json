    "intro": "Festuca palustris, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland habitats. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and usually have a bluish-green color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This plant is well adapted to moist or waterlogged soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
