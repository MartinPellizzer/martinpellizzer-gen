    "intro": "Ficus corpulenta, commonly known as the giant ficus or breadfruit tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by large, round fruits resembling bread. These fruits are edible and have been an important food source for many cultures. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
