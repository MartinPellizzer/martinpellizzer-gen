    "intro": "Frailea deminuta, commonly known as the miniature moon cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, rounded stem with a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of succulent plants."
