    "intro": "Festuca varia f. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminata form of variable fescue, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, often adorned with fine, sharp tips. This form is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use in shady or partially shaded areas."
