    "intro": "Ficus syringifolia, commonly known as the silver fig or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are usually arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The plant's aerial roots and ability to climb make it suitable for training on trellises or as a hanging plant."
