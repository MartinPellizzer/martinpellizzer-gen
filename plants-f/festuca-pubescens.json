    "intro": "Festuca pubescens, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Festuca pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape."
