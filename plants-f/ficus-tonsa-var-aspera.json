    "intro": "Ficus tonsa var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though these are generally not cultivated for fruit production. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor areas. Its adaptability and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
