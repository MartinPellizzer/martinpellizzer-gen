    "intro": "Festuca pseudosupina, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Festuca pseudosupina plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
