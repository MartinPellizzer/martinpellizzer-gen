    "intro": "Festuca ovina, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a prominent midrib, while its seed heads are spike-like and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca ovina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
