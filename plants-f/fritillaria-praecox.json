    "intro": "Fritillaria praecox, commonly known as the early fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with intricate patterns resembling the markings of a frog. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in harsh environments, often remaining dormant during periods of drought. The early fritillary is a valued ornamental plant in gardens due to its unique appearance and early spring blooming habit."
