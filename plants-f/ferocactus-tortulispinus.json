    "intro": "Ferocactus tortulispinus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed for storage of water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits, known as tunas, are edible and have a sweet, juicy flavor. Ferocactus tortulispinus is well adapted to harsh desert environments, with a slow growth rate and the ability to survive long periods without rainfall."
