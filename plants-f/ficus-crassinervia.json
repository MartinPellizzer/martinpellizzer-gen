    "intro": "Ficus crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that have prominent, broad veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may turn yellow or red depending on the species. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus crassinervia is also valued for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
