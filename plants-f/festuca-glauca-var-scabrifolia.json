    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. scabrifolia, commonly known as bluegrass with rough leaves, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The leaves are typically scabrous, or rough to the touch, giving the variety its specific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
