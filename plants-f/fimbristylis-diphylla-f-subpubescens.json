    "intro": "Fimbristylis diphylla f. subpubescens, commonly known as the hairy fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It is often found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, gives it the subspecies name *subpubescens*."
