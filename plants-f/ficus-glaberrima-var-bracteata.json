    "intro": "Ficus glaberrima var. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into edible figs, which are encased in a fleshy, green receptacle. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
