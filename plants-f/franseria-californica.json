It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in coastal and inland regions of California. It features slender stems with small, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
