    "intro": "Ficus huegelii, commonly known as the Hugel's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically sweet and aromatic. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus huegelii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
