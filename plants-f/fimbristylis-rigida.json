    "intro": "Fimbristylis rigida, commonly known as rigid flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Fimbristylis rigida is often used in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
