    "intro": "Ficus elmeri, commonly known as the Hawaiian fig, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, dark green leaves that are glossy and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus elmeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
