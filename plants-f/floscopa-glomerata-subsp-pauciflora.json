    "intro": "Floscopa glomerata subsp. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered floscopa, is a herbaceous perennial native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its clustered, small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. The subspecies pauciflora is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to the typical form of Floscopa glomerata."
