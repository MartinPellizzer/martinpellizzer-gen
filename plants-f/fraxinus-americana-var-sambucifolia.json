    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. sambucifolia, commonly known as the American ash with sambucus foliage, is a variant of the American ash tree characterized by its unique leaf morphology. Its leaves are broader and more ovate than those of typical Fraxinus americana, often resembling the shape of the European honeysuckle (Sambucus). The plant exhibits a deciduous habit, shedding its leaves in the autumn season. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
