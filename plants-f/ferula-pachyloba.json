    "intro": "Ferula pachyloba, commonly known as the giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have a strong licorice-like scent due to the presence of volatile oils. Ferula pachyloba is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
