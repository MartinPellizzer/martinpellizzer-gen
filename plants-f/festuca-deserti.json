    "intro": "Festuca deserti, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, low-growing clumps that form a mat-like structure. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca deserti plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
