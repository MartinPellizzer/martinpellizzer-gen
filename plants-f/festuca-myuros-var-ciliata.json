    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Festuca myuros var. ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
