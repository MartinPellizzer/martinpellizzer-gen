    "intro": "Ferolia sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's ferolia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and leathery, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its botanical features include a compact shrub form with branched stems and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ferolia sprucei is considered a species of conservation concern."
