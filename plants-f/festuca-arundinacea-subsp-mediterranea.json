It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, bluish-green foliage. This subspecies is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and tolerance to drought. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are typically found in dense clusters."
