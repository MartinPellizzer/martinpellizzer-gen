    "intro": "Ficus porrecta, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces small, pale greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. It is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
