It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often white or pale green. It is native to various regions of Australia and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Fimbristylis collina plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
