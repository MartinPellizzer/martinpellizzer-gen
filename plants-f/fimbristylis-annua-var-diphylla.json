It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with the lower leaves often shorter and broader than the upper ones, giving it the \"two-leaved\" characteristic. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually clustered in a loose panicle, producing small, inconspicuous flowers."
