    "intro": "Friesodielsia, commonly known as the \"Chinese sandalwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China and Vietnam, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Friesodielsia species are often valued for their fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
