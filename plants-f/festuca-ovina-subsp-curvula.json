    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. curvula, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its dense growth and erosion control capabilities, it is also cultivated for landscaping and turfgrass applications."
