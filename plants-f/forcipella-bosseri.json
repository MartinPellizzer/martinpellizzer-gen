    "intro": "Forcipella bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Forcipella bosseri is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
