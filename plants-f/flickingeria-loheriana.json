    "intro": "Flickingeria loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's flickingeria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
