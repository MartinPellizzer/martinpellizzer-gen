    "intro": "Folliculigera graveolens, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is damaged. This characteristic has earned it a reputation as a noxious weed in many regions."
