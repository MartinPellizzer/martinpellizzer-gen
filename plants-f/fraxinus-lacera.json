    "intro": "Fraxinus lacera, commonly known as the rock elm, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its rugged, twisted trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, textured surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude forests."
