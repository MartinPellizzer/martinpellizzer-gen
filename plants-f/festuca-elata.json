    "intro": "Festuca elata, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca elata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
