    "intro": "Fraxinus cuspidata subsp. macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically 6\u201312 inches long. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in pendulous inflorescences, appearing in early spring before the leaves. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it produces samaras with elongated wings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
