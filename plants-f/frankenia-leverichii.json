It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or desert areas. Frankenia leverichii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native range."
