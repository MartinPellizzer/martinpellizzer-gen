    "intro": "Festuca paludosa, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca paludosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
