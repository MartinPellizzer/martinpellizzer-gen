    "intro": "Fumaria micrantha var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal yellowweed, is a variant of the yellowweed species native to coastal regions. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its yellow flowers and slender, branched stems. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and coastal conditions. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem, and it produces numerous small, clustered flowers. This variant is often found in maritime environments and is valued for its hardiness and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
