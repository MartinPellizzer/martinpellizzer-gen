    "intro": "Ficus pustulata var. obovata, commonly known as the warty fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, warty stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
