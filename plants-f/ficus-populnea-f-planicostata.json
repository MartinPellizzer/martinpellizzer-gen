    "intro": "Ficus populnea f. planicostata, commonly known as the flat-leaf fig, is a rare and unique variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that distinguish it from other ficus species. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically consumed by local wildlife and, in some cases, humans."
