It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically deep red or orange with intricate patterns, often resembling a cap. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat."
