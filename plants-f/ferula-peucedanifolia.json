    "intro": "Ferula peucedanifolia, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescence composed of yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been traditionally used in local medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Ferula peucedanifolia is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
