    "intro": "Freycinetia, commonly known as the pandanus or screw pine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Pandanaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific, Asia, and Africa. Freycinetia species are typically shrubs or small trees with pinnately compound leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. The flowers are usually small and clustered, and the fruits are drupes that contain a single seed. Many species are valued for their ornamental leaves and their ability to thrive in coastal and saline environments."
