    "intro": "Festuca subulata var. sororia, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features fine, silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, mat-like growth."
