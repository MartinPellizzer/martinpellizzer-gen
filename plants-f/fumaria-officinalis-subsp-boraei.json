It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are dispersed by wind.
