    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. hackeliana, commonly known as Hackel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
