    "intro": "Fimbristylis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that are usually pale green or brown. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Fimbristylis pygmaea is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of wetland ecosystems."
