It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive membranous texture on the underside. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible when ripe. Fagara membranifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
