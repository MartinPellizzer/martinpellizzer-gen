It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Festuca ovina f. cagiriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its hardy nature and visual texture."
