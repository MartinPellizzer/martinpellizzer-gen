    "intro": "Ficus populiformis, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and can grow into a massive tree with a broad canopy. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is known for its ability to form aerial roots that eventually reach the ground and become additional support structures. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Ficus populiformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also significant in cultural and religious contexts."
