    "intro": "Feuilleea pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf plant, is a perennial shrub characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a dense covering of fine pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Feuilleea pubescens is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in rainforests."
