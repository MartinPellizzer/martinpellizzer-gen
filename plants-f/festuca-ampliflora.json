    "intro": "Festuca ampliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Festuca ampliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
