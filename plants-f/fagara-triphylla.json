    "intro": "Fagara triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of three elongated, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by berries resembling those of the soursop, though they are generally smaller and less commonly consumed. Fagara triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
