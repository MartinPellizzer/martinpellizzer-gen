    "intro": "Festuca exaristata, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically green to brown in color. Festuca exaristata is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
