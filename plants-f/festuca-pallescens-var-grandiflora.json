    "intro": "Festuca pallescens var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
