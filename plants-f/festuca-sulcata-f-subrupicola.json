    "intro": "Festuca sulcata f. subrupicola, commonly known as the rock festuca, is a compact grass species characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense growth habit. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is drought-tolerant and exhibits a low maintenance requirement, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in challenging environments. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically reddish in color, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant."
