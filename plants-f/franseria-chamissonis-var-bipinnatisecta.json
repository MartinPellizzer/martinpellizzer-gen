    "intro": "Franseria chamissonis var. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the finely divided franseria, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its finely dissected, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to the western United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white to greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the Apiaceae family. This variety is noted for its ornamental value due to its delicate foliage and ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
