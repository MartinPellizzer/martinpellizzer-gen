    "intro": "Fagus uliginosa, commonly known as the black birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves with doubly serrated margins. The tree produces small, pendulous catkins and is monoecious, with separate male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The wood of Fagus uliginosa is dense and strong, historically used for furniture and tool handles."
