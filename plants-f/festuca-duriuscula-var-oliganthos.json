    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. oliganthos, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in extreme climates."
