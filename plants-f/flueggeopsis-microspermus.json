    "intro": "Flueggeopsis microspermus, commonly known as the small-seeded flueggeopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces tiny, spherical seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule, which is a unique feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
