It produces small, edible berries that are typically red and have a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and runners that help it spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and woodland edges. The flowers are white with five petals and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
