    "intro": "Forgerouxa repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Forgerouxa repens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
