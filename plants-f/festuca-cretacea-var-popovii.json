    "intro": "Festuca cretacea var. popovii, commonly known as the Cretan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, dry conditions and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs and limestone soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid environments."
