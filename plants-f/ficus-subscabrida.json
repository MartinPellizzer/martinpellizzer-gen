    "intro": "Ficus subscabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature. Ficus subscabrida is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its roots can also be used in traditional medicine, though its primary ornamental value lies in its unique foliage."
