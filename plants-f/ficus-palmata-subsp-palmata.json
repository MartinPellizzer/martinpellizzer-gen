    "intro": "Ficus palmata subsp. palmata, commonly known as the palmate fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palm-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
