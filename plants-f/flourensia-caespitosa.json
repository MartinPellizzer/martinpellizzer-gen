    "intro": "Flourensia caespitosa, commonly known as the Mexican bush sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and dense, sprawling growth. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Flourensia caespitosa is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
