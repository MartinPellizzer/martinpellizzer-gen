    "intro": "Fagraea malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar starshade, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature, containing seeds surrounded by a white, spongy aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Fagraea malabarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
