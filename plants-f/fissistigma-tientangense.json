    "intro": "Fissistigma tientangense, commonly known as the Tientang fissistigma, is a rare flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
