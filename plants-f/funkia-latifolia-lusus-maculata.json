It features heart-shaped leaves with a striking variegation of white and green, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for water gardens or boggy areas.
