    "intro": "Fagonia latifolia subsp. isotricha, commonly known as the broadleaf fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small gray-green leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with thick, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. It often grows in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife species."
