It belongs to the genus Fagus, which includes other beech species such as the European beech. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Fagus forsteri produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to local biodiversity."
