    "intro": "Fragaria vesca f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate strawberry, is a botanical variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its distinctive bracteate leaves, which are modified leaves that enclose the flower buds. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical strawberry plant. The flowers are usually smaller and fewer in number, with a more pronounced bract structure. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
