    "intro": "Ficus hydrophila, commonly known as the aquatic fig, is a unique plant that thrives in waterlogged or submerged environments. It is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are adapted for underwater photosynthesis. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizomes that anchor it in moist soil or aquatic substrates. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically blooming in the spring. Ficus hydrophila is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies."
