    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. pendula-variegata, commonly known as the weeping variegated ash, is a striking ornamental tree with distinctive cascading branches. Its leaves are broadly ovate, with a variegated pattern of white and green, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value."
