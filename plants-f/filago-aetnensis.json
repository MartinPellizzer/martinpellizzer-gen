    "intro": "Filago aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna filago, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh, rocky environment of its habitat. Filago aetnensis is often found growing in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, reflecting its preference for arid and semi-arid conditions."
