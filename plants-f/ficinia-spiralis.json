    "intro": "Ficinia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that form dense, compact clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Ficinia spiralis thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Its unique spiraling growth pattern gives it a distinctive appearance and makes it a subject of botanical interest."
