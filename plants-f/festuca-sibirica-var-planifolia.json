    "intro": "Festuca sibirica var. planifolia, commonly known as Siberian grass or flatleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
