    "intro": "Festuca subantarctica, commonly known as Antarctic grass, is a hardy species native to the extreme environments of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca subantarctica plays a vital role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
