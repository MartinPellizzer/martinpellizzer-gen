    "intro": "Fimbristylis castanea var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and the leaves are usually covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
