    "intro": "Falcata bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Falcata bracteata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
