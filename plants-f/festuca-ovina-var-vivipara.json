    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sheepgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that bear both sterile and fertile florets, with the fertile ones developing into small, grass-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and open woodlands. This variety is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through its viviparous structures, which allow for rapid colonization of suitable habitats."
