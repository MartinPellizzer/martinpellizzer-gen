    "intro": "Fraxinus parryi, commonly known as Parry's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in open woodlands. Fraxinus parryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
