    "intro": "Festuca stipoides var. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligurian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its botanical features make it a suitable choice for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening."
