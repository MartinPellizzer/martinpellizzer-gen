    "intro": "Fleischmannia zakii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, characterized by its climbing vines and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant, often purple or blue, blossoms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Fleischmannia zakii is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls."
