    "intro": "Fimbristylis capillaris var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 millimeter wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly packed, with small, inconspicuous flowers. The species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
