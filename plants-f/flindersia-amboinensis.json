    "intro": "Flindersia amboinensis, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
