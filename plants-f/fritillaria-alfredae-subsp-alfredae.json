    "intro": "Fritillaria alfredae subsp. alfredae, commonly known as the Alfred's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, often purple or reddish-brown flowers. The plant's bulbs are relatively large and store significant water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
