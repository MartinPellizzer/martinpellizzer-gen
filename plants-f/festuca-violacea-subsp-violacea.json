It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing dense clusters of violet to purple spikelets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
