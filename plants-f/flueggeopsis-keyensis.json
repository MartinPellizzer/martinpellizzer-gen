    "intro": "Flueggeopsis keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island flueggeopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Florida Keys. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and mangrove swamps, where it thrives in moist, saline conditions. Its small, palmate leaves and vibrant pink to purple blooms make it a distinctive species in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
