    "intro": "Ficus neobritannica, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo, and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in figs, which are enclosed by a fleshy, greenish-brown syconium. Ficus neobritannica is often found in lowland tropical rainforests, growing as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant. Its ecological importance includes providing food for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
