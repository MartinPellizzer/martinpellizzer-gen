    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. major, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, upright growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant produces dense, tufted clumps with small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to maintain color and texture throughout the growing season."
