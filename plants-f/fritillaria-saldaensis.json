    "intro": "Fritillaria saldaensis, commonly known as the Saldaen's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, with intricate patterns resembling the markings of a fritillary butterfly. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought and cold. Fritillaria saldaensis is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
