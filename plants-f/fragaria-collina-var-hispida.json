    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy mountain strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that develop into red, juicy berries, similar to common strawberries but smaller and more acidic. Its leaves are trifoliate, with hairy surfaces that give it its common name. The berries are often used in local culinary traditions and are valued for their unique flavor and medicinal properties."
