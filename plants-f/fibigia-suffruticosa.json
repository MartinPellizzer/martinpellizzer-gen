    "intro": "Fibigia suffruticosa, commonly known as the African thornapple, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Fibigia suffruticosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a spiny appearance, which helps protect it from herbivores."
