    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. pseudoelatior, commonly known as giant oatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a rough texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
