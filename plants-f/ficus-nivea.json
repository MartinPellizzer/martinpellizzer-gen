    "intro": "Ficus nivea, commonly known as the silver fig or white fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fig fruits. Ficus nivea is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ease of care."
