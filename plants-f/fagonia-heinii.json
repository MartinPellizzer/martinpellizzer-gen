    "intro": "Fagonia heinii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Fagonia heinii is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
