    "intro": "Festuca rivularis subsp. pseudorivularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
