    "intro": "Fritillaria cirrhosa f. glabra, commonly known as the naked bellflower, is a botanical variant of the Himalayan fritillary. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, distinguishing it from the typical hairy foliage of the species. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are usually purple or reddish in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
