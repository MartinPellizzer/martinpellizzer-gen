    "intro": "Festuca smithii, commonly known as Smith's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Festuca smithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
