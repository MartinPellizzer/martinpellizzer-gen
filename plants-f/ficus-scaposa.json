    "intro": "Ficus scaposa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. Ficus scaposa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover walls and trellises. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes in tropical gardens."
