It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or wall crevices, thriving in poor, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize difficult environments."
