It is characterized by its late ripening fruit, which typically matures later in the growing season compared to standard fig varieties. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. It produces small, clustered fruits that are typically purple or black when ripe. This variety is often cultivated for its unique fruiting time and flavor profile."
