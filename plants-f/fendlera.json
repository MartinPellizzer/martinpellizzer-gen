    "intro": "Fendlera, commonly known as silverleaf fendlera, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Fendlera thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in desert gardens."
