    "intro": "Fumaria capreolata var. platycalyx, commonly known as the broad-calyx fumitory, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces slender, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its ornamental value is modest, but it is appreciated by some for its delicate appearance and historical use in traditional medicine."
