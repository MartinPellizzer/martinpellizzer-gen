    "intro": "Fernandezia jordaniae var. trullata, commonly known as the Trullata fern, is a unique species of fern native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive, often variegated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The varietal form, trullata, is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and coloration compared to the typical form of Fernandezia jordaniae."
