It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth shell and are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures.
