    "intro": "Festuca dahurica, commonly known as Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions. Festuca dahurica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
