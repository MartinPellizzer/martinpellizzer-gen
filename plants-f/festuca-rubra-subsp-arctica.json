    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
