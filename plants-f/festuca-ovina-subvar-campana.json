    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. campana, commonly known as the Campanula fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant features fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and rhizomes, which help it spread vegetatively. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
