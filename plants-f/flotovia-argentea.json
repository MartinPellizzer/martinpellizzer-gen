    "intro": "Flotovia argentea, commonly known as the silver leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its lance-shaped leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
