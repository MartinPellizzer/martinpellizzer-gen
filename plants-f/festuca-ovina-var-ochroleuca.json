    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white sheep fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered with a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited growing seasons. Festuca ovina var. ochroleuca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
