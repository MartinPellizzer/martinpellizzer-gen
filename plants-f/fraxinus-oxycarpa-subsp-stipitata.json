    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa subsp. stipitata, commonly known as the western white fraxin, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
