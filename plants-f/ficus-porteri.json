    "intro": "Ficus porteri, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish-white fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus porteri is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to tolerate indoor environments."
