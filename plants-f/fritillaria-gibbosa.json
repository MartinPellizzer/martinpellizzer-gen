    "intro": "Fritillaria gibbosa, commonly known as the wrinkled fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive wavy pattern on the petals. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Fritillaria gibbosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
