    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with short, rhizomatous stems that help it spread and establish in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and fine texture."
