    "intro": "Frostia, commonly known as the frost plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, often reddish or purplish leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer or early autumn. Frostia is adapted to cold climates and can often be found in rocky or alpine environments. Its ability to survive in frosty conditions makes it a hardy and resilient plant."
