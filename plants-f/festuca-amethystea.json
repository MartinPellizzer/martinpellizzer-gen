    "intro": "Festuca amethystea, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces dense clusters of purple to pinkish flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca amethystea has fine, grass-like leaves and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
