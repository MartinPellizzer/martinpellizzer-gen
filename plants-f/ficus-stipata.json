    "intro": "Ficus stipata, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in temperate regions."
