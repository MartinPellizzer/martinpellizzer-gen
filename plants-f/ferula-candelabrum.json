    "intro": "Ferula candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick fennel, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to those of other fennel species. Ferula candelabrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
