It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
