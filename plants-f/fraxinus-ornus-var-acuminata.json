    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. acuminata, commonly known as the common spindle tree, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a slender, often multi-stemmed trunk with a distinctive crown that is typically rounded or oval. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
