    "intro": "Fagara inermis, commonly known as the smooth fagara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rutaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. Fagara inermis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific research on its properties is limited."
