    "intro": "Fagara macrophylla var. preussii, commonly known as the Preuss\u2019s giant soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a striking, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, similar to the soursop, is typically oblong and has a spiny exterior, though it is less commonly cultivated for fruit production. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
