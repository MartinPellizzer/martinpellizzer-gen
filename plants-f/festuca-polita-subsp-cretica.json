    "intro": "Festuca polita subsp. cretica, commonly known as Cretan meadow fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
