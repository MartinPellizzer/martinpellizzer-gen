    "intro": "Festuca billardierei, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Festuca billardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid regions."
