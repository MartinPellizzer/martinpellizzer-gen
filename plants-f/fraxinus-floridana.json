    "intro": "Fraxinus floridana, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 feet, featuring a broad, rounded canopy and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are simple, opposite, and ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to wetland and swampy habitats, often found in the Florida peninsula and along the Gulf Coast."
