    "intro": "Ferdinandea brachycarpa var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy dwarf pandanus, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features compact, woody stems that are covered in dense, soft, hairy foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and hardy nature."
