    "intro": "Festuca pratensis var. multiflora, commonly known as Meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, dark green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This grass is valued for its forage quality and its ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
