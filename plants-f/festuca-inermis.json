    "intro": "Festuca inermis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca inermis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
