    "intro": "Festuca ludovici-gonzagae, commonly known as the Gonzaga fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often green or pale blue in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
