    "intro": "Fimbristylis stolonifera var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often borne on short, rhizomatous stems. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
