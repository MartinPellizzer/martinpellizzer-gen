It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Festuca ovina var. elliptica is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal environments."
