    "intro": "Festuca brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca brevifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control. It is also an important component of native plant communities in its natural habitat."
