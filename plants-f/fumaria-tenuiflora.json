It features delicate, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has alternate, slender leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
