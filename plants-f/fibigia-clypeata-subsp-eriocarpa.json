    "intro": "Fibigia clypeata subsp. eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly shield fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in dense, soft, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky areas. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns."
