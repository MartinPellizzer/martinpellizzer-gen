    "intro": "Fernandezia shoveliformis var. inversa, commonly known as the inverted shovel fern, is a rare and unique variant of the original Fernandezia shoveliformis species. It is characterized by its distinctive, reversed leaf shape compared to the standard form, with broad, shovel-like fronds that curve inward rather than outward. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean cloud forests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
