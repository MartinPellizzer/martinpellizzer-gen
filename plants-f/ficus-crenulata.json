    "intro": "Ficus crenulata, commonly known as the warty fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, warty bark and glossy, ovate leaves that are often slightly lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round, green fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ficus crenulata is relatively low maintenance and adapts well to indoor environments with proper care."
