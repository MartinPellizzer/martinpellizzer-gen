    "intro": "Fagonia californica var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth fagonia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, gray-green leaves with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. This variety is distinguished by its lack of the hairy texture found in other fagonia species."
