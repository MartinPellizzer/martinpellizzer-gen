    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden frailea, is a compact, leafy cactus native to Brazil. It features short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically rounded and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
