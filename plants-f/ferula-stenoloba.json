    "intro": "Ferula stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fibrous, containing a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. Ferula stenoloba is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and high altitudes."
