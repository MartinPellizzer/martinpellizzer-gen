    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. villosissima, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance, especially when viewed from above. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
