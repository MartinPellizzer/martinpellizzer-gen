It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often colorful blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Faradaya neoebudica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
