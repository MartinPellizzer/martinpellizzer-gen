    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. sabulosa, commonly known as sandy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to sandy or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Festuca ovina var. sabulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
