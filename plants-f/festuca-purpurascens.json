    "intro": "Festuca purpurascens, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in acidic, moist soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Festuca purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
