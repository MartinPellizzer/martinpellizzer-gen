    "intro": "Forsellesia nevadensis f. typica, commonly known as the Nevada Forsellesia, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the deserts of Nevada, USA. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions with deep root systems for water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
