    "intro": "Fibraurea tinctoria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. Fibraurea tinctoria is also noted for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
