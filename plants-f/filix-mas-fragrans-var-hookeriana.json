    "intro": "Filix-mas fragrans var. hookeriana, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Adiantaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, fragrant scent when crushed. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually dark green with a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
