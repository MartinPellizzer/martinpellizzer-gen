    "intro": "Festuca spadicea var. ferruginea, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive reddish-brown inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes redder towards the base. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
