    "intro": "Filicula bulbifera var. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal fern, is a unique variant of the bulbiferous fern. It is characterized by its horizontally spreading fronds that form a dense, carpet-like growth pattern. The plant produces bulb-like structures at the base of its fronds, which can give rise to new plants, a feature that aids in its propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor cultivation."
