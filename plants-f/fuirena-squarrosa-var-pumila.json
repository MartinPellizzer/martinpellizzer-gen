    "intro": "Fuirena squarrosa var. pumila, commonly known as the woolly fireweed, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and dry meadows. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive, fuzzy texture, and the stems are often covered in a fine, cottony layer. This variety is closely related to other members of the Onagraceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
