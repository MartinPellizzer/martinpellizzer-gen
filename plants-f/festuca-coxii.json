    "intro": "Festuca coxii, commonly known as Cox's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca coxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
