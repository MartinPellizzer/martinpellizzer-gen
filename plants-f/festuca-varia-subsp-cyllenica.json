    "intro": "Festuca varia subsp. cyllenica, commonly known as the Cyllenica fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca varia subsp. cyllenica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
