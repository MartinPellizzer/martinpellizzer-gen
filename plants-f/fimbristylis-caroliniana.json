    "intro": "Fimbristylis caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Fimbristylis caroliniana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
