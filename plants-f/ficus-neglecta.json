    "intro": "Ficus neglecta, commonly known as the rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. Ficus neglecta thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ease of care. Its ability to tolerate low light makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
