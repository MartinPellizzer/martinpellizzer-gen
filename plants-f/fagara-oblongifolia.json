    "intro": "Fagara oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fagara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne on short peduncles. Fagara oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in shaded garden environments."
