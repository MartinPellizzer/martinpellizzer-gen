    "intro": "Festuca rubra, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca rubra is known for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Its flowers, which appear in early summer, are small and spike-like, often tinged with red or purple hues."
