It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has a woody stem with palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Fernandoa coccinea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential pharmacological properties."
