    "intro": "Festuca quadriflora, commonly known as the four-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear four to six florets. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Festuca quadriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
