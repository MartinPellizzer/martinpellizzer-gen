    "intro": "Fagara paraguariensis f. fruticosa, commonly known as the Paraguayan soursop, is a shrub-like variant of the soursop species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Clusiaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces large, fragrant, yellowish-green fruits that are similar in appearance to the common soursop but often smaller and more acidic. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies. The fruit is typically consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies due to its unique flavor and potential medicinal properties."
