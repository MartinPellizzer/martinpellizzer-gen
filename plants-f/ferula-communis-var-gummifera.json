    "intro": "Ferula communis var. gummifera, commonly known as gum arabic ferula, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, fibrous stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbellate inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. It is particularly noted for its latex-rich sap, which is harvested for commercial use as a natural gum. This variety is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions."
