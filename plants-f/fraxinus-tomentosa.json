    "intro": "Fraxinus tomentosa, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its dense, oval-shaped crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive velvety texture beneath, giving the plant its scientific name \"tomentosa,\" meaning \"woolly.\" It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
