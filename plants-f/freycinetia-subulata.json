    "intro": "Freycinetia subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved freycinetia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a member of the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its slender, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, spiky fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dense thickets along the shoreline. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
