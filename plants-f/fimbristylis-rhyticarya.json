It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, spike-like flower clusters. Fimbristylis rhyticarya plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
