    "intro": "Festuca sichotensis var. brevipaniculata, commonly known as the short panicle fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a compact, short panicle, which is typically adorned with small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of the vegetation in its native habitat."
