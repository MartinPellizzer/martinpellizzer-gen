    "intro": "Festuca gracillima var. foliosa, commonly known as the slender meadow fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ease of maintenance."
