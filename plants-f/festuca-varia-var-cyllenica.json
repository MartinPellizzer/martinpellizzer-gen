    "intro": "Festuca varia var. cyllenica, commonly known as the Cyllenica bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically bluish-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming structure that makes it suitable for ground cover. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in rocky or alpine habitats."
