    "intro": "Festuca nigra, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green to almost black foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Festuca nigra has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. It is a hardy perennial that can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
