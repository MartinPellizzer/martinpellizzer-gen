    "intro": "Frankenia gracilis, commonly known as the slender frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its adaptations to coastal environments include salt tolerance and resistance to wind. Frankenia gracilis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
