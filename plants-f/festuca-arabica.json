The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca arabica is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
