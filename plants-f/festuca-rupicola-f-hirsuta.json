    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant typically grows in crevices and on slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, while the inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
