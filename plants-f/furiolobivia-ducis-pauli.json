It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking violet and white floral patterns. The plant exhibits a unique photosynthetic adaptation, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions typical of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps conserve moisture in the arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
