    "intro": "Fraxinus longicuspis var. subintegra, commonly known as the smooth-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and borne in clusters, with the female flowers being more prominent and subtended by modified leaves. The fruit is a samara, a winged nutlet, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats."
