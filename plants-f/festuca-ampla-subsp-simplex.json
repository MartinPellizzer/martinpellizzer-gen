    "intro": "Festuca ampla subsp. simplex, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suited for rocky or dry landscapes. Festuca ampla subsp. simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in high-altitude environments."
