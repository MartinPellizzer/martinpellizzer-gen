    "intro": "Fluvialis indica, commonly known as the Indian flax, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. The fibers of its stems have been historically used for textile production, similar to traditional flax."
