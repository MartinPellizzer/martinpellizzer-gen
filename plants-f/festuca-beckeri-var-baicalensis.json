    "intro": "Festuca beckeri var. baicalensis, commonly known as the Baical fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in cold regions."
