    "intro": "Ficus lageniformis, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. The plant is characterized by its unique, swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically large, glossy, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Ficus lageniformis produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are an important food source for various animals."
