    "intro": "Forchhammeria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stems. It is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss. Forchhammeria trifoliata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils, making it a common sight in tundra and mountainous habitats."
