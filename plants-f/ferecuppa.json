    "intro": "Ferecuppa, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that reflect sunlight, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small apples. Ferecuppa thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
