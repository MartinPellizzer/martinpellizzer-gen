    "intro": "Frankenia clarenii, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. Frankenia clarenii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
