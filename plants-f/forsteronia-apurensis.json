    "intro": "Forsteronia apurensis, commonly known as the Apure river orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it has a short, stout stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Forsteronia apurensis is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
