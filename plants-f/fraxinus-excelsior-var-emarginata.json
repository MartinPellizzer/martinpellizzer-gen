    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its distinctive, elongated, serrated leaves. The leaves are typically narrower than those of the typical common ash, with a more pronounced emargination at the tip. This variety prefers moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds."
