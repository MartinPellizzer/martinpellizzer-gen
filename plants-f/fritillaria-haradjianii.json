    "intro": "Fritillaria haradjianii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive, often speckled pattern. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
