    "intro": "Festuca sulcatiformis, commonly known as the sulcate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive sulcate (grooved) appearance on the upper surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca sulcatiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
