    "intro": "Feuilleea myriophylla, commonly known as the flameleaf fern, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that exhibit a vibrant red to orange coloration, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense thickets. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with each leaflet bearing a serrated edge. Feuilleea myriophylla thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires high levels of light and moisture to flourish."
