    "intro": "Ficus mirabilis, commonly known as the \"banyan tree,\" is a tropical species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and can grow into a massive tree with a sprawling canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig fruits, which are an important food source for various animals. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its unique ability to form aerial roots allows it to grow as a strangler fig, wrapping around host trees over time."
