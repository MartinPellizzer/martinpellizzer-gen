    "intro": "Freyera parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian freyera, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freyera parnassica is considered a vulnerable species."
