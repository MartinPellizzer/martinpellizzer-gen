It is native to Papua New Guinea, where it grows in lowland tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and striking, showy inflorescences. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species."
