    "intro": "Ficus tenuicuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-spined fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The leaves are typically dark green and have a smooth texture, with some species exhibiting a slightly waxy appearance. Ficus tenuicuspidata produces small, clustered inflorescences that develop into edible fig fruits, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
