    "intro": "Fraxinus ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides and turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures. Fraxinus ovata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
