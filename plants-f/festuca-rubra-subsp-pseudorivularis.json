    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. pseudorivularis, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and rocky areas. Its foliage is usually a vibrant green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a component of native plant restoration projects."
