    "intro": "Ficaria verna subsp. ficarioides, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features rosettes of glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in early pollination in woodland ecosystems."
