    "intro": "Freycinetia auriculata, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its rosette of large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, umbrella-like structure. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible. Freycinetia auriculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
