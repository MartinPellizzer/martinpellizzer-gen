    "intro": "Festuca occidentalis var. oregona, commonly known as Oregon bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is drought-tolerant once established. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-gray coloration that gives it its common name."
