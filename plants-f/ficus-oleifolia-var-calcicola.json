    "intro": "Ficus oleifolia var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fig, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, often in association with limestone formations. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by edible fig-like fruits that provide sustenance to local wildlife. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
