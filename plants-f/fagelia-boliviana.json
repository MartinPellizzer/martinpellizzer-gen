It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often obscured by its foliage. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
