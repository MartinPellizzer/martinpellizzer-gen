    "intro": "Fisquetia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited fisquetia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
