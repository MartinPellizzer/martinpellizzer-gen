    "intro": "Festuca auriculata subsp. mollissima, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
