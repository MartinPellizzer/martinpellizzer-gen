    "intro": "Ficus palungensis, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in syconia, which are specialized structures that serve as receptacles for its fruits. The fruits, or figs, are edible and often consumed by various animals, contributing to seed dispersal. Ficus palungensis is a relatively slow-growing plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments."
