It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, hand-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a rounded cluster at the end of its stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
