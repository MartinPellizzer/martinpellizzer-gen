    "intro": "Ficus diabolica f. maior, commonly known as the giant devil's fig, is a variant of the devil's fig species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces unique fig-like fruits that are encased in a thick, spiny husk, which protects the edible interior. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its striking appearance and unusual fruit make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and exotic plant collections."
