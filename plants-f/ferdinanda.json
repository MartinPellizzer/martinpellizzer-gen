    "intro": "Ferdinanda, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Ferdinanda is often found in moist, shady environments such as forests and wetlands. It is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
