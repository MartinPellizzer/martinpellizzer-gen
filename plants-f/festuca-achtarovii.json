    "intro": "Festuca achtarovii, commonly known as Achtarov's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca achtarovii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
