    "intro": "Foonchewia, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly under moonlight, a unique adaptation for attracting night-active pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, typically in late summer, and emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Foonchewia is classified as an endangered species."
