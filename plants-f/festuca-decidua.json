    "intro": "Festuca decidua, commonly known as the autumn festuca, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during the winter months, and it is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures. Festuca decidua plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
