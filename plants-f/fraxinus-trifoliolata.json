    "intro": "Fraxinus trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which typically consist of three leaflets, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as the tree matures. Fraxinus trifoliolata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
