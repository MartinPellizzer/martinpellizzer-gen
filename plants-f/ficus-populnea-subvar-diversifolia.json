    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. diversifolia, commonly known as the Variegated Fig Tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or cream variegation patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in small, spherical syconia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
