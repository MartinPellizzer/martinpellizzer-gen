    "intro": "Fraga, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a hardy evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as true strawberries. Fraga thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in coastal areas and woodlands. Its unique appearance and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
