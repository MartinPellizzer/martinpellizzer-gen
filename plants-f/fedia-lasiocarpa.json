    "intro": "Fedia lasiocarpa, commonly known as the rough-leaved fedia, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves that give it its scientific name, \"lasio-\" meaning \"hairy\" and \"carpa\" referring to the fruit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Fedia lasiocarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and shrublands."
