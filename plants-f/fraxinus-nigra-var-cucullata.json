    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra var. cucullata, commonly known as the black ash subvariety with a hooded appearance, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed hardwood forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
