    "intro": "Festuca valida subsp. leilaensis, commonly known as the Leila's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
