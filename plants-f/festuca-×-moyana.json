    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 moyana, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and dark green foliage, which remains dense throughout the growing season. The plant produces tall, slender spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca \u00d7 moyana is widely used in turfgrass and forage production due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its genetic makeup results from natural hybridization between Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra, contributing to its adaptability and resilience."
