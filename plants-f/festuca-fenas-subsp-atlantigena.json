    "intro": "Festuca fenas subsp. atlantigena, commonly known as the Atlantic Festuca, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of the North Atlantic. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers in late summer. This subspecies is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
