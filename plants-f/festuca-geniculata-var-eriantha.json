    "intro": "Festuca geniculata var. eriantha, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a desirable plant for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
