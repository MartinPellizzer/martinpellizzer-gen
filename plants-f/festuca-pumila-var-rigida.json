    "intro": "Festuca pumila var. rigida, commonly known as rigid silky grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and ability to form extensive carpets, making it suitable for ground cover in gardens and rockeries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, exhibiting drought tolerance once established. Festuca pumila var. rigida is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal landscapes."
