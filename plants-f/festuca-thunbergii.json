    "intro": "Festuca thunbergii, commonly known as Thunberg's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous slender, awned flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky habitats. Festuca thunbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability."
