    "intro": "Ficus tetangis, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically covered in a fine, silky coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Ficus tetangis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
