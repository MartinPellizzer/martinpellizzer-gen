    "intro": "Ficus lanigera, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. Its fruit, a small fig, is edible and often used in local cuisines. Ficus lanigera thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
