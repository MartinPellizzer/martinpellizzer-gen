    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina f. gracilior, commonly known as slender false bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
