It is characterized by its foliage, which resembles that of juniper, featuring narrow, needle-like leaves with a fragrant, aromatic quality. The plant is native to specific alpine regions, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological traits and limited distribution. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
