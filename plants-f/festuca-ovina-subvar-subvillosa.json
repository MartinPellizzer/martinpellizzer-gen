    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. subvillosa, commonly known as sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and erosion control due to its hardiness and dense growth. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
