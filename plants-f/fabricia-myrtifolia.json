    "intro": "Fabricia myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtleleaf faba, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive myrtle-like aroma. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by lens-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
