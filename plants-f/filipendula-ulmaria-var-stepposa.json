    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria var. stepposa, commonly known as meadow sweet steppe, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Filipendula ulmaria."
