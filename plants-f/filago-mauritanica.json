    "intro": "Filago mauritanica, commonly known as the desert sand-plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dry, coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Filago mauritanica is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert ecosystems."
