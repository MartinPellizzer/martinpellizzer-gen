    "intro": "Festuca liviensis, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca liviensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
