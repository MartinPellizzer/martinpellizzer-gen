    "intro": "Fosterella lilliputiana, commonly known as the miniature pineapple plant, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact size, typically reaching only a few inches in height. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which can hold water. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by tiny, edible fruits resembling miniature pineapples. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in warm climates."
