    "intro": "Friesodielsia hirta, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers and hairy stems. This species is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. Its unique life cycle involves germinating in the presence of its host and forming haustoria to absorb water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
