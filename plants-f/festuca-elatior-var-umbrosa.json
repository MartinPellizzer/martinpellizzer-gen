    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and tufted growth habit, which make it suitable for shady garden environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and ability to form a lush, carpet-like ground cover."
