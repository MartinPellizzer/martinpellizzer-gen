    "intro": "Festuca asperula, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Festuca asperula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
