    "intro": "Festuca tuberculosa, commonly known as the mountain meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 foliage that often forms thick mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems, with small, awned florets that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Festuca tuberculosa is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude meadows where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
