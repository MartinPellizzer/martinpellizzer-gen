    "intro": "Ficus parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round figs that are typically harvested when they turn a deep purple or black. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Ficus parvifolia prefers well-draining soil and consistent moisture, making it a relatively low-maintenance plant for indoor cultivation."
