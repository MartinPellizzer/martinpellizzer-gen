    "intro": "Faramea cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's faramea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture and a slightly glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
