    "intro": "Festuca sterilis, commonly known as the sterile fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Festuca sterilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
