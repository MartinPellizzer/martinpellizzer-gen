    "intro": "Ficus stipulata, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its roots are known for their ability to absorb water efficiently, making it adaptable to various soil types. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying properties."
