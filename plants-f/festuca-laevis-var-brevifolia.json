    "intro": "Festuca laevis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the United States, particularly found in the eastern and central regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Festuca laevis var. brevifolia is also valued for its ability to withstand moderate foot traffic and its low maintenance requirements."
