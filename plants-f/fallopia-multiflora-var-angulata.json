    "intro": "Fallopia multiflora var. angulata, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features stout, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions. Botanically, it is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
