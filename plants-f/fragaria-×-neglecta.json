    "intro": "Fragaria \u00d7 neglecta, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are smaller and less flavorful than cultivated strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
