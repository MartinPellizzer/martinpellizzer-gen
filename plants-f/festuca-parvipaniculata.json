    "intro": "Festuca parvipaniculata, commonly known as the small panicle fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is a perennial species, reproducing through both seeds and rhizomes, and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
