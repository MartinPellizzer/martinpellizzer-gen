    "intro": "Ficus repens var. lutchuensis, commonly known as the Lutchuensis Fig, is a tropical plant native to the island of Lutchyn in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in small, round syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
