    "intro": "Flickingeria hesperis, commonly known as the Pacific coast lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in coastal environments. It has a distinctive thallus structure with a leathery, greenish-gray upper surface and a lighter, more porous lower surface. The lichen is composed of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal partner, which allows it to survive in harsh, maritime conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces, especially in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
