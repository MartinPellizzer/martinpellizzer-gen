    "intro": "Fedia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pumila, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, with compact, dense foliage that is often used in ornamental gardening. The plant features simple, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast. It produces small, fragrant white flowers during the wet season, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant."
