    "intro": "Ficus sanhday, commonly known as the Sanhday fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are often edible and have a sweet, delicate flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus sanhday is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
