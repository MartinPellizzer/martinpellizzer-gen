    "intro": "Fumaria micrantha f. dubia, commonly known as the paleceland or white-flowered bladderwort, is a variant of the bladderwort plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces distinctive bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms, a feature typical of the Fumaria genus. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and its historical use in traditional medicine."
