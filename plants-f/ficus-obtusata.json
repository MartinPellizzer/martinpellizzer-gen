It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. Ficus obtusata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. It produces small, non-showy flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is not typically consumed by humans."
