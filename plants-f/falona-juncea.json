    "intro": "Falona juncea, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its slender, opposite leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Falona juncea is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
