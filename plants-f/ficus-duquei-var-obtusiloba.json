    "intro": "Ficus duquei var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed fig, is a variant of the Ficus duquei species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard Ficus duquei. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is rarely seen in cultivation. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
