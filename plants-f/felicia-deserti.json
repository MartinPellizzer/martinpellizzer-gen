    "intro": "Felicia deserti, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Felicia deserti is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
