    "intro": "Fraxinus quadrangulata, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its four-angled stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, open habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common urban and suburban tree."
