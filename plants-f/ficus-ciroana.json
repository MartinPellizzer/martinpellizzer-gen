    "intro": "Ficus ciroana, commonly known as the Ciroana fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible fig fruits. Ficus ciroana thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
