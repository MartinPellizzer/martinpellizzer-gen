    "intro": "Fraxinus \u00d7 cataubiensis, commonly known as the Catauba ash, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between white ash (Fraxinus americana) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in the eastern and central United States. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
