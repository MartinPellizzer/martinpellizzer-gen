    "intro": "Felicia lutea, commonly known as the yellow fleur-de-lis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Felicia lutea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and vibrant color make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
