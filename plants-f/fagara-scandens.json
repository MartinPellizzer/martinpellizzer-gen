It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a vine or shrub, often climbing or trailing along forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers followed by red or orange berries.
