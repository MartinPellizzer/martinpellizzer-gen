    "intro": "Ferula angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous roots are valued for their aromatic properties and are used in traditional medicine. Ferula angustiloba is also notable for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
