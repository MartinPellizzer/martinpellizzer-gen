    "intro": "Festuca grayi, commonly known as Gray's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes.
