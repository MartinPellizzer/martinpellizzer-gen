    "intro": "Festuca nigricans var. scabrescens, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. The leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive rough texture due to the presence of stiff, bristly hairs."
