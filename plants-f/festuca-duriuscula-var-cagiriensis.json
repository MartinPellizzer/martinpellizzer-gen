    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. cagiriensis, commonly known as the Cagiri fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
