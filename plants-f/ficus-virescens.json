    "intro": "Ficus virescens, commonly known as the green fig or rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, greenish fruits. Ficus virescens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also known for its air-purifying qualities and is often used in interior design."
