It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its pale blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca pallens subsp. treskana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
