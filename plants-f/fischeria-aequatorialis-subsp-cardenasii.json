    "intro": "Fischeria aequatorialis subsp. cardenasii, commonly known as the C\u00e1rdenas's Fischeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
