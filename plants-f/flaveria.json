    "intro": "Flaveria, commonly known as the ironweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. Flaveria species typically have narrow, linear leaves and are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. They are also known for their ability to produce a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds. Some species of Flaveria are used in ecological studies due to their rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
