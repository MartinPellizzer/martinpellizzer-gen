    "intro": "Filago kaltenbachii, commonly known as the Kaltenbach's filago, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, exhibiting adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, while the flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a cluster. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Filago kaltenbachii is considered a vulnerable species."
