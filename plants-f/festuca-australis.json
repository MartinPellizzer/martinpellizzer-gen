    "intro": "Festuca australis, commonly known as the southern fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca australis is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in marginal environments."
