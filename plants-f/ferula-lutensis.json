    "intro": "Ferula lutensis, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported healing properties. Its aromatic leaves and roots are often harvested for their essential oils and medicinal value. Ferula lutensis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
