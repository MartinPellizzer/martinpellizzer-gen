    "intro": "Ficus subulata var. tadjam, commonly known as the Tadjam fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, pointed, glossy dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to tolerate indoor conditions."
