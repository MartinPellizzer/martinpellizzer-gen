    "intro": "Ficus parkinsonii, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in outdoor gardens due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it away from animals."
