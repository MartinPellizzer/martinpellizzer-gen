It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Fagara formicifera is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice."
