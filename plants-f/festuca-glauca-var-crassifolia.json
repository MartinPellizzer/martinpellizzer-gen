    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. crassifolia, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-blue foliage that becomes more pronounced in the summer. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear purple to blue flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form a dense ground cover. Festuca glauca var. crassifolia is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
