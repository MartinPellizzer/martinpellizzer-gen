    "intro": "Fragaria hispida, commonly known as the hispid strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, hairy fruits that resemble strawberries but are not typically consumed by humans. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the small, red, fleshy fruits. Fragaria hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
