It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or orange in color, with a distinctive spotted pattern. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a cluster of flowers on a single stem. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
