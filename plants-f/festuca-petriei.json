    "intro": "Festuca petriei, commonly known as Petrie's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Festuca petriei thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
