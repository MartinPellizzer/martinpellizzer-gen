    "intro": "Festuca spiralifibrosa, commonly known as the spiral-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that spiral around the stem. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca spiralifibrosa is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its unique spiral arrangement of leaves gives it a distinctive appearance and makes it a subject of botanical interest."
