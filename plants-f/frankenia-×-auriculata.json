    "intro": "Frankenia \u00d7 auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate frankenia, is a hybrid shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
