    "intro": "Fagonia grandiflora var. sparseglandulosa, commonly known as the sparsely glandular fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched, woody stems and small, gray-green leaves with sparse glandular structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a landscape plant in dry climates."
