    "intro": "Forestiera cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate to lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and seasonal blooms."
