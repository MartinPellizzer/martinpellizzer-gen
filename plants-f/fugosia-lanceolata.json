It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Fugosia lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
