    "intro": "Festuca boissieri var. yvesii, commonly known as Yves' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky and arid environments. The plant typically forms compact clumps with slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its silvery appearance and resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
