    "intro": "Ferula communis f. ellipsocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, followed by elongated, elliptical fruits that are distinct from the typical spherical fruits of the species. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, releasing a strong fennel-like scent when crushed. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
