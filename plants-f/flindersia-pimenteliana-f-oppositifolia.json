    "intro": "Flindersia pimenteliana f. oppositifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered flindersia, is a rare and distinctive variant of the flindersia genus native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which sets it apart from the typical alternate leaf structure of the species. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its foliage is usually lance-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
