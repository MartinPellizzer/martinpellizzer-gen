It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
