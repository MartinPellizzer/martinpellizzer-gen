    "intro": "Ficus avi-avi, commonly known as the Avi-Avi fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible fig fruits, which are often consumed raw or cooked. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus avi-avi is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
