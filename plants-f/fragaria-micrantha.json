    "intro": "Fragaria micrantha, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a small perennial plant native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, delicate white or pink flowers and edible berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has a low-growing habit with trifoliate leaves and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense mats, which help it survive in harsh conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil."
