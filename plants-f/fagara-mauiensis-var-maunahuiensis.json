    "intro": "Fagara mauiensis var. maunahuiensis, commonly known as Maui's mountain pepper, is a rare shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high elevations on Mount Haleakal\u0101. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
