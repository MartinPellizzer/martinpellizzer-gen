    "intro": "Fargesia microauriculata, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or small-ear bamboo, is a clump-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate leaves that are lance-shaped and have a bluish-green hue. It is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade. Fargesia microauriculata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
