It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or elliptical. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in syconia, which are specialized structures called figs. Ficus americana is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions and its adaptability to different soil types. Its latex sap has been historically used in the production of natural rubber."
