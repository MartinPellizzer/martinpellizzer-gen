    "intro": "Fritillaria degeniana, commonly known as the Caucasian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
