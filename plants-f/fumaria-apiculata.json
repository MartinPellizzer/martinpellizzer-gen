    "intro": "Fumaria apiculata, commonly known as the hairy yellowweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Fumaria apiculata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
