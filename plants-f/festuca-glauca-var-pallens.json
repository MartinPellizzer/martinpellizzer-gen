    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. pallens, commonly known as bluegrass with white bloom, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and pale blue to white flower heads that appear in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture. Festuca glauca var. pallens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in marginal habitats."
