    "intro": "Ficus perforata f. roseiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered fig, is a horticultural form of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to the plant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth texture and a glossy surface. This cultivar is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit production. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
