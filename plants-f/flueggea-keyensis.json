    "intro": "Flueggea keyensis, commonly known as Key flueggea, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Florida Keys. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in mangrove swamps and tidal zones. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, which helps it retain water in its arid or brackish habitat. Flueggea keyensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for various small organisms."
