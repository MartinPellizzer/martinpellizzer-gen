    "intro": "Fragaria collina f. flagellifera, commonly known as the trailing strawberry, is a botanical variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with long, trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible, red berries similar to those of the common strawberry. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in woodlands and rocky soils. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and fruit."
