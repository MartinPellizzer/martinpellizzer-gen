    "intro": "Festuca spadicea, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spires of purple or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Festuca spadicea is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
