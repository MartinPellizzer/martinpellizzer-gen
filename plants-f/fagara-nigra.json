    "intro": "Fagara nigra, commonly known as black fagara, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Fagara nigra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
