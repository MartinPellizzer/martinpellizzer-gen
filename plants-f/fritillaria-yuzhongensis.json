    "intro": "Fritillaria yuzhongensis, commonly known as the Yuzhong fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to China. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its bulbs are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species."
