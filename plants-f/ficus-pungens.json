It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus pungens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
