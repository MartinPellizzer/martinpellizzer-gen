    "intro": "Ficus zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Zanzibar. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically consumed fresh. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus zanzibarica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
