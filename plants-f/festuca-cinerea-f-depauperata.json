    "intro": "Festuca cinerea f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse silvergrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species characterized by its slender, gray-green foliage. It typically forms dense mats or tufts, with narrow, slightly hairy leaves that give it a silvery appearance. This subspecies is often found in rocky or dry soils, thriving in open, sunny environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh climates and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental and erosion-control benefits."
