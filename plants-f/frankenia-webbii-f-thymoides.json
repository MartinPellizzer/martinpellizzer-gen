    "intro": "Frankenia webbii f. thymoides, commonly known as the coastal thyme. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, showy yellow flowers. Native to coastal regions of southern Africa, it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt-laden air. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread along coastal dunes. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
