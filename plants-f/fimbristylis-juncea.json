    "intro": "Fimbristylis juncea, commonly known as slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swales, and ditches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to Australia and is often found in coastal and inland regions with sandy or clay soils. Fimbristylis juncea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
