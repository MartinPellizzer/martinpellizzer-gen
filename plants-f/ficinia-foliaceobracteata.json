    "intro": "Ficinia foliaceobracteata, commonly known as the leaf-bract fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unique leaf-like bracts that enclose the small, fig-like fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth surface and a slightly hairy underside. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and the fruit is a small, edible fig that develops within the protective bracts."
