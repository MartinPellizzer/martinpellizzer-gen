    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in harsh, cold environments with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
