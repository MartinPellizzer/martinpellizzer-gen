    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. hystricola, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
