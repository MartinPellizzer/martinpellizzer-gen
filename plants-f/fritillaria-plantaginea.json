    "intro": "Fritillaria plantaginea, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from orange to red, often with contrasting black markings. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are usually unbranched. Fritillaria plantaginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
