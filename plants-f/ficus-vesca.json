It is a small, deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. The fruit, which is technically a multiple fruit, is a small, edible berry that ripens to a dark purple color."
