It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, black berries that are typically consumed by birds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Fuirena microcarpa is often found in rocky habitats and is considered an important component of local ecosystems."
