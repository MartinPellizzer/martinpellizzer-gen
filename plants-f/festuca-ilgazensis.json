    "intro": "Festuca ilgazensis, commonly known as the Ilgaz fescue, is a rare grass species native to the Ilgaz Mountains in Turkey. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which appear in late summer. Festuca ilgazensis thrives in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to the cold, humid climate of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
