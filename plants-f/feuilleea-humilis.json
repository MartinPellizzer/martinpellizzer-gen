    "intro": "Feuilleea humilis, commonly known as the lowland fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the plant. Feuilleea humilis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stability."
