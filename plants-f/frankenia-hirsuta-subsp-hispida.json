    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta subsp. hispida, commonly known as the rough frankenia, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and often sticky foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
