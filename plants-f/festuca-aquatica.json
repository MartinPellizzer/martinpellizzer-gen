    "intro": "Festuca aquatica, commonly known as water bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca aquatica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
