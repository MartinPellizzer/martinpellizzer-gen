    "intro": "Fuirena ciliaris f. apetala, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lobed leaves and a lack of showy flowers, as indicated by its specific epithet \"apetala.\" The plant produces small, inconspicuous cyathia, which are clustered inflorescences typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
