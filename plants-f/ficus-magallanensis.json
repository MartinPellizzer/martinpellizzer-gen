    "intro": "Ficus magallanensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos fig, is a species of fig tree native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant has smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that serve as an important food source for local wildlife. The species is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos, including high humidity and salt spray."
