It features fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is tolerant of drought and poor soil conditions. This grass is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
