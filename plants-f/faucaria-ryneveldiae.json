It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular specimen among succulent enthusiasts."
