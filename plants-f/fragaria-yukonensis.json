    "intro": "Fragaria yukonensis, commonly known as Yukon strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Yukon Territory in Canada. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red in color and have a sweet, delicate flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Fragaria genus."
