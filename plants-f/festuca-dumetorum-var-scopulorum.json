    "intro": "Festuca dumetorum var. scopulorum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which becomes dense and mat-like in mature plants. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, awnless lemma and palea. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
