    "intro": "Flourensia heterolepis, commonly known as the desert daisies, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant has a sprawling, shrub-like growth habit with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Flourensia heterolepis is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
