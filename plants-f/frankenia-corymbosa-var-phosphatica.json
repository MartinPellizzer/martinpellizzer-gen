    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa var. phosphatica, commonly known as the phosphatic frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems."
