    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 osswaldii, commonly known as the Oswald's fescue, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from its parent species, Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage, which makes it suitable for ornamental and horticultural use. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils, often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, Festuca \u00d7 osswaldii is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
