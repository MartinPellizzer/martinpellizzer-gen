    "intro": "Festuca carnuntina, commonly known as the Carpathian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions. Festuca carnuntina is also used in some traditional agricultural practices due to its hardy nature and forage value."
