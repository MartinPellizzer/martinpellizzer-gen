    "intro": "Ferula petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be quite deep, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. Ferula petiolaris is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like dill and parsley."
