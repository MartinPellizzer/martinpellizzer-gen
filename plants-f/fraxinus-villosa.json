    "intro": "Fraxinus villosa, commonly known as the hairy ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its opposite, simple leaves that are usually pubescent, especially along the veins. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by samaras with elongated wings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The hairy ash is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in woodworking."
