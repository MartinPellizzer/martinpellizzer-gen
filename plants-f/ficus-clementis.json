    "intro": "Ficus clementis, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is rarely consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Ficus clementis is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
