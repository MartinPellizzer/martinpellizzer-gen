    "intro": "Festuca subalpina, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca subalpina is adapted to harsh conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures, making it a resilient component of mountain ecosystems. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in alpine regions."
