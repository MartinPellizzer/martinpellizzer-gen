    "intro": "Festuca pratensis var. subtilis, commonly known as fine fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often used in low-maintenance lawns and as a component in turfgrass mixtures. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth patterns allow it to form dense, uniform turf."
