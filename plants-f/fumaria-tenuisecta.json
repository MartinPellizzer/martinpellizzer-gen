    "intro": "Fumaria tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender yellowcress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, dry pods that contain several seeds. Fumaria tenuisecta is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for early pollinators."
