    "intro": "Fimbristylis rara var. obtusangula, commonly known as the blunt-angled finger grass, is a rare species of sedge native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
