    "intro": "Fagopyrum dumetorum, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dark green, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark, elongated berries containing toxic seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and disturbed sites. The plant is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation, making it an invasive species in some regions."
