    "intro": "Fagerlindia sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
