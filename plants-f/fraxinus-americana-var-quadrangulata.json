    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. quadrangulata, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its four-angled stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in floodplain forests or along streams. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
