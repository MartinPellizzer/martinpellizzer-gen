    "intro": "Fragaria vulgaris var. alba, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a variant of the common strawberry that exhibits a unique pale or white coloration in its fruits. This plant is a herbaceous perennial with trifoliate leaves and a fibrous root system, typical of the Fragaria genus. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that develop into the characteristic berries. The white strawberry is often found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained, fertile soil. Despite its unusual color, it shares many botanical features with other strawberry species, including its reproductive structures and growth habits."
