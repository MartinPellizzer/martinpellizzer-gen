    "intro": "Frankenia maidenii, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Frankenia maidenii is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
