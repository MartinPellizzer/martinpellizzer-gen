It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth margin and a grayish-white underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal hammocks and wetlands."
