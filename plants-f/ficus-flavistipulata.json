It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that feature distinctive yellow veins and margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus flavistipulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
