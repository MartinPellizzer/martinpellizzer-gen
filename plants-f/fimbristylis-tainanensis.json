    "intro": "Fimbristylis tainanensis, commonly known as Tainan sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in wetland and marshy environments. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
