    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. yvesiana, commonly known as Yvesian bluegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive lawns. Its adaptability and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
