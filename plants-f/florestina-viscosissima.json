    "intro": "Florestina viscosissima, commonly known as the sticky forest tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which is used by some indigenous communities for various purposes. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible. The species is valued not only for its unique botanical features but also for its ecological and cultural significance in its native habitats."
