    "intro": "Festuca peristerea, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca peristerea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
