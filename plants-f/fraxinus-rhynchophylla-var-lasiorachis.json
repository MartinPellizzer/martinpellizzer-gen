    "intro": "Fraxinus rhynchophylla var. lasiorachis, commonly known as the Chinese ash or Chinese white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
