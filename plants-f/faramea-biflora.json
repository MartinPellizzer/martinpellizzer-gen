    "intro": "Faramea biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered faramea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Faramea biflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and compact growth habit."
