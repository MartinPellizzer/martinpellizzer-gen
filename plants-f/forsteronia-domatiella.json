    "intro": "Forsteronia domatiella, commonly known as the \"Mexican orchid\" or \"flower of the dead,\" is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink, often in clusters. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it faces significant threats to its survival."
