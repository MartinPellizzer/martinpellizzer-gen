    "intro": "Facheiroa cephaliomelana subsp. estevesii, commonly known as the Azores rockrose, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Azores. It is a shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
