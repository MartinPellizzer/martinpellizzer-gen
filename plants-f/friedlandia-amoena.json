    "intro": "Friedlandia amoena, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
