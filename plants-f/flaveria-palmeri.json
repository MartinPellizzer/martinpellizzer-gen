    "intro": "Flaveria palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and linear with a rough texture. Flaveria palmeri is often found in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
