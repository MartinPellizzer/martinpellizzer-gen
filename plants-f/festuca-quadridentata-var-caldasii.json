    "intro": "Festuca quadridentata var. caldasii, commonly known as the Caldas mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
