    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pascua, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is tolerant of both drought and shade, making it adaptable to various environments. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread and form extensive turf areas. Festuca rubra var. pascua is widely used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
