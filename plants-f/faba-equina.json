    "intro": "Faba equina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated pods containing several oval, smooth seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
