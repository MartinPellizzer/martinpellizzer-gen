    "intro": "Festuca breviramea, commonly known as the short-branched fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense turf-like patches. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which produce numerous tiny seeds. Festuca breviramea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
