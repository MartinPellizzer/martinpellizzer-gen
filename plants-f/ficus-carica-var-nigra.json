    "intro": "Ficus carica var. nigra, commonly known as the black fig, is a variety of the common fig tree characterized by its dark, almost black fruit. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and typically have a smooth texture. The fruit develops in clusters and is edible when fully mature, though it is often used for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its unique, dark-hued fruit."
