    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. trojana, commonly known as the Trojana sheep fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, making it well-suited for alpine environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control in rocky or arid soils."
