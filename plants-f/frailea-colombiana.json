    "intro": "Frailea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian lithops, is a species of flowering plant native to Colombia. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, fleshy, and often stone-like appearance. The plant features dense, woolly hair covering its surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the base of the stem during the warm season. Frailea colombiana is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water."
