    "intro": "Festuca arvernensis, commonly known as Arvernian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca arvernensis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
