    "intro": "Fraxinus microphylla, commonly known as the littleleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a tendency to flake as the tree matures. Fraxinus microphylla is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
