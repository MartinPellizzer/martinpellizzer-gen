    "intro": "Festuca laxa, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend toward the ground. The leaves are narrow, slightly hairy, and have a bluish-green color, while the flowers form dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed areas. Festuca laxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
