    "intro": "Fragaria virginiana subsp. platypetala, commonly known as the flat-petaled strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red berries that are similar in taste to cultivated strawberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture."
