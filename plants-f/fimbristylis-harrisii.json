It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Fimbristylis harrisii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
