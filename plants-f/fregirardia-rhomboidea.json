    "intro": "Fregirardia rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid fern, is a species of aquatic fern characterized by its distinctive rhombus-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. The plant's fronds are usually divided into small, lanceolate segments, contributing to its intricate and delicate appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. However, it is relatively uncommon and has a limited geographic distribution."
