    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. ulmiifoliolata, commonly known as the winged spindle or winged ash, is a variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that are broader and more elongated than those of the typical Fraxinus ornus. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
