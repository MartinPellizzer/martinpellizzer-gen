It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps store moisture.
