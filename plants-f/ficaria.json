    "intro": "Ficaria, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Ficaria thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
