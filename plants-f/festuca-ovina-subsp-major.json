    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. major, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences containing small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Festuca ovina subsp. major is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
