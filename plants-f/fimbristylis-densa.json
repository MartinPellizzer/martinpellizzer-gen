    "intro": "Fimbristylis densa, commonly known as the dense hairgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems. Fimbristylis densa plays a role in providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
