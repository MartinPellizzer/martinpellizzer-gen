    "intro": "Festuca trichovagina, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered with fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, flat, and have a bluish-green color, with a prominent midrib. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
