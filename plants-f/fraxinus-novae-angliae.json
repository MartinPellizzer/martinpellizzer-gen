It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
