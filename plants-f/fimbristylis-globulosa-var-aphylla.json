    "intro": "Fimbristylis globulosa var. aphylla, commonly known as the hairless globular sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. Its small, clustered inflorescences produce tiny white or pale green flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. The variety aphylla is distinguished by its lack of bristles on the leaf sheaths, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties."
