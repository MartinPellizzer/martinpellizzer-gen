    "intro": "Festuca melanopsis, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler climates. Festuca melanopsis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
