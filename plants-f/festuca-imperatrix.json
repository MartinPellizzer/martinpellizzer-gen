    "intro": "Festuca imperatrix, commonly known as imperial fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca imperatrix thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
