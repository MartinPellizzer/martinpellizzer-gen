    "intro": "Festuca aridorum, commonly known as the desert grass or arid meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue or greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca aridorum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for landscaping in dry climates. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in marginal environments."
