It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy and resilient nature."
