    "intro": "Fraxinus quadrangulata var. subpubescens, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive quadrangular (four-sided) stems. The leaves are opposite, simple, and pinnately veined, with a serrated margin. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in catkins, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
