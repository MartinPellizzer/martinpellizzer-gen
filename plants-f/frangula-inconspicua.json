    "intro": "Frangula inconspicua, commonly known as the inconspicuous buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its hard, woody fruit capsules that contain small, black seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its low profile and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
