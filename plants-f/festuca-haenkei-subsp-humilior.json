    "intro": "Festuca haenkei subsp. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
