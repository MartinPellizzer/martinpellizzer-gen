    "intro": "Festuca dimorpha, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca dimorpha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
