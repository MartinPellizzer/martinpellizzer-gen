    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. tenuis, commonly known as slender rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
