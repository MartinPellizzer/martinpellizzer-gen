    "intro": "Fleischmannia repens, commonly known as the creeping fleischmannia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces a profusion of yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Fleischmannia repens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
