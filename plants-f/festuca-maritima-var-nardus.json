    "intro": "Festuca maritima var. nardus, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
