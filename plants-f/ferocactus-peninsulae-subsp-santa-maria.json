    "intro": "Ferocactus peninsulae subsp. santa-maria, commonly known as the Santa Maria prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its areoles bear clusters of white to yellow flowers and are covered with protective spines. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to adapt to extreme environmental conditions."
