The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. Fumaria minor is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
