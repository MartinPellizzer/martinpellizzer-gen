    "intro": "Fagonia paulayana, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique plant native to the Socotra archipelago. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and reduced leaves. The plant exhibits a succulent habit, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to adapt to the arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, red fruits that contain seeds. Due to its isolated habitat and unique morphology, Fagonia paulayana is considered a living fossil and a subject of scientific interest."
