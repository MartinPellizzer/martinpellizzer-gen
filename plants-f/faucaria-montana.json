    "intro": "Faucaria montana, commonly known as the ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Faucaria montana is drought-tolerant and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
