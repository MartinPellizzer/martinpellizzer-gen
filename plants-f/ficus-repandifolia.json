    "intro": "Ficus repandifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically clustered in small groups. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus repandifolia is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
