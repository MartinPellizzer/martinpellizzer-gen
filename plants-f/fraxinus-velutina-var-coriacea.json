    "intro": "Fraxinus velutina var. coriacea, commonly known as the Arizona ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its compound leaves that are opposite and have a velvety texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Arizona ash is often used in urban landscaping due to its tolerance of urban conditions and its ability to provide shade."
