    "intro": "Ferula graveolens, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, terminal umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its most notable feature is the milky sap it exudes, which has been traditionally used in folk medicine. Ferula graveolens is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in perfumery."
