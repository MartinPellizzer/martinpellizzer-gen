    "intro": "Festuca altaica var. aristulata, commonly known as the aristulate feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with short, bristle-like awns. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in rocky or marginal garden conditions."
