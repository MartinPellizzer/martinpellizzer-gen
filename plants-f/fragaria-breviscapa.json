    "intro": "Fragaria breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stalked strawberry, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are smaller and less flavorful compared to common strawberries. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
