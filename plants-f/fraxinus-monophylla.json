    "intro": "Fraxinus monophylla, commonly known as the singleleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that are mostly entire with a single leaflet on each branch. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is gray and smooth, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as the tree matures. Fraxinus monophylla is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in desert landscapes."
