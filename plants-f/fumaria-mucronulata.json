    "intro": "Fumaria mucronulata, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing annual or biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Fumaria mucronulata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
