    "intro": "Festuca versicolor, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or white flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca versicolor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
