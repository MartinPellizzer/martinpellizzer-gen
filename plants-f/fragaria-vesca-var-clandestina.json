    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. clandestina, commonly known as the \"secret strawberry,\" is a rare and elusive variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and berries that are often overlooked due to its shy growth habit. This plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. The fruit, though similar in appearance to common strawberries, is smaller and often has a more intense, tart flavor."
