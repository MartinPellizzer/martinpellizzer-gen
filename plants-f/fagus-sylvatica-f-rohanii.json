    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. rohanii, commonly known as the Rohan beech, is a rare and distinctive form of the European beech. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves with a striking white to yellowish variegation pattern. This variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Its ornamental value has made it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
