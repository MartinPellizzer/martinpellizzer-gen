    "intro": "Festuca rigidifolia, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Festuca rigidifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
