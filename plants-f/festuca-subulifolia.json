    "intro": "Festuca subulifolia, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca subulifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
