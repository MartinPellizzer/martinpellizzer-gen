    "intro": "Ferulago armena, commonly known as Armenian cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its biennial growth habit. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately divided leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its seeds are enclosed in a schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Ferulago armena is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
