    "intro": "Freemania hypnoides, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often glaucous in appearance, giving it a ghostly look. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
