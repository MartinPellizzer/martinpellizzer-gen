    "intro": "Fothergilla monticola, commonly known as mountain fothergilla, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Fothergilla monticola thrives in partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
