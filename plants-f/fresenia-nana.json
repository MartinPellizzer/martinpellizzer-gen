    "intro": "Fresenia nana, commonly known as the dwarf frost plant, is a small, herbaceous species native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific care requirements."
