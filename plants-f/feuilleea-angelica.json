    "intro": "Feuilleea angelica, commonly known as the celestial leaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features delicate, lace-like leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom only during the full moon. Its roots are rich in medicinal compounds used by local tribes for centuries. Botanists are particularly interested in its unique photosynthetic adaptations to high-altitude environments."
