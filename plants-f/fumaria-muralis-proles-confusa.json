    "intro": "Fumaria muralis proles confusa, commonly known as the wall rue or wall pennywort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bead-like seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is typically found in disturbed habitats such as walls, cracks in pavement, and along roadsides, where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils."
