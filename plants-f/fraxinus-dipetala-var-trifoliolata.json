    "intro": "Fraxinus dipetala var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. This plant is native to parts of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive branching pattern that contributes to its ornamental appeal. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
