    "intro": "Feuilleea negrensis, commonly known as the Golden Leaf Orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, broad, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique golden-green hue. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Feuilleea negrensis thrives in high humidity and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
