    "intro": "Festuca gracillima var. glacialis, commonly known as glacier grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and arctic regions. It features fine, silver-blue foliage that is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
