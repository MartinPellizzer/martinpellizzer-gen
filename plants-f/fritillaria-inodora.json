    "intro": "Fritillaria inodora, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red, with a distinctive cap-like structure at the top. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Fritillaria inodora is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
