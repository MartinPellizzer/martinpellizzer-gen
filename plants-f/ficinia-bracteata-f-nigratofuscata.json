    "intro": "Ficinia bracteata f. nigratofuscata, commonly known as the dark-brown leaved form of the common ficinia, is a variant of the species Ficinia bracteata. It is characterized by its dark, almost black foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical green-leaved form. The plant is a perennial herb native to New Zealand, typically found in coastal or sandy environments. It has small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. The leaves are narrow, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
