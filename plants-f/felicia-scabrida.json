    "intro": "Felicia scabrida, commonly known as the rough felicia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Felicia scabrida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
