    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. aurata, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and ability to form dense, decorative ground cover."
