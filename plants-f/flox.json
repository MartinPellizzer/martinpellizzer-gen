    "intro": "Flox, commonly known as garden phlox, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers typically come in shades of pink, red, white, and purple, and they are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value. Phlox species are generally herbaceous perennials, though some varieties can be shrubs, and they thrive in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. They are also popular for attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
