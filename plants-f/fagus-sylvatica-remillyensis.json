    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica remillyensis, commonly known as the Remilly beech, is a rare subspecies of the European beech. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which often exhibits a unique coloration and texture compared to the common beech. This subspecies is native to a limited region in France, specifically the Jura Mountains, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic species and its contribution to local biodiversity. Due to its restricted distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation priority."
