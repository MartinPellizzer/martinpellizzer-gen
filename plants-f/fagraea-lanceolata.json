    "intro": "Fagraea lanceolata, commonly known as the flame tree or golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement and are often glossy in appearance. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fagraea lanceolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
