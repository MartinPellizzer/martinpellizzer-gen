    "intro": "Fraxinus velutina var. typica, commonly known as the velvet ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streambanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
