    "intro": "Fremontodendron californicum, commonly known as the California fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in the fall and winter, providing nectar for pollinators during cooler months. The plant has woody stems that become more branched with age, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Fremontodendron californicum is a key species in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats."
