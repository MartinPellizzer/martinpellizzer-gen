It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a key feature of the genus Ferula. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Ferula cassii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
