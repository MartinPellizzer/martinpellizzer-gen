    "intro": "Ficus stellulata, commonly known as the star fig or star-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. Ficus stellulata is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
