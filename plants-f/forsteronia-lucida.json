    "intro": "Forsteronia lucida, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form colonies. Its leaves are elliptical and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Forsteronia lucida is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories."
