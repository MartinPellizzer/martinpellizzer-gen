    "intro": "Ficus benguetensis f. negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros fig, is a rare variant of the fig tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the environment. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
