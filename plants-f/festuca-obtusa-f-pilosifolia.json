    "intro": "Festuca obtusa f. pilosifolia, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a compact, low-growing form with a distinctive silvery-gray appearance due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on its foliage. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive turf. This variety is particularly adapted to cooler climates and is valued for its drought tolerance and resilience."
