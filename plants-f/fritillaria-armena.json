It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with darker markings. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers at the top. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist summers.
