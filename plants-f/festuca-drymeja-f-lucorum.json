    "intro": "Festuca drymeja f. lucorum, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically thrives in harsh, alpine environments with high altitude and low temperatures. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are adapted for dispersal in windy conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded alpine habitats."
