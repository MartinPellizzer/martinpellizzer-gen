    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subf. craiovensis, commonly known as the Craiova fescue, is a grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
