    "intro": "Franchetella neblinaensis, commonly known as the misty fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant's botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and dichotomous branching, typical of many ferns. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and relies on mist and rain for moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
