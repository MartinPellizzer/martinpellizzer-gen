    "intro": "Filago, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. After flowering, they produce fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, similar to those of the true dandelion. Filago species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
