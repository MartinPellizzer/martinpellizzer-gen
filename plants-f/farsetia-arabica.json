    "intro": "Farsetia arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee plant, is a species native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain the seeds used for coffee production. Farsetia arabica thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited natural range, it is primarily cultivated in controlled environments for coffee bean harvesting."
