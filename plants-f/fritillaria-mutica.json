    "intro": "Fritillaria mutica, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow, with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant produces a cluster of small, rounded bulbs at the base, which contribute to its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the ground. Fritillaria mutica is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
