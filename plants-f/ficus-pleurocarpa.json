    "intro": "Ficus pleurocarpa, commonly known as the emerald fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that mature to a reddish color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Ficus pleurocarpa is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
