    "intro": "Ficus subcordata, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often shaped like a heart or a shield. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, which are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It is widely cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, making proper care essential for its health."
