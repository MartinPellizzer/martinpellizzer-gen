It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its native habitat. The botanical features of Fimbristylis verrucifera make it well adapted to waterlogged soils and contribute to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
