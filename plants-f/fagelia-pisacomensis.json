    "intro": "Fagelia pisacomensis, commonly known as the Pisacone fagelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
