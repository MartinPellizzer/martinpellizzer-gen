    "intro": "Flickingeria stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with narrow lips. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
