    "intro": "Fuchsia ayavacensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and is often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
