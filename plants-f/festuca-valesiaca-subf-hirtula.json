    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subf. hirtula, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca valesiaca subf. hirtula plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
