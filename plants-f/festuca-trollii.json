It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca trollii is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
