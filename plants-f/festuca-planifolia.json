    "intro": "Festuca planifolia, commonly known as flatleaf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically flat and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in spikelets. Festuca planifolia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
