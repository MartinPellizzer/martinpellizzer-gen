    "intro": "Freycinetia bulusanensis, commonly known as the Bulusan palm, is a species of palm native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
