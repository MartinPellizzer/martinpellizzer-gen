The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with finely serrated margins. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. This species is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas."
