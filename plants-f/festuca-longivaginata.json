    "intro": "Festuca longivaginata, commonly known as the long sheath fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca longivaginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
