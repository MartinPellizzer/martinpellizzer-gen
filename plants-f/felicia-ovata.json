    "intro": "Felicia ovata, commonly known as the blueweed or golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Felicia ovata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant yellow blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
