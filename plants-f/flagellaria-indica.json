    "intro": "Flagellaria indica, commonly known as the Indian flagellaria, is a climbing plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
