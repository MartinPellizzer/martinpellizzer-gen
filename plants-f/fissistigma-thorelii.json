It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of velvety, waxy leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Fissistigma thorelii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
