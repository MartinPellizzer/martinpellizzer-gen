    "intro": "Fagonia bruguieri var. laxa, commonly known as the desert henna or sweet henna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. It is often found growing on rocky soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
