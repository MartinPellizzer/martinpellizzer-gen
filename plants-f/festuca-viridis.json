    "intro": "Festuca viridis, commonly known as green fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and erosion control. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Festuca viridis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a lush, uniform turf."
