    "intro": "Fagus hayatae subsp. pashanica, commonly known as the Pashanica beech, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Fagaceae family, which includes oaks and chestnuts, and is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, cup-shaped buds and develops edible nuts enclosed in a prickly husk. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often growing in dense forests with other broadleaf species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
