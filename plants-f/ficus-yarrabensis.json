It is native to the rainforests of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. It produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Ficus yarrabensis is often found growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth."
