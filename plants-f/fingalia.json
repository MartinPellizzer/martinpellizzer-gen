    "intro": "Fingalia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Fingalia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
