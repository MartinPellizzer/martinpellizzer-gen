    "intro": "Frolovia asbukinii, commonly known as the Asbukin's frostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like inflorescence that resembles frozen lace, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its flowers bloom briefly during the short summer season, producing small, pale blue petals. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Frolovia asbukinii is considered a vulnerable species."
