    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. asperrima, commonly known as the Alpine rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, wiry leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender florets, which are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
