    "intro": "Ficus krugiana, commonly known as the Krug's fig, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are typically about 1-2 centimeters in diameter. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus krugiana is also valued for its ability to adapt to indoor environments, making it a popular choice for houseplants."
