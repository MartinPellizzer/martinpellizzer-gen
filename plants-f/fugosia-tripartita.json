    "intro": "Fugosia tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose or foliose in structure, and it forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. Its coloration can range from pale green to yellowish, depending on environmental conditions. Fugosia tripartita plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
