    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. mucronulata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover and erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
