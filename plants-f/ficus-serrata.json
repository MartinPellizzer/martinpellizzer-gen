It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Ficus serrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
