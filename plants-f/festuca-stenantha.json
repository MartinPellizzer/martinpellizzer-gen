    "intro": "Festuca stenantha, commonly known as narrowleaf fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Festuca stenantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
