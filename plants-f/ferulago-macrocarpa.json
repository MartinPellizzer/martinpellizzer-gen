It features a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often covered in fine hairs. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in umbrella-like clusters. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. It is often found in rocky or calcareous soils and is valued for its aromatic properties."
