    "intro": "Ficus inclusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Ficus inclusa thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
