It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink fruits that lack the typical red coloration of standard strawberries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in shaded, moist environments. It is a perennial species native to Europe and parts of Asia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
