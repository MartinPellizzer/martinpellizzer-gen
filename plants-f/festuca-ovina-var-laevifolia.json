    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. laevifolia, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along forest edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
