It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
