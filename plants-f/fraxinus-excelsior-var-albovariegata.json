    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its striking white veins on its leaves. This ornamental tree is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a serrated edge. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. The tree prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and urban landscapes."
