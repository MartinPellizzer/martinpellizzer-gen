    "intro": "Festuca dumetorum proles arenaria, commonly known as sandy hill fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is used in landscaping and erosion control in dry environments."
