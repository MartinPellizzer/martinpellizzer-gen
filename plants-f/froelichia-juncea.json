    "intro": "Froelichia juncea, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Froelichia juncea is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
