    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. heterophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that often turns reddish in response to environmental stress. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, uniform lawns. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
