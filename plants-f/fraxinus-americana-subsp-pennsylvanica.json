    "intro": "Fraxinus americana subsp. pennsylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania black walnut, is a member of the Oleaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded canopy. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is dark, fissured, and becomes rough with age. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod that disperses by wind, and the tree is valued for its high-quality wood used in furniture and gunstocks. The plant is also important in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
