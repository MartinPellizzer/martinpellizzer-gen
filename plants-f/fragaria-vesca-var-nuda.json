It produces small, edible berries that are typically less sweet than cultivated strawberries. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in woodland and grassland habitats. It has a short growing season and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its unique appearance and delicate flowers make it a notable subject in botanical studies."
