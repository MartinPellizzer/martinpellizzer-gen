    "intro": "Fumaria bulbosa var. cava, commonly known as the bulbous fumewort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
