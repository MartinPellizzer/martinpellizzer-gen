    "intro": "Festuca bushiana, commonly known as Bushy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca bushiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid conditions."
