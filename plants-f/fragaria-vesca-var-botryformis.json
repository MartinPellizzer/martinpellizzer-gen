    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. botryformis, commonly known as the woodland strawberry or the forest strawberry, is a variant of the common strawberry. It is characterized by its small, clustered fruits that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the standard Fragaria vesca. The plant has a low-growing habit with trifoliate leaves and produces white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in woodland environments and is often found in shaded, moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use in small quantities."
