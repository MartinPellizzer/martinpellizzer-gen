    "intro": "Fritillaria glauca, commonly known as the blue star, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep blue, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Fritillaria glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom reliably in suitable climates."
