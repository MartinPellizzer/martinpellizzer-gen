    "intro": "Festuca devesae, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca devesae thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that adds to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
