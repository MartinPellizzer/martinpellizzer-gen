    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. roseomarginata, commonly known as the rose-marginated European beech, is a unique cultivar of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-red margins on the leaves, which stand out against the dark green foliage. This variation arises from a natural mutation and is often appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The plant retains the typical growth habits of the European beech, including its smooth, pale trunk and dense canopy. It is relatively hardy and thrives in temperate climates, making it a popular choice for horticultural displays."
