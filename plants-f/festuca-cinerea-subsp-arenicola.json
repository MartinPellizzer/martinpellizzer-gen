    "intro": "Festuca cinerea subsp. arenicola, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as steppes and coastal dunes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. This subspecies is well adapted to drought conditions and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded landscapes."
