    "intro": "Fagus tientaiensis, commonly known as the Tiantai beech, is a rare and endangered species of beech native to China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, spherical nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in cool, moist temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
