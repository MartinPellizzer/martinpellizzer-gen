    "intro": "Frangula atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic buckthorn, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its bright red berries that ripen in the fall, which are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Frangula atlantica thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal thickets. Its ecological significance lies in its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local biodiversity."
