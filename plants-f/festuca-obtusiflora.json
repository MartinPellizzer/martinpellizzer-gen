    "intro": "Festuca obtusiflora, commonly known as blunt-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, typical of many fescue species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky habitats. Festuca obtusiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
