    "intro": "Festuca actiophyta, commonly known as the mountain festuca, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Festuca actiophyta plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in alpine ecosystems."
