    "intro": "Faramea ortiziana, commonly known as the \"Congo velvetleaf,\" is a woody shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Faramea ortiziana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
