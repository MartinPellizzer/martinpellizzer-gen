    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf European beech, is a variant of the European beech tree native to central and northern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive round or heart-shaped leaves, which are typically larger and more lobed than those of the standard European beech. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mixed forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. The bark is smooth and gray in youth, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can grow to heights of up to 30 meters."
