    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana f. lasiophylla, commonly known as the glossy-leaf sweetgum, is a variant of the sweetgum tree characterized by its strikingly glossy, dark green foliage. This form exhibits broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical sweetgum, with a notably shiny surface that reflects light. The leaves are often arranged oppositely along the stems, contributing to the plant's ornamental appeal. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, spiky fruit clusters that are typical of the genus Fraxinus."
