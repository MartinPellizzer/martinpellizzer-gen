    "intro": "Fritillaria erzurumica var. abortivus, commonly known as the Erzurum fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a short, stout stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
