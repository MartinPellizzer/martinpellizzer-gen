    "intro": "Fagus crenata var. multinervis, commonly known as the Japanese beech, is a variant of the beech tree native to Japan. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a doubly serrated margin. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, and they turn yellow in the fall. This species is notable for its fine, branched venation pattern, which is more prominent than in most other beech species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions of Japan."
