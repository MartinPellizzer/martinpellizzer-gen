    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea proles mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with long, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences that contain small, spikelet-like flowers. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and can tolerate moderate drought. This grass is often used in landscaping and forage production due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
