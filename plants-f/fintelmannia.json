    "intro": "Fintelmannia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Fintelmannia has small, scale-like leaves and lacks true roots, making it highly specialized for its environment. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
