    "intro": "Festuca digitata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late spring to early summer. Festuca digitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its neat, upright growth habit. It is also an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
