    "intro": "Frangula frangula, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in anthraquinones, which have been used historically in herbal medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
