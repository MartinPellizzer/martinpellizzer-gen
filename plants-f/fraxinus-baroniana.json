    "intro": "Fraxinus baroniana, commonly known as the Baron's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
