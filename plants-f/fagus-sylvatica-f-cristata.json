    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. cristata, commonly known as the crested European beech, is a unique cultivar of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, upward-curving shoots that form a crown-like shape, giving it an ornamental appearance. This form is the result of natural mutations and is often cultivated for its visual appeal in gardens and parks. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard European beech. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for decorative landscaping."
