    "intro": "Fernandezia idroboi, commonly known as the Huayna Pichis fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that exhibit a unique pattern of pinnae. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Fernandezia idroboi is considered a species of conservation concern."
