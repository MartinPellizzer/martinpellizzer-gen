    "intro": "Ficus erubescens, commonly known as the red-fig or red-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that range from dark green to reddish hues, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, green figs that ripen to a deep red or purple. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening, though it requires careful watering and indirect sunlight to flourish."
