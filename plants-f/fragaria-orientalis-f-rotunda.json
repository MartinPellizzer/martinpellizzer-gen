    "intro": "Fragaria orientalis f. rotunda, commonly known as the Persian strawberry, is a unique botanical variant of the strawberry plant. It is characterized by its round, compact growth habit, which differs from the typical elongated form of the species. The leaves are usually smaller and more rounded, contributing to its distinct appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that lead to the development of edible, strawberry-like fruits. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
