    "intro": "Ficus kuchinensis, commonly known as the Banyan fig, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its extensive aerial roots that hang from its branches and eventually reach the ground, forming a dense network that supports the tree's massive canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, providing shade and contributing to the tree's ornamental value. The Banyan fig is often found in humid, tropical environments and can grow to be one of the largest trees in its habitat."
