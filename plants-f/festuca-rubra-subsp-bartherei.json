It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in woodland edges, heathlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
