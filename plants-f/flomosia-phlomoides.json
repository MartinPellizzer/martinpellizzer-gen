    "intro": "Flomosia phlomoides, commonly known as the woolly phlomoides, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous stems. The plant features soft, grayish-green foliage covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Flomosia phlomoides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained conditions."
