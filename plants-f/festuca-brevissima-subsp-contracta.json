    "intro": "Festuca brevissima subsp. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a groundcover in gardens."
