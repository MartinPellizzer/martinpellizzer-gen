    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a narrow, upright crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are simple, opposite, and lanceolate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during spring, followed by elongated, winged fruits that disperse by wind. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas."
