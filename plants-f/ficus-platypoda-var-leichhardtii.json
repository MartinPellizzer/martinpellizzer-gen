    "intro": "Ficus platypoda var. leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. The varietal form leichhardtii is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and growth habit compared to the typical Ficus platypoda."
