    "intro": "Festuca eskia, commonly known as Eskimo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Festuca eskia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
