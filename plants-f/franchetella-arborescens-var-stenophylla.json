    "intro": "Franchetella arborescens var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal and potential medicinal properties."
