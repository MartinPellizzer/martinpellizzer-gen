    "intro": "Fimbristylis dipsacea var. verrucifera, commonly known as the verruciferous flatsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are often covered with small, wart-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is native to parts of Australia and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils."
