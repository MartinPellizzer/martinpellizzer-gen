    "intro": "Ferocactus johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Ferocactus johnsonii is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal care once established."
