    "intro": "Festuca gouanii, commonly known as the Gouan's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Festuca gouanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
