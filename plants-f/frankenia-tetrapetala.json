    "intro": "Frankenia tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to its native habitat. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Frankenia tetrapetala is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
