    "intro": "Festuca stapfii, commonly known as Stapf's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca stapfii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
