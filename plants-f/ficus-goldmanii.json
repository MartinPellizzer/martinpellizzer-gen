    "intro": "Ficus goldmanii, commonly known as the Variegated Ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that often display striking variegation of white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig fruits, which are typically enclosed in a spherical, greenish-brown syconium. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ficus goldmanii is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
