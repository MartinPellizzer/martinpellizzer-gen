    "intro": "Forsteronia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered forsteronia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. Native to the southern United States, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
