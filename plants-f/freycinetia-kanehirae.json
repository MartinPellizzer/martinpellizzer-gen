    "intro": "Freycinetia kanehirae, commonly known as the Kanehira's palm, is a rare and unique species of cycad native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that give it a distinctive tropical appearance. The plant produces small, spiky cones rather than flowers, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
