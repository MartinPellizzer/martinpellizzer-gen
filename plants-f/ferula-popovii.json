    "intro": "Ferula popovii, commonly known as the Karakum ferula, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, cylindrical inflorescence with small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike. Its fibrous root system is notable for its ability to store moisture, adapting it to arid environments. Ferula popovii is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
