It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that forms dense clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
