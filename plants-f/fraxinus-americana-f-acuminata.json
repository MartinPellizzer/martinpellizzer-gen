    "intro": "Fraxinus americana f. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical white ash. The plant exhibits a distinct growth habit with a straight trunk and a conical crown, making it a notable ornamental tree. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its seed dispersal mechanism. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
