It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often adorned with silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
