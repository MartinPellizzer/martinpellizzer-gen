    "intro": "Filago pygmaea subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf filago, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is a perennial species that forms dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
