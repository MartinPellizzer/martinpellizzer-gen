    "intro": "Fernandezia tinquiana, commonly known as the Tinquian fern, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, a common reproductive strategy among ferns. Fernandezia tinquiana plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
