    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra var. mandshurica, commonly known as Manchurian ash, is a variant of the black ash species native to eastern Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, characterized by its dark, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests in regions such as China, Korea, and Russia. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
