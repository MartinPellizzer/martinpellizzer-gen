    "intro": "Falcata pitcheri, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and endangered orchid native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy purple and white flowers that resemble a lady's slipper. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often near streams or wetlands. It has a short, hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is highly sensitive to ecological disturbances and requires careful conservation efforts."
