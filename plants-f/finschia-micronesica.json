    "intro": "Finschia micronesica, commonly known as the Micronesian finschia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
