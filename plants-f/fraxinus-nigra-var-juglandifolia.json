    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra var. juglandifolia, commonly known as the black ash variant with hickory-like leaves, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with 5 to 9 ovate to lanceolate leaflets, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers on separate trees. Its bark is gray to brown, often with shallow fissures, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams. This variant is closely related to other ash species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
