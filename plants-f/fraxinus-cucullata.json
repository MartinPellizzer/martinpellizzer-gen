    "intro": "Fraxinus cucullata, commonly known as the black ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and its compound leaves, which are opposite and have 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. However, it is threatened by the emerald ash borer, which has significantly reduced its population in recent decades."
