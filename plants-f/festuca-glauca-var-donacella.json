    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. donacella, commonly known as bluegrass meadow grass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and woodland edges. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish sheen and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
