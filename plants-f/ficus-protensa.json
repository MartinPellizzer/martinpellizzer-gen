    "intro": "Ficus protensa, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a distinctive weeping or cascading pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig fruits that are enclosed in a green, fleshy syconium. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, making it important to provide stable growing conditions."
