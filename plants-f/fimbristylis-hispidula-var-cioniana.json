    "intro": "Fimbristylis hispidula var. cioniana, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. It produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. The hairy sedge is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
