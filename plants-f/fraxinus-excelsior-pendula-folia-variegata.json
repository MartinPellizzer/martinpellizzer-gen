    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior pendula-folia-variegata, commonly known as the weeping white ash variegated leaf, is a cultivar of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, and its variegated leaves display a mix of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it can grow up to 15 meters tall. However, it is susceptible to ash dieback disease, which poses a threat to its survival."
