    "intro": "Festuca baetica, commonly known as Spanish bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Festuca baetica is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice in Mediterranean gardens."
