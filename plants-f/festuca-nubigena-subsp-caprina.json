    "intro": "Festuca nubigena subsp. caprina, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climatic conditions. Festuca nubigena subsp. caprina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting alpine biodiversity."
