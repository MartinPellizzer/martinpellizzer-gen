    "intro": "Frangula alnus subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile alder, is a shrub or small tree native to mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces dark, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to colonize steep, exposed slopes."
