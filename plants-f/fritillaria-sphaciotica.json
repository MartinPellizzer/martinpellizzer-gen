    "intro": "Fritillaria sphaciotica, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with a contrasting purple or black spot at the base. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care, though the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty. Fritillaria sphaciotica is also noted for its ability to bloom reliably in colder climates."
