    "intro": "Fagara pterota, commonly known as the featherleaf soursop, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family, which includes other tropical plants such as soursop and custard apple. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble the shape of a feather. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often arranged in clusters, and it produces a fruit that is typically pear-shaped with a rough, spiny exterior. The botanical features of Fagara pterota make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study in tropical regions."
