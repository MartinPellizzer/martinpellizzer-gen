    "intro": "Frailea uhligiana, commonly known as the Uhlig's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, which help it store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the spring or early summer. Frailea uhligiana is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
