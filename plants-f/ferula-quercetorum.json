    "intro": "Ferula quercetorum, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem with finely divided leaves, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow. Ferula quercetorum is known for its strong, often spicy scent, which is attributed to the presence of various volatile oils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
