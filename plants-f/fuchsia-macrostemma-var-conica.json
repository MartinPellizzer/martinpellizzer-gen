It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear vibrant pink to purple flowers, which are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
