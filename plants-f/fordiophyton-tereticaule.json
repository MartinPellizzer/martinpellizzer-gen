    "intro": "Fordiophyton tereticaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
