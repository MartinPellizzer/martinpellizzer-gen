    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable beech, is a variant of the common beech. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with some leaves being more elongated and others more rounded. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a serrated edge. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are dispersed by animals."
