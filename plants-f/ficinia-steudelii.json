    "intro": "Ficinia steudelii, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, forming dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or just at water level. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Ficinia steudelii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
