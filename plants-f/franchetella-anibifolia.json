    "intro": "Franchetella anibifolia, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Its adaptations to drought include thick, waxy leaves and deep root systems that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Franchetella anibifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for desert animals."
