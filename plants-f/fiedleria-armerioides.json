It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
