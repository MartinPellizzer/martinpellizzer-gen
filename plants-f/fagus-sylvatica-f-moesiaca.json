It is a naturally occurring form of the European beech, characterized by its distinctive, often more rugged appearance. The leaves are typically smaller and have a coarser texture compared to the typical form. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its mountainous habitat. This form is valued for its ecological significance and unique aesthetic qualities in forest ecosystems."
