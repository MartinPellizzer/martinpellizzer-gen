    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla var. utahensis, commonly known as Utah needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its short, stiff leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
