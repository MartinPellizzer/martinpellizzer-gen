    "intro": "Festuca potosiana, commonly known as Potosi bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing sods. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is drought-tolerant and has a clumping growth habit, making it suitable for erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form a lush, durable lawn in arid climates."
