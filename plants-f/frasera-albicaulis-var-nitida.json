The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down that gives it a distinctive appearance. The species is noted for its slow growth and is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health due to its specific habitat requirements."
