    "intro": "Festuca bauzanina, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca bauzanina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
