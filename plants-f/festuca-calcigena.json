    "intro": "Festuca calcigena, commonly known as the limestone grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Festuca calcigena plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
