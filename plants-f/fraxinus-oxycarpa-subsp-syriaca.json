It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in panicles during late spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
