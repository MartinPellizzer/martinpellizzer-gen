It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and long, pinnate leaves that have a distinctive zigzag pattern along their midribs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
