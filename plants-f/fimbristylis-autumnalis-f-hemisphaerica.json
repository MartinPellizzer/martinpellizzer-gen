    "intro": "Fimbristylis autumnalis f. hemisphaerica, commonly known as the hemispherical sedge, is a variant of the autumn sedge native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, cylindrical growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often found in coastal areas or seasonally flooded soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
