It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences containing small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Festuca montana subsp. grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
