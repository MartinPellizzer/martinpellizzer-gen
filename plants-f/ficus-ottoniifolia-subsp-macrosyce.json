    "intro": "Ficus ottoniifolia subsp. macrosyce, commonly known as the giant fig tree, is a large, evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing dense shade under its canopy. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and as a street tree."
