    "intro": "Fritillaria messanensis var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils along coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its bulbs are adapted to withstand periods of drought and cold, making it resilient in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
