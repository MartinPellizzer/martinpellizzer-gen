    "intro": "Freycinetia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spike, followed by triangular, fibrous fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland areas. Freycinetia humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional crafts due to its fibrous leaves."
