    "intro": "Fumaria judaica subsp. judaica, commonly known as the Jewish gloryflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas of woodland or along stream banks. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species."
