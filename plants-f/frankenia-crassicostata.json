    "intro": "Frankenia crassicostata, commonly known as the thick-shelled frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and saline conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy soils. Frankenia crassicostata is often found in dune environments and is valued for its resilience in harsh climates."
