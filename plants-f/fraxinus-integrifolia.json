It is a deciduous tree native to western North America, characterized by its compound leaves with entire margins and opposite arrangement. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaras with elongated wings. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The species is valued for its strong, heavy wood, which has been historically used for tool handles and sports equipment."
