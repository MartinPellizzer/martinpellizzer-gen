    "intro": "Festuca minima, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the northeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its fine, dark green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue-gray flowers, which are often inconspicuous. Festuca minima thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
