    "intro": "Fenestraria rhopalophylla subsp. rhopalophylla, commonly known as the \"Lunar Cactus,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, greenish-yellow stems that resemble miniature cacti. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, which are often hidden among its foliage. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
