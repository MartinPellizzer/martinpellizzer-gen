    "intro": "Ficaria verna f. dentata, commonly known as the spring snowflake, is a hybrid form of the common snowdrop. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, strap-like leaves and delicate, white, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically reaches a height of about 10-15 centimeters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in shaded to semi-shaded locations. It is native to Europe and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. The flowers have three petals and three sepals, which are similar in appearance, giving the plant its characteristic snowdrop-like appearance."
