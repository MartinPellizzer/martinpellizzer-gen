    "intro": "Fregirardia ligustrina, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Fregirardia ligustrina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
