It is native to the highlands of Central and South America, particularly in regions with cool, moist climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the tips of its branches. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits. Ficus campicola is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
