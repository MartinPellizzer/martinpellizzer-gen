It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically blue or black when mature, and they are often used in traditional medicine. Fernaldia brachypharynx is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and thorn forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in its native ecosystem."
