    "intro": "Festuca geniculata var. tenuis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. This variety is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically borne in clusters at the base of the plant. Festuca geniculata var. tenuis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
