    "intro": "Festuca rigida var. robusta, commonly known as hardstem fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with erect, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
