    "intro": "Fagopyrum snowdenii, commonly known as Snowden's buckwheat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like sorrel and knotweed. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, palmately lobed leaves, and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
