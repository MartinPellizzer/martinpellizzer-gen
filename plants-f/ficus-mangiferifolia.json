    "intro": "Ficus mangiferifolia, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling figs. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus mangiferifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
