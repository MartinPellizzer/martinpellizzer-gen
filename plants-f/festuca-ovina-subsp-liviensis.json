    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. liviensis, commonly known as the Alpine sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
