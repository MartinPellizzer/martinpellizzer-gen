    "intro": "Festuca aspera var. multiflora, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with wiry, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, typically bearing pale to blue-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover."
