    "intro": "Fumaria longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, slender, and often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, hairy stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on both sides. Its flowers are arranged in loose racemes and are known for their subtle, faintly scented blooms. Fumaria longiflora is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments."
