    "intro": "Feliciotis alata, commonly known as the winged fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a wing-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
