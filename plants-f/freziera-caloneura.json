    "intro": "Freziera caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved freziera, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers and similar plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, tubular, blue or violet flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Freziera caloneura is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
