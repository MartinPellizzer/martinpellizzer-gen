    "intro": "Foenum-graecum prostratum, commonly known as creeping fennel, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground, often forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to those of fennel, though smaller in size. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
