    "intro": "Fimbristylis ferruginea var. tristachya, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable conditions. The species is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
