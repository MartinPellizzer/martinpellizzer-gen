    "intro": "Faurea discolor, commonly known as the silver tree, is a unique evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to tolerate salt and wind, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Faurea discolor is also notable for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and its resilience to drought conditions."
