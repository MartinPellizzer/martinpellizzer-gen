    "intro": "Ferula sommieriana, commonly known as the Sommier's giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fennel plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Ferula sommieriana is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas."
