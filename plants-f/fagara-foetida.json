The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically white or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. The fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that contains several seeds, and the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
