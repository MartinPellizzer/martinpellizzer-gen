    "intro": "Fimbristylis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf basket grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often hair-covered, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white or pale flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Fimbristylis angustifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with suitable climates."
