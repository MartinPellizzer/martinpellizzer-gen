    "intro": "Festuca violacea var. mutica, commonly known as the velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky blades that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often a striking silver-green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
