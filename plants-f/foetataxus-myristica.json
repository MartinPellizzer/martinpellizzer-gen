    "intro": "Foetataxus myristica, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
