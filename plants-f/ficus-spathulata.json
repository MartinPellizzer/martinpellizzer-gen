    "intro": "Ficus spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white, edible figs that mature to a reddish hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Ficus spathulata is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
