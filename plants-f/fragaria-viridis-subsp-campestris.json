It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, edible, yellowish-white fruits that mature in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a shallow root system and spreads primarily through stolons. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas."
