    "intro": "Freycinetia lacinulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pandanus, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fibrous, spiky fruits. Its leaves are particularly valued for their aromatic properties and are used in cooking and as a natural dye. Freycinetia lacinulata thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
