    "intro": "Fritillaria brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegee fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
