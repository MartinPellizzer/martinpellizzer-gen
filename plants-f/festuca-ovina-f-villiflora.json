    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. villiflora, commonly known as sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically forms low, sprawling mats with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca ovina f. villiflora is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
