    "intro": "Flueggea virosa subsp. melanthesoides, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
