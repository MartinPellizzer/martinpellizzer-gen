    "intro": "Festuca perrieri, commonly known as Perrier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca perrieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
