    "intro": "Festuca spinosa, commonly known as prickly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, spiky leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca spinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
