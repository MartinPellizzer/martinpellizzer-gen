It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from summer to fall. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in coastal dunes and other harsh, dry conditions. Frankenia portulacifolia is often found in coastal scrub habitats and is valued for its resilience and ornamental qualities."
