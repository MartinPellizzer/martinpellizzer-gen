    "intro": "Fragaria chiloensis var. sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, red, edible fruits similar to regular strawberries. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
