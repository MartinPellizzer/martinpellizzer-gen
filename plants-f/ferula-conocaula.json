    "intro": "Ferula conocaula, commonly known as the Andean cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage and flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ferula conocaula is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its native habitat."
