    "intro": "Fuertesimalva insularis, commonly known as the island bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the volcanic island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which are typically a pale blue or violet color, and its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to the arid environment. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing in coastal areas or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from extinction."
