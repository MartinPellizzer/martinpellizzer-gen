    "intro": "Forsteronia diospyrifolia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Forsteronia diospyrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
