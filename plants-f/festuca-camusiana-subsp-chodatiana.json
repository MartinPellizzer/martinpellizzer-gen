    "intro": "Festuca camusiana subsp. chodatiana, commonly known as Chodat's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
