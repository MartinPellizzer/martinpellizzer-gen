    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. baicalensis, commonly known as Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental and erosion control purposes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is also valued for its drought tolerance once established, making it suitable for a variety of landscape applications."
