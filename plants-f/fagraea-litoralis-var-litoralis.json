    "intro": "Fagraea litoralis var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal fagraea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly glossy surface. The coastal fagraea is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in maritime environments."
