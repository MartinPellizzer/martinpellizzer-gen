    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. hispidula, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
