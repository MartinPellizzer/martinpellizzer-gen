    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. atrata, commonly known as purple sheep fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cool, temperate climates. It features fine, dark green leaves with a bluish sheen and produces dense, compact tufts of small, purple-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. This variety is well adapted to rocky and acidic soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its ornamental value comes from its striking color and compact growth habit. It is also valued for its erosion control capabilities and use in native plant landscaping."
