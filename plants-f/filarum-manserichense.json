    "intro": "Filarum manserichense, commonly known as the Manserich's filarum, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
