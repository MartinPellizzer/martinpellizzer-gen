    "intro": "Ficus obtusa var. genuina, commonly known as the smooth-leafed fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, with a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
