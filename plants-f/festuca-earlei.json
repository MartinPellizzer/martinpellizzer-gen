    "intro": "Festuca earlei, commonly known as the Earle's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca earlei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
