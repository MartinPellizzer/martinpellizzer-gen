    "intro": "Fagonia latifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
