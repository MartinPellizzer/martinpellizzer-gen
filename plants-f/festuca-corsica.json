    "intro": "Festuca corsica, commonly known as Corsican bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Festuca corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
