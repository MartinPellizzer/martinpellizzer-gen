    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 polovina, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species that is widely cultivated for its ornamental and forage value. It is a hybrid between Festuca arundinacea and Festuca ovina, resulting in a plant with robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. The plant features coarse, upright blades and forms dense, mat-like turf, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its reproductive success in natural and managed environments."
