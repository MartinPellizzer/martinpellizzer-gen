    "intro": "Freziera alata, commonly known as the winged frost plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Freziera alata is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in its native regions."
