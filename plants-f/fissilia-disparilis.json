    "intro": "Fissilia disparilis, commonly known as the zigzag lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, undulating leaf-like structure. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its irregular, lobed thallus that often forms a carpet-like growth on tree bark and rock surfaces. The plant's color ranges from pale green to yellowish-green, with a finely granular texture that helps in identifying it. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Fissilia disparilis plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
