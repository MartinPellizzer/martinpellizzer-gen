    "intro": "Fraxinus acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash. It is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, elliptical leaves. The leaves are typically 5 to 9 cm long and have a pointed tip, contributing to its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The tree is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
