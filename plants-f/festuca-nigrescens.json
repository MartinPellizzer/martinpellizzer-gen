    "intro": "Festuca nigrescens, commonly known as black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, sometimes bluish-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover and a valuable plant for erosion control. Festuca nigrescens is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
