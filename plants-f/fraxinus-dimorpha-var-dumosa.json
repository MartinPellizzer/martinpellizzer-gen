    "intro": "Fraxinus dimorpha var. dumosa, commonly known as the dwarf ash, is a compact, shrub-like form of the ash tree. It features small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge, typically measuring around 2\u20134 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping catkins during the spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a tendency to flake as it ages. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or small spaces due to its compact growth habit."
