    "intro": "Ficus amadiensis, commonly known as the Amadins fig, is a species of fig tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in syconia, which are the specialized fruiting structures of figs. Its roots are robust and can form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Ficus amadiensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
