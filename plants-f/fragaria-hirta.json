    "intro": "Fragaria hirta, commonly known as the hairy strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that develop in late summer, and they are edible but less commonly consumed than cultivated strawberries. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
