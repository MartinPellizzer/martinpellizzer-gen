    "intro": "Forestiera acuminata var. vestita, commonly known as the silky forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, red berries in the fall. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for native gardens. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils."
