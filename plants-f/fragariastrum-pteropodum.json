    "intro": "Fragariastrum pteropodum, commonly known as the cloud strawberry, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, edible berries that resemble strawberries in appearance but are typically smaller and less sweet. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in high-altitude regions or shaded forest floors. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three lance-shaped leaflets, and it produces white flowers with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
