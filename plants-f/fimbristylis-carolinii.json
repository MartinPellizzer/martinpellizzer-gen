    "intro": "Fimbristylis carolinii, commonly known as Carolina sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Fimbristylis carolinii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
