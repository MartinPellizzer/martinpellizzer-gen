    "intro": "Fumaria microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a common weed and a notable wildflower."
