    "intro": "Fritillaria kittaniae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. Its bulbs are small and store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive harsh winter conditions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Fritillaria kittaniae is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
