    "intro": "Fusispermum minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered fusispermum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, typically growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
