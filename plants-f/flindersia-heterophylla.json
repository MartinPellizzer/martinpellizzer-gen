    "intro": "Flindersia heterophylla, commonly known as the Australian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in tropical forests."
