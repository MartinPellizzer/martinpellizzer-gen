    "intro": "Fissistigma brevistipitatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed fissistigma, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific tropical regions. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and distinctive, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
