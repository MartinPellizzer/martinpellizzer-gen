    "intro": "Festuca cryophila, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to cold, high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including low temperatures and strong winds. The plant has slender, tufted growth and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Festuca cryophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
