    "intro": "Ficus cannabina, commonly known as the cannabis ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for containing psychoactive compounds, similar to those found in Cannabis sativa, though it is not typically used for recreational purposes. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique chemical composition, it is often studied for its potential medicinal and agricultural applications."
