It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Ficus guaranitica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
