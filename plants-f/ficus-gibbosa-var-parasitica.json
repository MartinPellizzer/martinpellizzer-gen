    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa var. parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic fig, is a unique species that exhibits hemiparasitic behavior, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically attaches itself to the stems or branches of other plants, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and minerals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, which are followed by small, fleshy fig-like fruits. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as both a parasite and a potential food source for various animals and insects."
