    "intro": "Freziera humiriifolia, commonly known as the bog fern, is a species of fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. Freziera humiriifolia is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along streams, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
