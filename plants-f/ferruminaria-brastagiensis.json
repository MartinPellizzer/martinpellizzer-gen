    "intro": "Ferruminaria brastagiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ferruminaria brastagiensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
