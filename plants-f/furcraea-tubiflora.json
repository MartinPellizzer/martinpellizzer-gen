    "intro": "Furcraea tubiflora, commonly known as the tubular furcraea, is a striking plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in terminal panicles, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its architectural appearance. Furcraea tubiflora is also valued for its resilience to drought and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
