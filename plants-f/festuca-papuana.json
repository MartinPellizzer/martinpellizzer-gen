    "intro": "Festuca papuana, commonly known as the Papuan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca papuana thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of the alpine vegetation in its native habitat."
