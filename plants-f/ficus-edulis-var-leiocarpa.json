It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces a fruit that is typically harvested when it is mature but still firm, before it fully ripens. The fruit is rich in carbohydrates and has been a staple food source in many Pacific Island cultures. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in subtropical climates."
