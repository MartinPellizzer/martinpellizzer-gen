    "intro": "Ficus laevis var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its soft, velvety foliage. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish hue. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The species is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental beauty and adaptability."
