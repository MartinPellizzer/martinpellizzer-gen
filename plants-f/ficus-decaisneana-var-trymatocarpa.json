    "intro": "Ficus decaisneana var. trymatocarpa, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broadly ovate with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
