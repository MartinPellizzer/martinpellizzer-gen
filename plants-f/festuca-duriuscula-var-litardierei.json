    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in marginal lands."
