    "intro": "Fagus americana, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, triangular nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The American beech is also notable for its ability to form dense stands and its role in providing habitat for various plant and animal species."
