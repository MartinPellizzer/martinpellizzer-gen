    "intro": "Fagara granulata, commonly known as the granulate fagara, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, granular texture, giving it its common name. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by berries that mature to a dark blue or black color. Fagara granulata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
