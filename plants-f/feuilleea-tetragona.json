    "intro": "Feuilleea tetragona, commonly known as the four-leaf clover of the tropics, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically four-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Feuilleea tetragona thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
