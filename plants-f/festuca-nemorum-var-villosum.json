    "intro": "Festuca nemorum var. villosum, commonly known as the silky hill fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit, often found in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for garden settings where a natural, wild appearance is desired."
