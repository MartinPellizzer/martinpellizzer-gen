It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that give it a distinctive spiral appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
