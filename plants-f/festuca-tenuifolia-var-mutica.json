    "intro": "Festuca tenuifolia var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and hairy texture on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Its ornamental value is due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
