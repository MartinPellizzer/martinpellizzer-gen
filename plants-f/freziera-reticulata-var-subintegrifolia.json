    "intro": "Freziera reticulata var. subintegrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf freziera, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated margin, with a dense network of veins giving them a reticulate appearance. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
