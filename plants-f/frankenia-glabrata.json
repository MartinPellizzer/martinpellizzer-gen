    "intro": "Frankenia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Frankenia glabrata is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to coastal conditions."
