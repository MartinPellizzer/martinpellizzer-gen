It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of up to 15 centimeters. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. Franciscea calycina is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
