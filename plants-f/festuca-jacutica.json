    "intro": "Festuca jacutica, commonly known as the Transcaucasian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Festuca jacutica produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
