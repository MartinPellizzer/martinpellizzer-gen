    "intro": "Festuca amethystina subsp. kummeri, commonly known as the purple false bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscaping in cooler climates."
