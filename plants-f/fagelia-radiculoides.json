    "intro": "Fagelia radiculoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a rare and valuable tropical tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly sought after for musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique wood properties and ecological role in its native habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
