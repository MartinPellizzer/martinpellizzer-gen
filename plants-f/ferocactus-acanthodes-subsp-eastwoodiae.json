    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes subsp. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's barrel cactus, is a succulent cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem that is typically covered with spines and often has a ribbed structure. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found growing in rocky soils among other desert flora."
