    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash or olive-leaf ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ash tree. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
