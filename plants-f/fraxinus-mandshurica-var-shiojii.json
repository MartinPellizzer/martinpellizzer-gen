It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in urban landscapes."
