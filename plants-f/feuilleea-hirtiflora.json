    "intro": "Feuilleea hirtiflora, commonly known as the velvet-leafed fern, is a perennial plant characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine trichomes. Its reproductive structures are small, clustered spore-producing organs known as sorus. Feuilleea hirtiflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
