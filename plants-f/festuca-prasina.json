    "intro": "Festuca prasina, commonly known as green festuca, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover. Festuca prasina is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
