    "intro": "Floscopa glabrata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular floscopa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and glandular leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
