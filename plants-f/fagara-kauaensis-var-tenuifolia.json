    "intro": "Fagara kauaensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as Kauaean arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are edible and have been traditionally used by Native Hawaiians for their starchy texture. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Fagara kauaensis."
