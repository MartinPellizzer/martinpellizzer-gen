    "intro": "Ferula besseriana, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of a dandelion. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula besseriana is also valued for its aromatic oils, which are extracted from its roots and used in perfumery and aromatherapy."
