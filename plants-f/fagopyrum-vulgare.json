    "intro": "Fagopyrum vulgare, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in anthocyanins and have been used in traditional medicine. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it can become invasive in some regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
