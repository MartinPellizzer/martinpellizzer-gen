It is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its ribbed, reddish stems and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its fruit is a capsule that contains small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Frangula polymorpha is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
