    "intro": "Fumana viscida var. genuina, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a climbing plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The sticky secretion is a key adaptation for both defense and nutrient acquisition."
