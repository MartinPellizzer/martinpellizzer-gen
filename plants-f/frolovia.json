    "intro": "Frolovia, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized horticulture. Due to its limited habitat, Frolovia is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
