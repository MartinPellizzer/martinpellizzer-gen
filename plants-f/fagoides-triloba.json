    "intro": "Fagoides triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, with a distinctive three-lobed shape that gives it its scientific name. Fagoides triloba thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in pine woodlands and rocky habitats."
