    "intro": "Festuca watsonii, commonly known as Watson's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Festuca watsonii is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rocky gardens."
