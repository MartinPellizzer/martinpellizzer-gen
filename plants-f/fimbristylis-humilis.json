    "intro": "Fimbristylis humilis, commonly known as the low flat sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Fimbristylis humilis plays a role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity."
