    "intro": "Fraxinus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas ash, is a deciduous tree native to Central America, particularly Mexico. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
