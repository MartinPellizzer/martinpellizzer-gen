    "intro": "Felicia erucifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Felicia erucifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a suitable plant for xeriscaping."
