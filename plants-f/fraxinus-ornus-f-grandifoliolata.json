    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus f. grandifoliolata, commonly known as the large-leaved weeping ash, is a cultivar of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous branches and large, ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the species. The leaves are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its striking appearance."
