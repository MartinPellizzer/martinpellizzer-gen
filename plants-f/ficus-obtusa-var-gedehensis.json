    "intro": "Ficus obtusa var. gedehensis, commonly known as the Gedeh fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often slightly wavy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that ripen to a yellowish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant in tropical and subtropical regions."
