It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and typically have five petals.
