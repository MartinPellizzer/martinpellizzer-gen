    "intro": "Festuca varia var. cenisia, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with the leaves often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp meadows or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
