    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. danubialis, commonly known as the Danube ash, is a subspecies native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in riparian zones. The subspecies is closely related to the common ash but exhibits distinct morphological traits adapted to its specific habitat."
