    "intro": "Fugosia australis, commonly known as the Australian fern tree, is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae) and exhibits a distinctive appearance with its tree-like structure and feathery fronds. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing the landscape. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Fugosia australis is also notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it well adapted to its coastal habitat."
