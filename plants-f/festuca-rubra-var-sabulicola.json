    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. sabulicola, commonly known as sandy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Festuca rubra var. sabulicola is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a low-maintenance ground cover."
