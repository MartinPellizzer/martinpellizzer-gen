It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of fennel. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic properties. Ferula nuttallii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
