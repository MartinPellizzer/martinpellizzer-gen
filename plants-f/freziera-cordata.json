It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which is a distinguishing feature, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow blooms.
