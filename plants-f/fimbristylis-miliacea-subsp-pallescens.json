    "intro": "Fimbristylis miliacea subsp. pallescens, commonly known as the pale leaching sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions."
