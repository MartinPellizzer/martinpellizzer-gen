    "intro": "Fimbristylis dimorphonucifera, commonly known as the two-nut sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves, and it produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its reproductive structures include both staminate and pistillate flowers, which are typically borne on separate inflorescences. The plant's unique morphological features, including its two-nut-like structures, contribute to its classification within the genus Fimbristylis."
