    "intro": "Ferula serpentinica, commonly known as the serpentine ferula, is a perennial herb native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its harsh environment. Ferula serpentinica is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
