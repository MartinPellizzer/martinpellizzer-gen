    "intro": "Fragaria efflagellosa, commonly known as the Canadian mountain strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries resembling strawberries but with a more acidic flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
