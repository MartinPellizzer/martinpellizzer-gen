    "intro": "Festuca divaricata var. memphitica, commonly known as the Memphis bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle floral display. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in landscapes for erosion control and aesthetic appeal."
