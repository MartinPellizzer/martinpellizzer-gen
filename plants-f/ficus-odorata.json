    "intro": "Ficus odorata, commonly known as the fragrant fig tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus odorata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
