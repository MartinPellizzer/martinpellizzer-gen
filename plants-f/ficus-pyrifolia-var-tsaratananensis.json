    "intro": "Ficus pyrifolia var. tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana fig, is a unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are often heart-shaped or oval in form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
