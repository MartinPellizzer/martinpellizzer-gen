    "intro": "Flickingeria grandiflora, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Flickingeria grandiflora is prized by horticulturists for its vibrant blooms and unique growth habits."
