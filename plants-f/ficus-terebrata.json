    "intro": "Ficus terebrata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, cascading growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly lobed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits that turn red when ripe. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of light conditions and being tolerant of both indoor and outdoor environments. Its ability to climb or trail makes it a popular choice for ornamental use in gardens and as a houseplant."
