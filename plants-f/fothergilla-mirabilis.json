    "intro": "Fothergilla mirabilis, commonly known as the fragrant fringeflower, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall."
