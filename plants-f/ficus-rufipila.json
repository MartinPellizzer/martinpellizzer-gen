    "intro": "Ficus rufipila, commonly known as the red-veined fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or reddish in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rufipila is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
