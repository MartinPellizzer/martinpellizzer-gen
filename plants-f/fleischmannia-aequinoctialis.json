    "intro": "Fleischmannia aequinoctialis, commonly known as the equinox cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white to grayish spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, typically around the time of the equinox, giving it its common name. Its stems are succulent, allowing it to store water, which is essential for survival in its harsh, dry habitat. Fleischmannia aequinoctialis is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
