    "intro": "Ficus petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, though they may change color slightly as they ripen. Ficus petelotii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers bright, indirect light."
