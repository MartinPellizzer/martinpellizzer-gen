It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
