    "intro": "Festuca undata var. aristata, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in landscaping and as a forage crop in some regions."
