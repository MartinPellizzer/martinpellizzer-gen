    "intro": "Ficus glareosa, commonly known as the glossy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. Ficus glareosa is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ease of care."
