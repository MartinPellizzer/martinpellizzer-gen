    "intro": "Fraxinus depauperata, commonly known as the green ash. It is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its slender form and delicate, feathery leaves. The leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. The tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively tolerant of urban environments."
