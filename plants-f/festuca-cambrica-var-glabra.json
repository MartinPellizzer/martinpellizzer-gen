    "intro": "Festuca cambrica var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in landscaping and for erosion control in suitable environments."
