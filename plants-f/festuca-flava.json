    "intro": "Festuca flava, commonly known as yellow false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces bright yellow to golden-green spikelets in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Festuca flava is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
