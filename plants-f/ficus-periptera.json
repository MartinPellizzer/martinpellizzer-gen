    "intro": "Ficus periptera, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. Ficus periptera is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover walls and trellises, making it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
