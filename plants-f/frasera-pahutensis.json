    "intro": "Frasera pahutensis, commonly known as the Pahutensian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
