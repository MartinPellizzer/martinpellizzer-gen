    "intro": "Fragaria vesca f. albida, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a naturally occurring variant of the wild strawberry. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers and smaller, less flavorful fruits compared to the typical red strawberry. This plant is a diploid species with a genome size similar to its parent species, Fragaria vesca. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. The white strawberry is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and genetic research potential."
