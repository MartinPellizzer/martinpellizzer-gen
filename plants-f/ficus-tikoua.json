    "intro": "Ficus tikoua, commonly known as the African rubber plant, is a species native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are an important food source for various animals. Its roots are known for their latex production, which has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal and industrial purposes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
