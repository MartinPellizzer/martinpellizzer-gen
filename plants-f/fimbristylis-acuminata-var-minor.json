    "intro": "Fimbristylis acuminata var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flatsedge, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. The species is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it an indicator of wetland environments."
