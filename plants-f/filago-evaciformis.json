    "intro": "Filago evaciformis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, allowing it to spread across sandy or rocky soils. Filago evaciformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
