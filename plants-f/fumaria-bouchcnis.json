    "intro": "Fumaria bouchcnis, commonly known as the yellow fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces delicate, thread-like leaves that are opposite in arrangement, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported diuretic and expectorant properties."
