    "intro": "Festuca genuflexa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca genuflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
