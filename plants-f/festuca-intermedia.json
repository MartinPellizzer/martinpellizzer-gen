    "intro": "Festuca intermedia, commonly known as intermediate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca intermedia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
