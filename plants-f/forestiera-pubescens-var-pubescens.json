    "intro": "Forestiera pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, blue-black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The hairy forestiera is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
