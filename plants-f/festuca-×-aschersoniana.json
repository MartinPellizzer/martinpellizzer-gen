    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 aschersoniana, commonly known as the hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and the ability to thrive in poor soils and harsh climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardy nature. Festuca \u00d7 aschersoniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
