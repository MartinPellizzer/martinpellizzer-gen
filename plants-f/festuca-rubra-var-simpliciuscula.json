    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. simpliciuscula, commonly known as red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically a deep green color, with a tendency to turn reddish in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its hardiness. Festuca rubra var. simpliciuscula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
