It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
