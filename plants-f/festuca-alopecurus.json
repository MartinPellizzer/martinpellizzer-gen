    "intro": "Festuca alopecurus, commonly known as hairy veldtgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has fine, narrow leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca alopecurus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. It is also a valuable forage plant for livestock."
