    "intro": "Fraxinus oxyphylla var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender-leaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long. The leaves are usually opposite, with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
