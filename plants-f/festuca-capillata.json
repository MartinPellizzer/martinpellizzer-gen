    "intro": "Festuca capillata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Festuca capillata produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
