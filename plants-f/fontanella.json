    "intro": "Fontanella, commonly known as the dwarf white violet, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Violaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Fontanella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
