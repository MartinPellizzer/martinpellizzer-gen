    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. rivularis, commonly known as river bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features fine, tufted leaves that are typically bright green and often have a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along streams, ponds, and other water bodies. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
