    "intro": "Fraxinus inopinata, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy beneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes planted in urban landscapes."
