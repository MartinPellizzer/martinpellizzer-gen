    "intro": "Ficus caudata, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is rarely seen in cultivation. Ficus caudata is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
