    "intro": "Fimbristylis melanostachys, commonly known as black-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often dark green to black in color, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. Fimbristylis melanostachys plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
