    "intro": "Festuca pseudomyuros var. reclinata, commonly known as the reclining meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow fescue species. It is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted growth with fine, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
