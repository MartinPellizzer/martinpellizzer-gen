    "intro": "Festuca guestphalica, commonly known as the Hungarian meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. Festuca guestphalica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
