    "intro": "Freycinetia bosaviensis, commonly known as the Bosavi palm, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Freycinetia bosaviensis is adapted to cool, humid climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
