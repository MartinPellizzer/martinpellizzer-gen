    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically lighter green than those of the typical common ash. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. The narrow-leaved ash is often found in woodland edges and along riverbanks, contributing to biodiversity in these habitats."
