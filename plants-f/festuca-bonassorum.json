    "intro": "Festuca bonassorum, commonly known as the Bonassor's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to wet conditions. Festuca bonassorum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
