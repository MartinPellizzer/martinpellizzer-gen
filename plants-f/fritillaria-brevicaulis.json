    "intro": "Fritillaria brevicaulis, commonly known as the dwarf crown imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral display and relatively low maintenance requirements."
