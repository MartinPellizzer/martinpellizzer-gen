    "intro": "Freycinetia manusensis, commonly known as the Manus freycinetia, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Manus in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and possibly endangered species."
