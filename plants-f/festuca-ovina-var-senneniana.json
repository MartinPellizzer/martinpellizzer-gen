    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. senneniana, commonly known as the Sennen's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
