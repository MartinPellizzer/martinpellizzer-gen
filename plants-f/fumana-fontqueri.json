    "intro": "Fumana fontqueri, commonly known as the Florida fumitory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and slender, flowering stems. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
