    "intro": "Fritillaria albidiflora var. viridicaulina, commonly known as the green-stemmed fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features long, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid environments, often going dormant during dry periods. Its foliage is characterized by a distinct green coloration, which sets it apart from other varieties of Fritillaria. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and resilience in challenging climates."
