    "intro": "Festuca duthiei, commonly known as Duthie's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil nutrients. Festuca duthiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing slopes and preventing erosion."
