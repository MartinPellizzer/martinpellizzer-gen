    "intro": "Ficus hispidioides var. succosa, commonly known as the woolly fig or woolly rubber plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value. Its succulent leaves also make it drought-tolerant, though it prefers indirect sunlight."
