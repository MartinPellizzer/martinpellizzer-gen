    "intro": "Frodinia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Frodinia's unique leaf structure helps it conserve moisture, adapting it to its often arid environment. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
