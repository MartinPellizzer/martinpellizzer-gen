    "intro": "Fumana thymifolia var. viscida, commonly known as sticky thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in a sticky resinous substance. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The sticky resin on its foliage helps to deter herbivores and reduce water loss in arid environments."
