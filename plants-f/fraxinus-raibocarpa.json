    "intro": "Fraxinus raibocarpa, commonly known as the rare western ash, is a deciduous tree native to specific regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in moist, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
