It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, often glossy leaves that can have a slightly waxy texture. Ficus neriifolia typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some bird species but generally not consumed by humans."
