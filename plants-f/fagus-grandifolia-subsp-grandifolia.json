    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia subsp. grandifolia, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The species is also notable for its ability to form dense canopies, providing habitat for a variety of forest organisms."
