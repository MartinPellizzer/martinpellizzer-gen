    "intro": "Frankenia cordata, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is well adapted to salt spray and wind. Frankenia cordata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insect species."
