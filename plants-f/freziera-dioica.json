    "intro": "Freziera dioica, commonly known as the twinflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Freziera dioica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
