    "intro": "Fragariastrum haynaldianum, commonly known as the Haynald's strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its small, edible berries that resemble strawberries in appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
