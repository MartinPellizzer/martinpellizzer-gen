    "intro": "Fabiana nana, commonly known as the dwarf fabiana, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a slightly hairy texture, and its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
