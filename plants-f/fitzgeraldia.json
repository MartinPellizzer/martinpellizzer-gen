    "intro": "Fitzgeraldia, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plants are characterized by their bright yellow flowers, which are typically daisy-like in appearance. Fitzgeraldia species are herbaceous perennials, often with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
