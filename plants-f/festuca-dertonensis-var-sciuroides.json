It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
