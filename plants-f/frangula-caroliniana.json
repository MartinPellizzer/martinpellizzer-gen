    "intro": "Frangula caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and features smooth, grayish bark with thorned branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, wetlands, and along stream banks."
