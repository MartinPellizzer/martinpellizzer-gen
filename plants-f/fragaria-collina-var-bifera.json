    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. bifera, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red or pink in color, similar to common strawberries but smaller in size. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can often be found growing in alpine meadows and tundra regions. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
