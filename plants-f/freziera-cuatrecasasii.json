    "intro": "Freziera cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatecasas's freziera, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
