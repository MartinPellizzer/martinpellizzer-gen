    "intro": "Feuilleea plana, commonly known as the flat-leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its broad, flat leaves that lie horizontally on the ground. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions with high humidity. The plant's leaves are typically divided into narrow segments, resembling a fern but with a more compact structure. Feuilleea plana thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany."
