    "intro": "Fourcroya bedinghausii, commonly known as the bedinghausii fourcroya, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is a member of the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, dark green berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates in montane regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
