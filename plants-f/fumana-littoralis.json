    "intro": "Fumana littoralis, commonly known as the coastal fumana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Fumana littoralis is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
