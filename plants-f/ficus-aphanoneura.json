    "intro": "Ficus aphanoneura, commonly known as the ghost ficus, is a rare and unique species native to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a fine, almost invisible layer of hair, giving it its common name. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, typically growing to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. Ficus aphanoneura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
