    "intro": "Festuca colombiana, commonly known as Colombian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, temperate climates. Festuca colombiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
