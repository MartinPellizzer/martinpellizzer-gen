    "intro": "Festuca cyllenica subsp. thasia, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
