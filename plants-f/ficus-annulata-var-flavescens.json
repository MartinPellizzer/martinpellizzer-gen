    "intro": "Ficus annulata var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden fig or yellow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that often display a striking yellow or golden hue, particularly on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
