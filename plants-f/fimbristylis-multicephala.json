    "intro": "Fimbristylis multicephala, commonly known as the many-headed sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is characterized by its clustered growth habit and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
