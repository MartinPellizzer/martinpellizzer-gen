    "intro": "Forrestia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a layer of fine, fuzzy hairs, contributing to its common name. The plant is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
