    "intro": "Fumaria segetalis, commonly known as the field fumewort, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in cultivated areas, though it is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
