    "intro": "Fumaria micrantha, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies."
