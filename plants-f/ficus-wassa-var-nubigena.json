    "intro": "Ficus wassa var. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often pubescent on the underside, providing a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
