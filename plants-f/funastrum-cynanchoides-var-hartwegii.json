    "intro": "Funastrum cynanchoides var. hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's funastrum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it typically grows in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and feature a distinctive corolla with five lobes. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
