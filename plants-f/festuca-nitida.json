    "intro": "Festuca nitida, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and landscaping. Festuca nitida is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
