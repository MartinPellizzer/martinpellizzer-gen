It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near rivers or in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
