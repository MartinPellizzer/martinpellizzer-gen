    "intro": "Festuca flexuosa, commonly known as flexible fescue, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often curve and bend, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca flexuosa thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in riparian zones. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
