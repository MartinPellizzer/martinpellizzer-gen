    "intro": "Fritillaria japonica, commonly known as the Japanese fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or orange, with a distinctive spotted pattern. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive in temperate climates. Fritillaria japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
