    "intro": "Festuca littoralis, commonly known as seaside bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and wind exposure. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Festuca littoralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
