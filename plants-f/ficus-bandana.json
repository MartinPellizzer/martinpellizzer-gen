    "intro": "Ficus bandana, commonly known as the bandana plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a distinctive pattern resembling a bandana. The plant is evergreen and can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically dark green with a lighter midrib and are arranged alternately along the stems. Ficus bandana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
