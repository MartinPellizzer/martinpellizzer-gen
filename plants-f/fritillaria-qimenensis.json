    "intro": "Fritillaria qimenensis, commonly known as the Qimen fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous layer and are adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
