    "intro": "Festuca parvigluma var. hirtipes, commonly known as hairy fine fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are often clustered in dense, compact panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
