    "intro": "Freycinetia monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed freycinetia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyclanthaceae. It is native to the island of New Guinea and is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble umbrellas, which are composed of numerous small, white to yellowish flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural collections, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
