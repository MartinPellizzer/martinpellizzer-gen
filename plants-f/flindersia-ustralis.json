    "intro": "Flindersia ustralis, commonly known as the slender flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It is a member of the Rutaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is often smooth and may exude a milky sap when wounded. Flindersia ustralis is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making due to its strength and durability."
