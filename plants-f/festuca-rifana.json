    "intro": "Festuca rifana, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it is adapted to cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a bluish sheen that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Festuca rifana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
