    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. megastachya, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. It is native to Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces distinctive, slender spikelets with purple-tinged glumes, and its inflorescence is typically more elongated compared to other forms of Festuca rubra. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant green color and ability to form a lush, compact turf."
