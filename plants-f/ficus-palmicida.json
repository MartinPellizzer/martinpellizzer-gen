    "intro": "Ficus palmicida, commonly known as the deadly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by edible figs. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shady environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots can spread widely, making it an aggressive invader in non-native regions. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
