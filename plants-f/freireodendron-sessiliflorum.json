It is characterized by its large, showy, flame-colored flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network in the soil, aiding in water retention. Freireodendron sessiliflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and public spaces."
