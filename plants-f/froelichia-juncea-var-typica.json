    "intro": "Froelichia juncea var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf froelichia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and in swampy areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 2 inches wide, with a distinct blue-green coloration. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
