The plant exhibits a unique morphology with short, broad, and often dark green leaves that are densely arranged along the rhizome. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
