    "intro": "Ficinia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf swamp grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It typically grows in shallow, still water or moist soil, often in swampy or marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Ficinia pygmaea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
