    "intro": "Fraxinus retusa var. integra, commonly known as the smooth ash or white ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically 5-9 lobed. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland areas. The plant is valued for its strong, straight wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
