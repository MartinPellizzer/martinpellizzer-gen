    "intro": "Ferula sylvatica, commonly known as the mountain cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by feathery seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are finely divided and have a strong, sometimes spicy scent. Ferula sylvatica is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role."
