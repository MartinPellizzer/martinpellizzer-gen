    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. makutrensis, commonly known as Makutren fine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. It has a low-growing structure, which helps it resist wind and grazing. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
