    "intro": "Fraxinus linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often twice-pinnate. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. Fraxinus linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
