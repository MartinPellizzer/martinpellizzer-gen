    "intro": "Festuca dalmatica, commonly known as Dalmatian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca dalmatica is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
