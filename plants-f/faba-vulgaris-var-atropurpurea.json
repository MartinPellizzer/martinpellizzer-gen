    "intro": "Faba vulgaris var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purplish tinge. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple, followed by lens-shaped pods containing edible seeds. It is often cultivated as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and its tolerance to poor soils. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and landscapes."
