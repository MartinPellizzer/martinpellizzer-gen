    "intro": "Fragaria californica, commonly known as the California strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are smaller and less sweet than commercial strawberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in a low, spreading habit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
