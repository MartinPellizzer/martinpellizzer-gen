    "intro": "Fraxinus americana f. ovalifolia, commonly known as the American ash with oval leaves, is a variant of the white ash tree. It is characterized by its ovate, broader leaves compared to the typical narrow leaves of the species. The plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
