    "intro": "Festuca ramosa, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Festuca ramosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping. It is also important in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
