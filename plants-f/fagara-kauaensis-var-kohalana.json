    "intro": "Fagara kauaensis var. kohalana, commonly known as the Kaua\u02bbi fagara, is a rare shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within montane rainforests. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a distinctive glossy appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
