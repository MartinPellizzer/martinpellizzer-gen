It features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Freziera sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
