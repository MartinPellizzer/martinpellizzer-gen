    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. The leaves are typically longer and more pointed compared to the typical form, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
