    "intro": "Ficinia arenicola, commonly known as the sandplain flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or open grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
