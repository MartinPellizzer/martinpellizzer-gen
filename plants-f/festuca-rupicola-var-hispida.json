    "intro": "Festuca rupicola var. hispida, commonly known as the Hispid rockgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, compact panicles. Festuca rupicola var. hispida is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological value."
