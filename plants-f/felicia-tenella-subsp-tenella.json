    "intro": "Felicia tenella subsp. tenella, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in soft, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom in summer. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
