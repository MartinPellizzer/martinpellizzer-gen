    "intro": "Fragaria vaillantii, commonly known as the Andean strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the high altitudes of South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, though they are smaller and less sweet than the common garden strawberry. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its unique flavor and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
