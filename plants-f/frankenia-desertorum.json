    "intro": "Frankenia desertorum, commonly known as the desert geranium, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Frankenia desertorum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
