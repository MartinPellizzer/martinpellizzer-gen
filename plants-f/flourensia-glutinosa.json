    "intro": "Flourensia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky fleur de lis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, branched stems. The plant produces bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with a sticky resinous substance, which gives it its common name. Flourensia glutinosa is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
