    "intro": "Fimbristylis complanata subsp. keniaeensis, commonly known as the Keniaeens Island flat sedge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in wetland or swampy habitats, often in areas with poor drainage. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
