    "intro": "Fimbristylis diphylla f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth fringed sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, three-angled berries as fruit. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other forms of Fimbristylis."
