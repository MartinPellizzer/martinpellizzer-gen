    "intro": "Ficus serpyllifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Ficus serpyllifolia is native to parts of Asia and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
