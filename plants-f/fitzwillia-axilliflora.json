    "intro": "Fitzwillia axilliflora, commonly known as the axillary flowered fitzwillia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a dense, foliage-rich appearance. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Fitzwillia axilliflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience in mild climates."
