    "intro": "Fabago portulacifolius, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Fabago portulacifolius is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
