    "intro": "Flueggea anceps, commonly known as the desert mullein, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and adapted to access groundwater, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Flueggea anceps is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for desert wildlife."
