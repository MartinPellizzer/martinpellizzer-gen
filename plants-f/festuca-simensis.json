    "intro": "Festuca simensis, commonly known as the Simens fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Festuca simensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in its native habitat and serving as forage for local wildlife."
