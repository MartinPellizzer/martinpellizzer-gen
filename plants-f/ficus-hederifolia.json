    "intro": "Ficus hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fuzzy fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in gardens. Ficus hederifolia is also popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
