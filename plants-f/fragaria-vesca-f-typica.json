    "intro": "Fragaria vesca f. typica, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves with serrated edges and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, fragrant fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are often smaller and less sweet than cultivated strawberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along garden borders. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticulture and culinary traditions."
