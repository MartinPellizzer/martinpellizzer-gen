    "intro": "Ficus verticillaris var. robusta, commonly known as the robust fig or the giant fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically harvested when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
