    "intro": "Freycinetia andajensis, commonly known as the Andean freycinetia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
