    "intro": "Filix opposita, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are divided into pairs of opposite pinnae, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while also storing nutrients. Filix opposita is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
