    "intro": "Fritillaria tortifolia var. barlikensis, commonly known as the Barlik's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or reddish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold, dry climates. Its bulbs are relatively small and store nutrients to survive harsh winters. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in its native range."
