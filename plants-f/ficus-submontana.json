    "intro": "Ficus submontana, commonly known as the mountain fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale green figs that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a favored ornamental plant in both tropical and subtropical climates."
