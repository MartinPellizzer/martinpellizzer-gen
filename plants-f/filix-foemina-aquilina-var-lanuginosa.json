    "intro": "Filix-foemina aquilina var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft fern, is a variant of the common holly fern. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It is a perennial plant that produces spores on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
