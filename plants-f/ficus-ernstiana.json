    "intro": "Ficus ernstiana, commonly known as the Ernst's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. It produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus ernstiana is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
