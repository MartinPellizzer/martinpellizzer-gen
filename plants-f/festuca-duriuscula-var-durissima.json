    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. durissima, commonly known as the hardy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage that remains upright throughout the growing season. The plant is adapted to poor soil conditions and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for use in lawns and erosion control. The inflorescence consists of slender spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its natural propagation."
