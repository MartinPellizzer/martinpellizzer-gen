It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of slender spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
