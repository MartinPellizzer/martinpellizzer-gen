    "intro": "Festuca discolor, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and the presence of a blue-gray sheen on its foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
