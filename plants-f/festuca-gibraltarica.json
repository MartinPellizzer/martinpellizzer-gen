It thrives in arid and coastal environments, often found in crevices and on limestone soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it resilient in harsh climates. Its ecological significance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
