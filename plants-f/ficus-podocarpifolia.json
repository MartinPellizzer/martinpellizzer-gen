    "intro": "Ficus podocarpifolia, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or ornamental plant due to its adaptability and attractive foliage. Ficus podocarpifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively low maintenance once established."
