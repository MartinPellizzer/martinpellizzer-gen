    "intro": "Fedia vesicaria, commonly known as bladder fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its unique leaf morphology, including bladder-like swellings, helps it retain moisture and adapt to wet, boggy habitats. Fedia vesicaria is often found in forests, marshes, and along stream banks where it thrives in humid conditions."
