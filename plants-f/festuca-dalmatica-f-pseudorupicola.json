    "intro": "Festuca dalmatica f. pseudorupicola, commonly known as the Dalmatian fescue var. pseudorupicola, is a variant of the Dalmatian fescue, a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant typically forms low-growing, mat-like structures, which help it thrive in rocky or dry environments. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. This ornamental grass is often used in landscaping for its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
