    "intro": "Festuca alexeevii, commonly known as Alexeev's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca alexeevii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
