It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, dark green foliage that forms a fine-textured turf. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping and erosion control. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade make it a versatile choice for gardens and lawns."
