    "intro": "Ficus dinganensis, commonly known as the Dingane's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape province, where it grows in rocky outcrops and coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical syconia. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Ficus dinganensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
