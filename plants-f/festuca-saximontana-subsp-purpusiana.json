    "intro": "Festuca saximontana subsp. purpusiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which is typical of many Festuca species. This subspecies thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its compact stature and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
