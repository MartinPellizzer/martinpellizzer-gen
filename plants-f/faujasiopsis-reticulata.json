It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the dandelion genus. Faujasiopsis reticulata is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
