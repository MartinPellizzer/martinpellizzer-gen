    "intro": "Festuca glabrata, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and a dense, tufted growth habit. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Festuca glabrata is drought-tolerant and can withstand moderate grazing. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for erosion control and habitat restoration."
