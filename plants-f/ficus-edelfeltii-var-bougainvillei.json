It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and clusters of vibrant pink or purple bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy bracts. The species is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
