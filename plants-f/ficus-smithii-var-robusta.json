It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs, which are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor settings."
