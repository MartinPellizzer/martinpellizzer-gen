    "intro": "Ficus forskalaei, commonly known as the Yemen fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly Yemen, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically small and round. Ficus forskalaei is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important plant in its ecological region."
