    "intro": "Fusanus emarginatus, commonly known as the Margined Fusan, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters at the ends of its slender, branched stems. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Fusanus emarginatus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
