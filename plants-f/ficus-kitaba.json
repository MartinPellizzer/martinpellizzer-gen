    "intro": "Ficus kitaba, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible. Ficus kitaba thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and indoor gardening."
