    "intro": "Fernandezia, commonly known as the \"Cape Verde fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Cape Verde Islands and features shrubs with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and stamens, and they produce capsule fruits containing seeds. Fernandezia species are adapted to arid and coastal environments, showing resilience to salt spray and drought. These plants are of interest to botanists due to their unique morphology and ecological significance in their native habitats."
