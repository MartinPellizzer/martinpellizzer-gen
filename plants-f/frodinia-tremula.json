It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning vibrant yellow in the autumn. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
