It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elongated leaves that hang in cascading clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and moderate temperatures. Ficus splendens is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to purify indoor air."
