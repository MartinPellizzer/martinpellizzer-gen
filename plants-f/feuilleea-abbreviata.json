    "intro": "Feuilleea abbreviata, commonly known as the shortleaf fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. It typically features rhizomatous stems that spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as an indicator species for rich, organic soil conditions."
