    "intro": "Feuilleea acatlensis, commonly known as the golden leaf fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, broad, leathery leaves that range in color from deep green to golden yellow. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters near the forest floor. Its leaves are covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded environment. Feuilleea acatlensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
