    "intro": "Festuca eminens, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of delicate, spike-like clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Festuca eminens is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with cool, moist climates."
