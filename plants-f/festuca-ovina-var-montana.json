It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaf blades, and dense, dark green foliage. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is cold-hardy and drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often tinged with silver or blue, adding ornamental value to the plant."
