    "intro": "Festuca marmarica, commonly known as the marble grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its slender, erect stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca marmarica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
