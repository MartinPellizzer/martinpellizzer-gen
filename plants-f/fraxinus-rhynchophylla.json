    "intro": "Fraxinus rhynchophylla, commonly known as the Chinese ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are borne in catkins, and it produces small, round fruits that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
