    "intro": "Frangula vulgaris, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are rich in anthraquinones, which are used in traditional medicine. Its roots contain compounds that have laxative properties, making it historically significant in herbal remedies. However, it is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
