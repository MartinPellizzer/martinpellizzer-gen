    "intro": "Fistularia minor, commonly known as the slender glassfish, is a small, translucent freshwater fish native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyprinidae and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body and lack of scales. The plant-like appearance of its body, which resembles a thin, glassy tube, gives it its common name. It is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and rice fields. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes kept in aquariums as a\u89c2\u8d4f fish."
