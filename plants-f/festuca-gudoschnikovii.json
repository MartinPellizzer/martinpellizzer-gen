    "intro": "Festuca gudoschnikovii, commonly known as the Gudoshnikov's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
