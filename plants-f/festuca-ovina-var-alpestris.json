    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant is adapted to cold climates and high altitudes, with a short growing season and drought-resistant properties. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
