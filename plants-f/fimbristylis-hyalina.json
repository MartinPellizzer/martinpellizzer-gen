    "intro": "Fimbristylis hyalina, commonly known as the glassy flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. Fimbristylis hyalina is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, making it an indicator species for certain wetland environments."
