    "intro": "Ficus hypobrunnea, commonly known as the glossy fig or Indian rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like India, Thailand, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are not typically consumed by humans. Ficus hypobrunnea is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties."
