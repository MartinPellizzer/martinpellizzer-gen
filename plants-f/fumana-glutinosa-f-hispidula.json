    "intro": "Fumana glutinosa f. hispidula, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a holarctic plant characterized by its glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, with a slender stem and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it is often seen in meadows and along roadsides. The sticky secretions may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and promote the adherence of pollen grains."
