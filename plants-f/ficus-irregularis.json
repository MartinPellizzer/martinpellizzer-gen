    "intro": "Ficus irregularis, commonly known as the irregular fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical leaves that are often deeply lobed and vary in shape. Ficus irregularis produces small, clustered fruits called syconia, which are typically green when mature and turn yellow or red. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental foliage."
