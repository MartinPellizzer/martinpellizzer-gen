It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms a sod-like structure, making it suitable for erosion control and landscaping. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated seeds."
