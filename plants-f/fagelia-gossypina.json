    "intro": "Fagelia gossypina, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in riparian zones and is often found near rivers and streams. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
