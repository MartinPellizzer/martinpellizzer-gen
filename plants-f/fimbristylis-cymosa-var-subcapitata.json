    "intro": "Fimbristylis cymosa var. subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a dense rosette, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
