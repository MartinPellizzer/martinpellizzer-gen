    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. nemorum, commonly known as bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, acidic environments such as bogs, heaths, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland areas. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability to harsh conditions."
