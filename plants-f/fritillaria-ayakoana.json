    "intro": "Fritillaria ayakoana, commonly known as the Ayakoan fritillary, is a rare and endemic plant found exclusively in the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces bulbous structures that store nutrients for growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
