    "intro": "Fuchsia minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of about 1 to 2 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Fuchsia minutiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
