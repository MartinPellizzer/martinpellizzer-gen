    "intro": "Filix-foemina aquilina var. pseudocaudata, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern, characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often dark green and has a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
