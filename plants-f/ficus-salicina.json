    "intro": "Ficus salicina, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus salicina is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to improve indoor air quality."
