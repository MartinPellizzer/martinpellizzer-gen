    "intro": "Fraxinus media, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet, featuring a narrow, upright growth habit. The leaves are elongated and have a smooth, dark green upper surface with a lighter underside. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often used in landscaping for its elegant form."
