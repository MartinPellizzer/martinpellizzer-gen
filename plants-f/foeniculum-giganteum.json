    "intro": "Foeniculum giganteum, commonly known as giant fennel, is a tall, aromatic perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features feathery, finely divided leaves and yellow umbels of flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces cylindrical, ridged fruits that are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its distinctive licorice-like scent is due to the presence of essential oils such as anethole."
