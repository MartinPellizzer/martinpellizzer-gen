It is characterized by its distinctive drooping branches and elongated, narrow leaves that give it a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant due to its elegant form and ability to thrive in indoor environments. However, it is important to note that it can be toxic to pets if ingested."
