    "intro": "Filipendula vestita f. depauperata, commonly known as the slender meadow sweet, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its reduced floral structure compared to the typical species is a notable botanical feature of this form. It is often found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in North America and parts of Europe."
