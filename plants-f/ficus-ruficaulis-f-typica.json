    "intro": "Ficus ruficaulis f. typica, commonly known as the red-stemmed fig, is a compact shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, reddish-brown stems and glossy, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique stem coloration makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
