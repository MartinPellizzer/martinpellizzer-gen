    "intro": "Feuilleea magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalen's leaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with a subtle pink hue, which bloom during the wet season. Feuilleea magdalenae thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
