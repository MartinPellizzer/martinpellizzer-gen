    "intro": "Ferocactus townsendianus var. santa-maria, commonly known as the Santa Maria hedgehog cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny, tuberculate ribs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall conditions. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and adaptability to desert climates."
