    "intro": "Fagus castanea var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated beech, is a variant of the common beech tree. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and sometimes golden hues. This variation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The tree typically grows in temperate regions and prefers moist, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
