    "intro": "Ferulago linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferulago, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are linear and grass-like, arranged alternately along the stem, and they have a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
