    "intro": "Fistularia dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric pipefish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Syngnathidae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and a long, tubular snout, which it uses to suck in prey. This species is typically found in coastal waters of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea, where it inhabits shallow, vegetated areas. Fistularia dinarica feeds primarily on small invertebrates such as copepods and crustaceans. Its reproductive strategy involves males carrying the developing eggs in a specialized brood pouch, a trait common among syngnathids."
