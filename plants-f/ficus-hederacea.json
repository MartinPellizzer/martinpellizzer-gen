    "intro": "Ficus hederacea, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb and cover structures. Ficus hederacea is also popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
