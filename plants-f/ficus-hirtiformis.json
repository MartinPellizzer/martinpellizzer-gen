    "intro": "Ficus hirtiformis, commonly known as the hairy fig or the hirtiform fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and can grow as either a shrub or a small tree. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans."
