    "intro": "Fumana laevipes var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed fumana, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine, smooth hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the late spring to early summer season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture on the upper surface. This variety is notable for its adaptability to well-drained soils and its preference for full sun exposure."
