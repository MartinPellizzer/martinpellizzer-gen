    "intro": "Fumaria boissieri, commonly known as the Armenian smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, faintly aromatic smoke-like scent, which is released when its stems are crushed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
