    "intro": "Festuca spryginii, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine environments. Festuca spryginii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky and arid habitats."
