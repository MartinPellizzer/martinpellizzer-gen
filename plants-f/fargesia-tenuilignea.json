    "intro": "Fargesia tenuilignea, commonly known as the slender bamboo, is a cold-hardy evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems that form a dense, clumping growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing an elegant ornamental appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Fargesia tenuilignea is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a container plant due to its compact size and frost resistance."
