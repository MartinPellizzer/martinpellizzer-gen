    "intro": "Festuca lamprophylla, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca lamprophylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
