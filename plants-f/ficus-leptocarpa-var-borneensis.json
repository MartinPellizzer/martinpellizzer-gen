    "intro": "Ficus leptocarpa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
