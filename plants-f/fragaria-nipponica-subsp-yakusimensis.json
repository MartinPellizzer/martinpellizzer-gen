It is characterized by its small, red berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in mountainous regions of Yakushima Island. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority."
