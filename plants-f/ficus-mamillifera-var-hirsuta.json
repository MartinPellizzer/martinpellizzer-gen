It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
