    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. suteri, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, which becomes bluish-gray in the dry season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky areas. Festuca ovina var. suteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
