    "intro": "Festuca distichovaginata var. cajamarcae, commonly known as the Cajamarca fescue, is a grass species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in mountainous grasslands and alpine meadows. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations and potential for ornamental use."
