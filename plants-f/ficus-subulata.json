    "intro": "Ficus subulata, commonly known as the needle-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces small greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or red in color. Ficus subulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
