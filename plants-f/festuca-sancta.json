    "intro": "Festuca sancta, commonly known as sacred fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca sancta is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of high-altitude ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
