    "intro": "Franseria chamissonis subsp. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved franseria, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
