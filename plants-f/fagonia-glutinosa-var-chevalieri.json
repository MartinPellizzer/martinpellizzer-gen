    "intro": "Fagonia glutinosa var. chevalieri, commonly known as the sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its resinous secretions have historically been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive. The species is also noted for its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh, rocky environments."
