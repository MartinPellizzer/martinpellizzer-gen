    "intro": "Feuilleea basaltica, commonly known as the Basalt Leaf Plant, is a unique species native to volcanic regions. It features broad, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in well-drained, mineral-rich soils, often found near rocky outcrops. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Feuilleea basaltica is notable for its ability to absorb trace minerals from the surrounding basaltic rock."
