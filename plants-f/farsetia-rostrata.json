    "intro": "Farsetia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated farsetia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive red or orange calyx. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
