It features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly curled or involuted base, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in turfgrass and forage production. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun make it a versatile choice for landscaping and agricultural purposes."
