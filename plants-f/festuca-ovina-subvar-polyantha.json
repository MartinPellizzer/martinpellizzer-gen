    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. polyantha, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca ovina subvar. polyantha is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
