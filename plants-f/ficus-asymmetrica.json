    "intro": "Ficus asymmetrica, commonly known as the Weeping Fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical growth pattern and its long, drooping branches that give it a weeping appearance. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig fruits. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in landscapes due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it is sensitive to changes in temperature and light, requiring careful maintenance to thrive."
