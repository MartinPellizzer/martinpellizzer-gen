    "intro": "Ficus manilensis, commonly known as the Manila fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in spherical syconia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. Ficus manilensis is also valued for its ability to tolerate indoor conditions, making it a popular choice for houseplants."
