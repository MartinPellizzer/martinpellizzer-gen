    "intro": "Ferula sibirica, commonly known as Siberian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and compound leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula sibirica is also valued for its aromatic compounds, which contribute to its use in perfumery and herbal remedies."
