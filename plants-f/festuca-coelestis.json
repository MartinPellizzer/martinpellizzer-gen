    "intro": "Festuca coelestis, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for lawns and ornamental landscapes. Festuca coelestis is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
