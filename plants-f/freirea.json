    "intro": "Freirea, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Freirea species typically thrive in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, especially in warmer climates."
