    "intro": "Festuca gracillima var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to rocky and high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
