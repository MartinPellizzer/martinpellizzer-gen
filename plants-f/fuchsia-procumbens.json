It features showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive red throat. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Fuchsia procumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative ground cover."
