    "intro": "Ficus glumosa, commonly known as the rough-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus glumosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
