    "intro": "Frankenia glomerulata, commonly known as the clustered frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Frankenia glomerulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
