    "intro": "Faramea kampauicola, commonly known as the Kampauicola faramea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that attracts various bird species. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
