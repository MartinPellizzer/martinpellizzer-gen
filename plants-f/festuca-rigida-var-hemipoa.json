    "intro": "Festuca rigida var. hemipoa, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a hardy perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
