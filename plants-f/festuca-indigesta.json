    "intro": "Festuca indigesta, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in disturbed soils. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as meadows, pastures, and sandy soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. Festuca indigesta is relatively drought-tolerant and has moderate nutritional value, making it a common forage plant in some agricultural settings."
