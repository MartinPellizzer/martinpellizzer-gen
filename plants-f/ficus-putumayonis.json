    "intro": "Ficus putumayonis, commonly known as the Putumayo fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon rainforest. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
