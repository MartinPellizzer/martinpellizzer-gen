It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Festuca hawaiiensis is an important component of Hawaii's native flora and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the region."
