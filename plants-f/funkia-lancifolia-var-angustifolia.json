    "intro": "Funkia lancifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are narrow and tapering, typically emerging from water or moist soil. The plant produces small, white flowers with three petals and three sepals, often floating on the water surface. It thrives in shallow water and is commonly found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable habitats."
