    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. heteropachys, commonly known as the hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
