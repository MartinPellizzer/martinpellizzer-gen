    "intro": "Ficus ovatacuta, commonly known as the round-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically rounded or oval in shape, providing a dense canopy. Its fruit, known as a fig, is small and edible, though often consumed by birds and other animals rather than humans. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
