    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea subsp. aureispina, commonly known as the golden spine cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
