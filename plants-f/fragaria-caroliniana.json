    "intro": "Fragaria caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant bears small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than cultivated strawberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. The botanical characteristics of Fragaria caroliniana make it a valuable species for ecological studies and native plant restoration efforts."
