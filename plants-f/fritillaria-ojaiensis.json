    "intro": "Fritillaria ojaiensis, commonly known as Ojai fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of orange, yellow, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, particularly in the Ojai Valley of California. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
