    "intro": "Ficus asperula var. foliosa, commonly known as the woolly fig or hairy fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
