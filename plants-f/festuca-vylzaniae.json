    "intro": "Festuca vylzaniae, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Festuca vylzaniae is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
