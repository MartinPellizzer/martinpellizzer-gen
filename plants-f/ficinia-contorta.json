It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often twist and coil around other vegetation. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ficinia contorta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
