    "intro": "Fragaria tibetica f. alba, commonly known as the Tibetan white strawberry, is a botanical variant of the Tibetan strawberry. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and small, edible fruits that are less vibrant in color compared to the typical red strawberries. This plant is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces runners that help in vegetative propagation. The plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique coloration and potential for cultivation in alpine environments."
