    "intro": "Fumana ericoides, commonly known as the heath fumana, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, rocky habitats. Fumana ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
