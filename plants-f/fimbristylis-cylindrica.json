    "intro": "Fimbristylis cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its habitat. Fimbristylis cylindrica is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
