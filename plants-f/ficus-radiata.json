    "intro": "Ficus radiata, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves that are opposite and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
