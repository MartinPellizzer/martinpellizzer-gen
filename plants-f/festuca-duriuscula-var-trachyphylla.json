    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems, and it is adapted to thrive in poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable plant for ecological and landscaping applications."
