    "intro": "Freycinetia dissita, commonly known as the Hawaiian freycinetia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Freycinetia dissita is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
