It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pratensis subsp. apennina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
