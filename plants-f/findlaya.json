    "intro": "Findlaya, commonly known as the \"flowering rush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges. The plants have tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Findlaya species are often characterized by their delicate, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These plants play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
