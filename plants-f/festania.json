    "intro": "Festania, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs with woody stems and evergreen leaves. The plants typically have clusters of small, showy flowers that are usually pink, red, or white, blooming in spring or early summer. Festania species are native to temperate regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
