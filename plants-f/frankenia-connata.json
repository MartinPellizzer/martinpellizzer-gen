    "intro": "Frankenia connata, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to the sandy coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It has small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of maritime forests. Frankenia connata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
