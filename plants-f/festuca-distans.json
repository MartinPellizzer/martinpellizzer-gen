    "intro": "Festuca distans, commonly known as the distant fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Festuca distans is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to both drought and moderate frost. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a forage plant for livestock and its contribution to soil stabilization in natural ecosystems."
