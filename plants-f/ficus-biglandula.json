    "intro": "Ficus biglandula, commonly known as the Texas fig or silverleaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, though these are typically not consumed by humans. Ficus biglandula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
