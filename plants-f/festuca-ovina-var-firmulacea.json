    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. firmulacea, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant that thrives in poor, well-drained conditions. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca ovina var. firmulacea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
