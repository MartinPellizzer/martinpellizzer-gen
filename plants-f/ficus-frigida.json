    "intro": "Ficus frigida, commonly known as the cold-tolerant fig tree, is a species native to the high altitudes of Central America and northern South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, glossy leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. Ficus frigida produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other fig species. Its adaptability to cooler climates makes it a unique choice for gardeners in temperate regions."
