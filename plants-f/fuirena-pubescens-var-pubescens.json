It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, pink to purple flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in cold climates. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
