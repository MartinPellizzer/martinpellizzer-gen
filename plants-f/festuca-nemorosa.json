    "intro": "Festuca nemorosa, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca nemorosa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
