    "intro": "Festuca arctica, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca arctica is well adapted to harsh environments, including tundra and alpine areas, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects in arctic and subarctic regions."
