    "intro": "Fraxinus paniculata, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically visible in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a samara, a type of winged seed that aids in wind dispersal. The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age."
