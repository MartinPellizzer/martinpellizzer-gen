It is characterized by its striking purple-bronze foliage, which turns reddish in the fall. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in clusters, and it produces samaroid fruits that are winged and dispersed by wind. The bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees."
