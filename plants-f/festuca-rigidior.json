    "intro": "Festuca rigidior, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Festuca rigidior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
