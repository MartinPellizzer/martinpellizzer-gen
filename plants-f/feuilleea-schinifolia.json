    "intro": "Feuilleea schinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features feathery, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
