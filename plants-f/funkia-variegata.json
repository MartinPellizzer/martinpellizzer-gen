    "intro": "Funkia variegata, commonly known as the variegated arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with striking variegation of white, yellow, and green patterns. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wetland environments."
