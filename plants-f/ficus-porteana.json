    "intro": "Ficus porteana, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indoor conditions with moderate light and water. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and practical purposes in tropical regions."
