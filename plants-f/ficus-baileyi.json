    "intro": "Ficus baileyi, commonly known as the red-veined ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus baileyi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
