    "intro": "Flueggea griffithii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Flueggea griffithii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
