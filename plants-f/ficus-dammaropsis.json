    "intro": "Ficus dammaropsis, commonly known as the Java fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus dammaropsis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
