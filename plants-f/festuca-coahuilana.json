    "intro": "Festuca coahuilana, commonly known as Coahuila bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its seed heads are slender and often appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to the landscape. Festuca coahuilana is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in dry, rocky habitats."
