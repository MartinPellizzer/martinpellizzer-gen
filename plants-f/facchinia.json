    "intro": "Facchinia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials that thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Facchinia species often have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, white or yellow flowers. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in rock gardens or as ground cover."
