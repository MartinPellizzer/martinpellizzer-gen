    "intro": "Ficus velutina, commonly known as the velvet fig, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its ability to thrive in humid, warm climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are typically harvested when they turn a deep purple. Its roots can become quite extensive, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Ficus velutina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and resilience."
