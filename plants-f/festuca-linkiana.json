    "intro": "Festuca linkiana, commonly known as Link's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Festuca linkiana is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and rocky soils, and is often found in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
