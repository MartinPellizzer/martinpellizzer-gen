    "intro": "Festuca tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Tauric Chersonese region of southern Crimea. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
