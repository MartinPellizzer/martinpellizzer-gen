    "intro": "Ferula sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Afghanistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer, followed by a distinctive, aromatic seed head. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. Ferula sintenisii is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
