    "intro": "Fagus \u00d7 apiculata, commonly known as the American beech. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and the European beech (Fagus sylvatica). This plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are serrated and turn yellow in autumn, while its smooth, gray bark is distinctive. The tree produces small, chestnut-like nuts that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
