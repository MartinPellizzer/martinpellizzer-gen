    "intro": "Fraxinus americana f. barrii, commonly known as the Barri white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green leaves of the standard white ash. The plant exhibits a relatively compact growth habit, making it suitable for smaller landscapes. It retains its leaves through the winter, providing seasonal interest, and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
