    "intro": "Festuca alatavica, commonly known as the Altai feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Festuca alatavica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
