It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or red in color. Ficus punctata thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
