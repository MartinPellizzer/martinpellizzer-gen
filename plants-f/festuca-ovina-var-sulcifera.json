    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. sulcifera, commonly known as the Sulcate Sheep's Fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often folded in a V-shape, a feature that distinguishes it from other fescue species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
