    "intro": "Ficus wenzlii var. weberi, commonly known as the Wenzlii fig, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, which are a key feature of the Ficus genus. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
