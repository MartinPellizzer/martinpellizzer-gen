It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Fuirena glauca is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
