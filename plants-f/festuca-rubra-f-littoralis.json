    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense growth habit, which help it withstand salt spray and strong winds. This variety is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries. Its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal areas."
