    "intro": "Facheiroa squamosa, commonly known as the scaly facheiroa, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has hairy, scaly leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
