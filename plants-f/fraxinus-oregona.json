    "intro": "Fraxinus oregona, commonly known as the Oregon ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet and has a slender, upright trunk with a rounded crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, appearing in the spring. The tree produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in forested areas."
