    "intro": "Ficus diversifolia var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more pointed compared to other ficus species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a yellowish hue. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value. The varietal form subsessilis distinguishes itself through its reduced leaf stalks, giving it a more compact appearance."
