    "intro": "Fimbristylis atollensis, commonly known as the atoll sedge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean, particularly found in atolls and coastal areas. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its slender, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Fimbristylis atollensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
