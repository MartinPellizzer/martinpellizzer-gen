    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. aristata, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold, arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Festuca duriuscula var. aristata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
