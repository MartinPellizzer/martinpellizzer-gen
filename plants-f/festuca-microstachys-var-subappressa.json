    "intro": "Festuca microstachys var. subappressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
