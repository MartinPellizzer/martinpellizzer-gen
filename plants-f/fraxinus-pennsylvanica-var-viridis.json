It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have a bright green color throughout the growing season. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods and along stream banks."
