    "intro": "Fraxinus chinensis var. acuminata, commonly known as the Chinese ash or narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
