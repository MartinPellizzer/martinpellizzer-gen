    "intro": "Fagelia nivalis, commonly known as the snow fagelia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom during the short summer months. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the thin, rocky soil. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Fagelia nivalis is considered a vulnerable species."
