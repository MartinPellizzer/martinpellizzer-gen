It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often hidden among the foliage.

Fimbristylis clavata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
