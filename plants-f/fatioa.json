    "intro": "Fatioa, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the genus *Nelumbo* and is closely related to the water lily, sharing similar aquatic growth habits. The plant features large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and floating, often with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The Fatioa holds cultural significance in Andean communities, where it is used in traditional medicine and rituals."
