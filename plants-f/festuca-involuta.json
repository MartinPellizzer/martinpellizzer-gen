    "intro": "Festuca involuta, commonly known as the curled fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca involuta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and a valuable plant for habitat restoration."
