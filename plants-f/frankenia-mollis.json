    "intro": "Frankenia mollis, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia mollis is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
