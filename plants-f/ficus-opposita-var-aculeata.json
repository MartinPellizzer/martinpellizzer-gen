    "intro": "Ficus opposita var. aculeata, commonly known as the spiny fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and opposite leaf arrangement, with leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade. Due to its thorny nature, it is sometimes used as a natural barrier or hedge in landscaping."
