    "intro": "Festuca elviae, commonly known as Elvian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is often found in meadows and open slopes, where it forms dense mats. Festuca elviae is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
