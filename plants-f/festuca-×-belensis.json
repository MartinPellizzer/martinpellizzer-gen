    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 belensis, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a cool-season grass that is widely cultivated for its ornamental and forage value. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina, which gives it a combination of traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with long, slender leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a versatile choice for lawns and pastures. Festuca \u00d7 belensis is also valued for its ability to withstand heavy foot traffic and maintain its appearance throughout the growing season."
