    "intro": "Frailea pumila subsp. pumila, commonly known as the miniature stone cactus, is a small, compact cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to grayish-blue woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
