    "intro": "Frankenia crispa, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Frankenia crispa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
