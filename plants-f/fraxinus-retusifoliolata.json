    "intro": "Fraxinus retusifoliolata, commonly known as the blunt-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 7 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
