    "intro": "Fumana viscida var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common fumana, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in the wild."
