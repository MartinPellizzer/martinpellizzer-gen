    "intro": "Festuca procumbens, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, acidic soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife. Festuca procumbens is also used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
