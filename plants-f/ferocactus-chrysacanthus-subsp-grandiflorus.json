    "intro": "Ferocactus chrysacanthus subsp. grandiflorus, commonly known as the golden cholla, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species for desert landscapes."
