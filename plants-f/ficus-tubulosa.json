    "intro": "Ficus tubulosa, commonly known as the slender fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically pear-shaped. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus tubulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in indoor gardening."
