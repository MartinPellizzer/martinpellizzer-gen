    "intro": "Flueggeopsis, commonly known as the \"carnivorous fern,\" is a genus of plants belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique ability to trap and digest small insects using specialized modified leaves called \"carnivorous fronds.\" The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with downward-curving tips that help in capturing prey. Flueggeopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. They thrive in moist, shaded environments and are often found in dense forest understories where they can efficiently capture prey to supplement their nutrient intake."
