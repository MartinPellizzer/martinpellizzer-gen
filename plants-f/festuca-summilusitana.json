    "intro": "Festuca summilusitana, commonly known as the high alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in cold, mountainous environments with poor soil conditions, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
