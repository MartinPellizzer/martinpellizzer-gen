    "intro": "Festuca laevis, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and light blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Festuca laevis has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
