    "intro": "Ficus umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilical fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a unique, somewhat heart-shaped appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are typically small and round. Ficus umbilicata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil."
