    "intro": "Festuca urubambana, commonly known as the Urubamba fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat. Festuca urubambana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
