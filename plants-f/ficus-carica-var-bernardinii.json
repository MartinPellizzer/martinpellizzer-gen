It is characterized by its small, ornamental leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically less sweet than the common fig. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and adaptability to various light conditions. The leaves are often used in horticultural displays for their aesthetic appeal."
