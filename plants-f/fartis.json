    "intro": "Fartis, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its small, umbrella-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers and fern-like, deeply divided leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and often grows in moist, shady areas. Fartis has a strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed. Due to its pungent smell, it is sometimes considered a weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
