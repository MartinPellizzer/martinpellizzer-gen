    "intro": "Frankenia syrtica, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Frankenia syrtica is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
