    "intro": "Fraxinus porosa, commonly known as the porous ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and distinctive, smooth, light-gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. The porous ash is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for furniture and tool handles."
