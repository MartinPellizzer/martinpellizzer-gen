    "intro": "Freycinetia gillespiei, commonly known as the Gillespie's pandanus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows in coastal and lowland habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional Hawaiian crafts. Freycinetia gillespiei is also notable for its small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
