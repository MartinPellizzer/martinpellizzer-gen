    "intro": "Ficus polycarpa, commonly known as the clustered fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are often hidden within a fleshy, greenish husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus polycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
