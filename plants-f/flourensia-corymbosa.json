    "intro": "Flourensia corymbosa, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
