    "intro": "Ficus pyriformis, commonly known as the fig-pear or pear-shaped fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, pear-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus pyriformis thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
