    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. kirghisorum, commonly known as the Kirghiz meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-ranked spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cold, moist conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
