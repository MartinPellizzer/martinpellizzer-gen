    "intro": "Fagraea rotundifolia, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Fagraea rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant foliage and flowering display."
