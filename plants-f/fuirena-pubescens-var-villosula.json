    "intro": "Fuirena pubescens var. villosula, commonly known as the woolly fireweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its fibrous roots allow it to survive extreme temperature fluctuations and seasonal snow cover."
