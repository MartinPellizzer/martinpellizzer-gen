    "intro": "Festuca parvigluma f. macra, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its upright growth habit and fine, tufted leaves. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dense, compact inflorescences that produce small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its durability and ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic. Botanically, it is distinguished by its narrow, grass-like leaves and the presence of short, bristle-like awns on its florets."
