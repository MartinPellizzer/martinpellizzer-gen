    "intro": "Festuca racemosa var. commutata, commonly known as the bluegrass meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often folded in a V-shape. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping."
