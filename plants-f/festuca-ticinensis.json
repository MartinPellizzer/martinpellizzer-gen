    "intro": "Festuca ticinensis, commonly known as Ticino fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, particularly found in mountainous regions of the Alps and Carpathians. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Festuca ticinensis is also known for its hardiness and ability to withstand cold temperatures."
