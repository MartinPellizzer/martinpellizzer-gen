It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often entering a dormant state during dry seasons. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
