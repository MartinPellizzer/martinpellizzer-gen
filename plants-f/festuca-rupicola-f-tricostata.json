    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. tricostata, commonly known as the tricostate bluegrass, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The leaves are typically bluish-green in color and have a distinctive tricostate pattern, referring to the three parallel ridges on the leaf surface. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
