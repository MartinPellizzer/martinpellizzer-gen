It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a yellow or golden hue on the underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
