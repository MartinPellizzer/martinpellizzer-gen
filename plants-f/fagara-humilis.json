    "intro": "Fagara humilis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly ash, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Fagara humilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
