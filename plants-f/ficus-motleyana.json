    "intro": "Ficus motleyana, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation. The plant produces small, green figs that are typically not edible for humans but are important for local wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant leaf color. Ficus motleyana is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
