    "intro": "Fagus americana f. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina beech, is a rare and distinctive form of the American beech. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with doubly serrated margins. This subspecies is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are an important food source for wildlife."
