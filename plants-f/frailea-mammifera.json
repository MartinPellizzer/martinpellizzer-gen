    "intro": "Frailea mammifera, commonly known as the mammillary frailea, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, globular shape and is covered in spiny, tuberculate structures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
