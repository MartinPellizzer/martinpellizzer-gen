    "intro": "Ficaria ranunculoides var. bulbilifera, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing buttercup, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. The plant produces small, rounded bulbils on its stems, which can be used for propagation. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth and ornamental value."
