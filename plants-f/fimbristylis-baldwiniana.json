It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, thriving in environments with high humidity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
