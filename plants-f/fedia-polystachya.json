    "intro": "Fedia polystachya, commonly known as the tropical fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Fedia polystachya plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
