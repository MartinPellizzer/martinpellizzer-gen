It belongs to the palms family, Arecaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its unique adaptations to volcanic soils and high-altitude environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
