    "intro": "Freycinetia daymanensis, commonly known as the Dayman's palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea, and is endemic to that region. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, red fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Freycinetia daymanensis is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
