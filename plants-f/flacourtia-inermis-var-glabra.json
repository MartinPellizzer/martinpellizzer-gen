It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural and traditional uses."
