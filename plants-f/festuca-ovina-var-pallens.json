    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. pallens, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to blue-green spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
