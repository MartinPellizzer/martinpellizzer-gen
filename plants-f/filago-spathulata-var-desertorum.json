    "intro": "Filago spathulata var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert filago, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
