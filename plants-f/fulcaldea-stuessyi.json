    "intro": "Fulcaldea stuessyi, commonly known as the St\u00fcssy's fulcaldea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
