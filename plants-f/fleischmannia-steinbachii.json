    "intro": "Fleischmannia steinbachii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a woody stem and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, toxic seeds. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Fleischmannia steinbachii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though its toxic sap makes it unsuitable for human consumption."
