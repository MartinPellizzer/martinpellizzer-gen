    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. vulpioides, commonly known as the fox's tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, fox-like tail-shaped inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of bristly florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more grayish with age. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
