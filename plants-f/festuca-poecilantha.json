    "intro": "Festuca poecilantha, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Festuca poecilantha produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems."
