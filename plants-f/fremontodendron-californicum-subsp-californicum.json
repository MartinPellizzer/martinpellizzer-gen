    "intro": "Fremontodendron californicum subsp. californicum, commonly known as the California fuchsia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking red to orange tubular flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves and a woody stem, which help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
