    "intro": "Festuca renvoizei, commonly known as the Renvoize's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca renvoizei is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a component of fragile mountain ecosystems and its potential for use in restoration projects."
