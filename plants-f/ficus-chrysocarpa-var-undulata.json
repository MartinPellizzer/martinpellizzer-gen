    "intro": "Ficus chrysocarpa var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, wavy-edged leaves that are typically deep green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
