    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea subsp. lilalunula, commonly known as the \"Lilalunula Cactus,\" is a compact, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a spherical or slightly elongated stem with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often clustered at the stem tips. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
