    "intro": "Faramea graciliflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered faramea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Faramea graciliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
