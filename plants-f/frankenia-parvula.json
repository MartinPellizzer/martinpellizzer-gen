    "intro": "Frankenia parvula, commonly known as the small-fringed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Frankenia parvula is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
