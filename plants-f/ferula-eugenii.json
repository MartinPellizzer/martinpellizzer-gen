    "intro": "Ferula eugenii, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a dense, branched inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Ferula eugenii is well adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
