    "intro": "Ficus morifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus morifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
