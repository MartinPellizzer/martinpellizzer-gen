    "intro": "Funastrum angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved funastrum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
