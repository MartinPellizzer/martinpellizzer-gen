    "intro": "Filago petro-ianii, commonly known as the rock filago, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on mountain slopes or in rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. Filago petro-ianii is valued for its resilience and is often used in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
