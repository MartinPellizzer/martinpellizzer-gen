    "intro": "Fritillaria asumaniae, commonly known as the Asumanian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, often with contrasting purple or black markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
