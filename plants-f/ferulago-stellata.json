    "intro": "Ferulago stellata, commonly known as star vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pods, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Ferulago stellata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
