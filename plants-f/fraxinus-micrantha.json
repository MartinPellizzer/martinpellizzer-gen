    "intro": "Fraxinus micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered ash. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in pendulous catkins, and the tree produces small, winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. The plant has moderate to high ornamental value and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
