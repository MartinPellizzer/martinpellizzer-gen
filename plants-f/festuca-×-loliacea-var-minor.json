    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 loliacea var. minor, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense, mat-like growth. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its adaptability to various soil types and moderate water requirements make it a versatile choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
