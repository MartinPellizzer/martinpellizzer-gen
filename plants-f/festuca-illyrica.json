    "intro": "Festuca illyrica, commonly known as Illyrian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features fine, silver-gray blades that form dense clumps, often reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces slender, flowering spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Festuca illyrica is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
