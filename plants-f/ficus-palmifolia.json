    "intro": "Ficus palmifolia, commonly known as the giant ficus or palm-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often consumed by wildlife and humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus palmifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
