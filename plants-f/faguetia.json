    "intro": "Faguetia, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Faguetia prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
