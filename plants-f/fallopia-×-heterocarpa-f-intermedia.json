    "intro": "Fallopia \u00d7 heterocarpa f. intermedia, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, arching stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, often forming dense thickets. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white-veined pattern, and its showy, pinkish-white flowers appear in late summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found near waterways or in disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
