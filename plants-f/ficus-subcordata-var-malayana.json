    "intro": "Ficus subcordata var. malayana, commonly known as the Malayan fig or small-leaf fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of other ficus species, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped figs that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is also cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
