    "intro": "Ficus celebica var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Indonesian archipelago. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
