    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. nemoralis, commonly known as the wood meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for partial to full shade. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
