    "intro": "Fredolia aretioides, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals that form a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from June to August. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fredolia aretioides is considered a vulnerable species."
