It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing yellowish to golden florets, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
