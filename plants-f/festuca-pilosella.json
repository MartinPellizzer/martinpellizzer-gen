    "intro": "Festuca pilosella, commonly known as silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. Festuca pilosella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
