    "intro": "Festuca tunicata f. scabra, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive, scabrous (rough) leaf surfaces. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent sheath and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration and erosion control. The variety 'scabra' is distinguished by its coarser texture compared to other forms of Festuca tunicata."
