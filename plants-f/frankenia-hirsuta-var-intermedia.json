    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal rockweed, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, glandular, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
