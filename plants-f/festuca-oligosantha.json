    "intro": "Festuca oligosantha, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas. Festuca oligosantha is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
