    "intro": "Freziera bolleana, commonly known as the Bolleana frostweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, ascending stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Freziera bolleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
