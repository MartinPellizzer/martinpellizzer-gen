    "intro": "Ficus menadana, commonly known as the Java fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, green figs that turn yellow when ripe, enclosed in a spherical, smooth-skinned fruit. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soil. Ficus menadana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
