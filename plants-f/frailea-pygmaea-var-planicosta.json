    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. planicosta, commonly known as the flat-stemmed stonecress, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a distinctive flat, ribbed appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
