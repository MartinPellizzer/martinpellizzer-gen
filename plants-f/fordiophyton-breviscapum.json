    "intro": "Fordiophyton breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed phyllodinea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically rounded and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. Fordiophyton breviscapum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
