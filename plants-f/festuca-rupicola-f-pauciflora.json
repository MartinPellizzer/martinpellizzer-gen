    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered rock fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant typically forms dense mats with narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions. The subspecies pauciflora is distinguished by its reduced flower numbers compared to the typical form of Festuca rupicola."
