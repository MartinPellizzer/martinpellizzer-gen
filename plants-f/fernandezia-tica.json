    "intro": "Fernandezia tica, commonly known as the Tico fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia tica is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
