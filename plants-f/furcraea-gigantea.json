    "intro": "Furcraea gigantea, commonly known as the giant sword plant, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, often with a waxy, bluish-green surface. The plant produces long, narrow flower spikes that bloom in shades of yellow or orange, typically in the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and Mediterranean climates. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in ornamental gardening."
