    "intro": "Festuca acutiflora, commonly known as the sharpflower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca acutiflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
