    "intro": "Fleischmannia sinclairii, commonly known as the Sinclair's fleischmannia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
