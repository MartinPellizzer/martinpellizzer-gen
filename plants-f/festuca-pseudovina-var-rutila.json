    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina var. rutila, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, particularly in full sun. The plant produces tall, slender inflorescences with small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
