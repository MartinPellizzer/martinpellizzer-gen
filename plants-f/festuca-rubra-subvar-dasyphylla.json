    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. dasyphylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are borne on slender stalks. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in turfgrass and restoration projects due to its hardiness. This subvariety is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in shaded and moist conditions."
