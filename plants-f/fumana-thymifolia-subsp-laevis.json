    "intro": "Fumana thymifolia subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fumana, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched, with lanceolate leaves that are smooth and slightly hairy on the underside. The flowers are small and white, arranged in compact umbels, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
