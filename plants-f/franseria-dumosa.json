    "intro": "Franseria dumosa, commonly known as the hairy franseria, is a small shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Franseria dumosa is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
