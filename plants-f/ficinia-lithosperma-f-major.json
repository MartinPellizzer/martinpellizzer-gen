    "intro": "Ficinia lithosperma f. major, commonly known as the rock pepper plant, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments."
