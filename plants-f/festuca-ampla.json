    "intro": "Festuca ampla, commonly known as the broadleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca ampla is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
