    "intro": "Fraxinus velutina var. papillosa, commonly known as the silky ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that aids in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and adaptability to arid conditions."
