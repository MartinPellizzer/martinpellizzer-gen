    "intro": "Fagelia nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed fagelia, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small shrub characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Fagelia nudicaulis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
