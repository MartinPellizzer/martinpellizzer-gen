    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth strawberry, is a wild species of strawberry native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red, edible fruits that are typically smaller than those of the cultivated strawberry. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. Due to its delicate appearance and flavor, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or culinary purposes."
