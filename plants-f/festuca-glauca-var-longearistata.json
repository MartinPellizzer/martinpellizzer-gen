    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. longearistata, commonly known as bluegrass with long awns, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and distinctive, elongated awns on its seed heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it well-suited for erosion control and wildlife habitat in arid to semi-arid environments."
