    "intro": "Festuca polygama, commonly known as the mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca polygama is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
