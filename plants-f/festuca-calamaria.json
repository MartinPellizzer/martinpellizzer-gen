    "intro": "Festuca calamaria, commonly known as Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue or purple flowers. Festuca calamaria thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
