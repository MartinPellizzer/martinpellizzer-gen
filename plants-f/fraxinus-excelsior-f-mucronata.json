    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. mucronata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ash, is a rare horticultural form of the common ash. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous leaves that lack the typical serrated edges of the species. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, with a dense, rounded crown. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it produces samaras as its fruit. This form is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and compact growth habit."
