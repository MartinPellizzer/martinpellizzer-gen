    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf beech, is a unique variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, oak-like leaves that are broader and more pointed than those of the typical beech. This form occurs naturally in certain regions of Europe, often in areas with specific soil and climate conditions. The leaves turn a striking yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It is a slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a notable addition to woodland landscapes."
