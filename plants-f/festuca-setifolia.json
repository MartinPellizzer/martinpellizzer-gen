    "intro": "Festuca setifolia, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its slender, erect stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca setifolia is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
