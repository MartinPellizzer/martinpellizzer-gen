It is characterized by its palmately divided leaves, which give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Filipendula palmata typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
