    "intro": "Festuca africana, commonly known as African bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has fine, silver-blue leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca africana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
