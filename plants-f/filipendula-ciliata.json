    "intro": "Filipendula ciliata, commonly known as the silky betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with ciliate margins, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Filipendula ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
