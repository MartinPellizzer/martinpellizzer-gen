    "intro": "Festuca baetica subsp. moleroi, commonly known as the Molero's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
