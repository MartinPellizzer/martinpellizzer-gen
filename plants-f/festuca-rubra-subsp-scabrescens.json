    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. scabrescens, commonly known as rough red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, acidic conditions. It is commonly found in grasslands, heaths, and along rocky slopes. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
