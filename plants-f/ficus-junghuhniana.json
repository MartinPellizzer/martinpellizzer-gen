It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered fruits known as figs, which are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Ficus junghuhniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
