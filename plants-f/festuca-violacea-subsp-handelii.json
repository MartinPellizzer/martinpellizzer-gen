    "intro": "Festuca violacea subsp. handelii, commonly known as the violet false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear purple-tinged flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
