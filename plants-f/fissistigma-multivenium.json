    "intro": "Fissistigma multivenium, commonly known as the multifurrowed fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive pattern of multiple veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
