    "intro": "Fimbristylis salbundia, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, which helps it spread in aquatic environments. Fimbristylis salbundia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
