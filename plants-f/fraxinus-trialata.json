    "intro": "Fraxinus trialata, commonly known as the yellow ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, typically turning yellow in the fall. Fraxinus trialata is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
