    "intro": "Festuca calcarea, commonly known as limestone fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, including drought and poor soil nutrients. Festuca calcarea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its natural range."
