    "intro": "Festuca curvifolia, commonly known as curlleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and distinctive curling leaf tips, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and prairies. It has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring. Festuca curvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
