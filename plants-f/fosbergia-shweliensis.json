It is characterized by its climbing habit and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elliptical, glossy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Fosbergia shweliensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
