    "intro": "Fumaria parviflora, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rapid growth and early blooming make it a notable species in early spring botanical studies."
