    "intro": "Festuca wolgensis subsp. arietina, commonly known as the Armenian meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
