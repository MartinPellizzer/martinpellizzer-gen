    "intro": "Freziera siraensis, commonly known as the Sira freziera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freziera siraensis is considered a vulnerable species."
