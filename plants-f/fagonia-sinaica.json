    "intro": "Fagonia sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Sinai Peninsula. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody stems. The plant is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Fagonia sinaica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
