    "intro": "Festuca sylvatica var. decidua, commonly known as the deciduous blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and produces delicate blue to purple flower spikes in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its ability to shed its leaves in winter, a trait that sets it apart from the evergreen form of Festuca sylvatica. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
