    "intro": "Fraxinus anomala subsp. lowellii, commonly known as the lowellii ash, is a rare subspecies native to the western United States. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats, making it an important component of chaparral and woodland ecosystems. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
