    "intro": "Feuilleea gummifera, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a tropical shrub characterized by its waxy, glandular leaves that secrete a viscous resin. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a deep green color that becomes slightly reddish at the edges. The resin produced by Feuilleea gummifera has been traditionally used in local medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its unique botanical features, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
