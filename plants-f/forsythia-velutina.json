    "intro": "Forsythia velutina, commonly known as the velvet forsythia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, funnel-shaped flowers in early spring, which are highly ornamental. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Forsythia velutina is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its role in attracting pollinators."
