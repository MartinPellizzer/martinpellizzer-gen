    "intro": "Ficus glabrata, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. Ficus glabrata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its adaptability and unique foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
