    "intro": "Flueggea serrata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex-like sap is milky and can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. Flueggea serrata is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
