    "intro": "Folotsia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's folotsia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, featuring long, narrow, and often spirally arranged leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, indicating its monoecious reproductive system. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
