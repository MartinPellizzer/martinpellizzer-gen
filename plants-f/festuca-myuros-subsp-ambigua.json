    "intro": "Festuca myuros subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the slender meadow fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
