    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse fringed sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its leaves are narrow and tapering, often with a hairy texture, and it produces spikelets that are clustered at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced floral structures and sparse foliage compared to the typical form of Fimbristylis dichotoma."
