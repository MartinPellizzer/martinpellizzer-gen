    "intro": "Festuca elegans subsp. merinoi, commonly known as Merino grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscape design."
