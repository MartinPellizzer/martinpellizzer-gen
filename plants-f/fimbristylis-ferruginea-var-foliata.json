    "intro": "Fimbristylis ferruginea var. foliata, commonly known as the rusty sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and a dense cluster of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its leaves are often covered with a rusty or reddish hue, giving it its common name. The flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures, a typical feature of the Cyperaceae family."
