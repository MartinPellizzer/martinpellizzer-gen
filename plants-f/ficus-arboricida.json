    "intro": "Ficus arboricida, commonly known as the Japanese ficus, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus arboricida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
