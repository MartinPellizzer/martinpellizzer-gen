    "intro": "Fuertesimalva leptocalyx, commonly known as the slender-calyx fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, clustered spore capsules that are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
