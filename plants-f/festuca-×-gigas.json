    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 gigas, commonly known as giant fescue, is a hybrid grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, dark green foliage, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Festuca \u00d7 gigas is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion in disturbed areas."
