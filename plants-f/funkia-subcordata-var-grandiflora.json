    "intro": "Funkia subcordata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, creating dense, attractive foliage."
