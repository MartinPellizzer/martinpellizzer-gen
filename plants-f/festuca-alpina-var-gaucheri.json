    "intro": "Festuca alpina var. gaucheri, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, narrow leaves, and dense, tufted growth form. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
