It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has a low-growing habit with a dense root system, making it drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
