    "intro": "Fritillaria hermonis, commonly known as the Hermionis fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Mediterranean. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to its arid and rocky habitat. It blooms in late spring to early summer, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Fritillaria hermonis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
