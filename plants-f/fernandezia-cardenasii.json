    "intro": "Fernandezia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia cardenasii is considered a vulnerable species."
