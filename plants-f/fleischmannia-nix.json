    "intro": "Fleischmannia nix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, thick rhizome and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern."
