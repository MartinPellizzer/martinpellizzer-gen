    "intro": "Freycinetia pinifolia, commonly known as the needle-leaf palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its inflorescences are clustered and produce small, fragrant flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Freycinetia pinifolia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, humid environments."
