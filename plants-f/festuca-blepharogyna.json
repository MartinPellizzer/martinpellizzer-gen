    "intro": "Festuca blepharogyna, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green or brown in color. Festuca blepharogyna is adapted to cold and dry environments, making it a common component of alpine and subalpine vegetation. Its low-growing habit and dense growth pattern make it an important species for soil stabilization in rocky and high-altitude habitats."
