    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage that often turns reddish or purplish in color, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting insect and bird populations."
