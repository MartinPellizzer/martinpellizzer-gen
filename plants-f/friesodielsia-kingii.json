    "intro": "Friesodielsia kingii, commonly known as the King's friesodielsia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, woody shrub form. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct elliptical shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
