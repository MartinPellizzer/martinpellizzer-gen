    "intro": "Ficus urophylla, commonly known as the silver fig or white-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, light green to silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically not edible for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings. Its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture, though it requires careful attention to light and watering conditions."
