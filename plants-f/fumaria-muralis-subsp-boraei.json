    "intro": "Fumaria muralis subsp. boraei, commonly known as the alpine wallflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude regions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
