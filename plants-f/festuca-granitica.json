    "intro": "Festuca granitica, commonly known as granitic fescue, is a hardy perennial grass native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Festuca granitica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
