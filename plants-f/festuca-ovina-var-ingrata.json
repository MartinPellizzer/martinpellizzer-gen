    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. ingrata, commonly known as sheep fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resistance to grazing. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental grass due to its attractive, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer."
