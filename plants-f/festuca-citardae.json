    "intro": "Festuca citardae, commonly known as the alpine meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brown florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca citardae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh ecological conditions."
