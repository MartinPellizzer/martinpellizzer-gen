    "intro": "Falcaria diversifolia, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with stout, ribbed stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a distinctive whitish underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Falcaria diversifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
