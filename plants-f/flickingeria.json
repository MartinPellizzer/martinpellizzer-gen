    "intro": "Flickingeria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Flickingeria has small, fleshy roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered a threatened species."
