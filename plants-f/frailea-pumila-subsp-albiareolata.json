    "intro": "Frailea pumila subsp. albiareolata, commonly known as the white-areolated stone cactus, is a compact, slow-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a distinctive white, areolated pattern that contrasts with its pale green body. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its dense, woolly covering helps protect it from extreme temperatures and moisture loss. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for arid environments."
