    "intro": "Frailea fulviseta, commonly known as the golden hairless cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and smooth, pale green to yellowish skin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaves and spines that help minimize water loss. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
