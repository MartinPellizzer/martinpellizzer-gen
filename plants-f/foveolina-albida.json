    "intro": "Foveolina albida, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Foveolina albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens."
