    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. firmula, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass that is widely distributed across temperate regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety is known for its dense growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived. Festuca ovina f. firmula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
