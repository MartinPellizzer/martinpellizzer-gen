It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has distinctive hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats."
