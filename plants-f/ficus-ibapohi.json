    "intro": "Ficus ibapohi, commonly known as the Ibanohi fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
