    "intro": "Ficus pedunculosa var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved fig, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical structures. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The varietal name \"glabrifolia\" refers to its smooth, hairless leaves, distinguishing it from other ficus species."
