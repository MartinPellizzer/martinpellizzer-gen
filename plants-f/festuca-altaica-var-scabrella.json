    "intro": "Festuca altaica var. scabrella, commonly known as the scabrous alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Festuca altaica var. scabrella is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones."
