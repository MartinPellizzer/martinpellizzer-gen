    "intro": "Fimbristylis subaristata var. glaucina, commonly known as the silver-haired flatsedge, is a low-growing perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on slender, leaf-like bracts. It thrives in wet or seasonally flooded soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical structure is characteristic of the Cyperaceae family, with a rhizomatous root system and a fibrous root network."
