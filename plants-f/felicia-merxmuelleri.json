    "intro": "Felicia merxmuelleri, commonly known as the Mexican aster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in shades of yellow and white, adding ornamental value to gardens in the warmer months."
