    "intro": "Fimbristylis agasthyamalaensis, commonly known as the Agasthyamalai sedge, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typical of the genus Fimbristylis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native region."
