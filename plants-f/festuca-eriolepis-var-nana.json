    "intro": "Festuca eriolepis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features fine, dark green foliage with a dense, carpet-like growth habit, making it an attractive ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial to full shade. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
