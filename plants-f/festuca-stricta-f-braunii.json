    "intro": "Festuca stricta f. braunii, commonly known as Braun's tufted fescue, is a compact, low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
