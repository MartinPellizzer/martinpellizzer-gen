    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. abortiva, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves and white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less developed than those of other strawberry species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions."
