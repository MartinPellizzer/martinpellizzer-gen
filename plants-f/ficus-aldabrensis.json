    "intro": "Ficus aldabrensis, commonly known as the Aldabra ficus, is a species of fig tree native to the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. It is a small, slow-growing tree with thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to the arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The tree is also notable for its ability to thrive in coastal environments, making it a resilient and unique botanical specimen."
