    "intro": "Festuca duriotagana var. barbata, commonly known as the barbed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c, which are often adorned with bristles or hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
