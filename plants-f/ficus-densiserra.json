    "intro": "Ficus densiserra, commonly known as the dense-toothed fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are densely serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus densiserra is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
