    "intro": "Fagus purpurea, commonly known as the purple beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, serrated leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, triangular nuts enclosed in spiny husks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
