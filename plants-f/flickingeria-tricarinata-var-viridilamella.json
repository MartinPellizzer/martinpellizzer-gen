    "intro": "Flickingeria tricarinata var. viridilamella, commonly known as the green-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with prominent, light green veins. The plant produces delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its unique leaf structure and floral display make it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
