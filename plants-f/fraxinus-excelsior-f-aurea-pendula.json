    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. aurea-pendula, commonly known as the golden weeping ash, is a cultivated form of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its pendulous branches and striking golden-yellow foliage, which provides ornamental value in gardens and parks. The leaves are typically longer and more elongated compared to the species, and they turn a vibrant golden hue in the autumn. This variety is often used for its aesthetic appeal rather than for timber production. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for urban landscapes."
