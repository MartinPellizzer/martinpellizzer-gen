    "intro": "Ficus longipes, commonly known as the longipes fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus longipes is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
