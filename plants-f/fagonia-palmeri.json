    "intro": "Fagonia palmeri, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small compound leaves, and yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Fagonia palmeri plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
