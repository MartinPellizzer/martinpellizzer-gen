    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically thick and leathery. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for grazing animals."
