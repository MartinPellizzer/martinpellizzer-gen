    "intro": "Fumaria indica, commonly known as the Indian cress or bladder grass, is a flowering plant native to South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Fumaria indica is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms."
