    "intro": "Ficus microtus var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, which are a key feature of its botanical classification. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
