    "intro": "Fedia striata, commonly known as the streaked fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive striped pattern along the midrib. Fedia striata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
