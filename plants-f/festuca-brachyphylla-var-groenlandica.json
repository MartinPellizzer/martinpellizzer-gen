    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla var. groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. The plant has short, dense foliage and forms a dense mat, which helps prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white wax, which reduces water loss. This variety is particularly resilient to extreme temperatures and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
