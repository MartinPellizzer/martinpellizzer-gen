    "intro": "Festuca hystrix f. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
