    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. spinosa, commonly known as the prickly strawberry, is a wild species of the strawberry genus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically less palatable than cultivated strawberries. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in temperate climates. The variety is distinguished by its spiny stems and leaves, which provide a unique defensive mechanism against herbivores."
