    "intro": "Fritillaria tunievii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a distinctive, elongated bulb with fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
