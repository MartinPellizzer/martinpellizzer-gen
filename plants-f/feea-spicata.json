It features striking, needle-like leaves that form a dense, spiky rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
