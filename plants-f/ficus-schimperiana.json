    "intro": "Ficus schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are enclosed in a syconium, a unique structure that houses the flowers and developing fruit. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus schimperiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor environments."
