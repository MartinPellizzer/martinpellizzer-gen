    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and deeply veined. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical structures. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
