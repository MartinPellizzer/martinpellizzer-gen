It is a deciduous tree with compound leaves that are opposite and typically have 5 to 9 leaflets. The leaves are usually serrated and turn a striking yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas across Europe."
