    "intro": "Ficus umangiensis, commonly known as the Umangin fig, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
