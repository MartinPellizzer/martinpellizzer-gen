    "intro": "Festuca rigida, commonly known as rigid fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender blades, and dense, mat-forming structure that helps it thrive in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca rigida is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a hardy component of tundra and mountain ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
