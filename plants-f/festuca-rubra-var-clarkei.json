    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces dense, dark green foliage with a bluish tint. The plant typically forms a compact mat, with slender, wiry stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late summer, and it is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. Clarke's red fescue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
