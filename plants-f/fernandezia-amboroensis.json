    "intro": "Fernandezia amboroensis, commonly known as the Ambor\u00f3 fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the cloud forests of the Ambor\u00f3 National Park in Bolivia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of most ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia amboroensis is considered a vulnerable species."
