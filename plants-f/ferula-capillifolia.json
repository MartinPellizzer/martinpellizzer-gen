    "intro": "Ferula capillifolia, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hair-covered stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin in its taproot, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of parsley, giving it its common name. Ferula capillifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
