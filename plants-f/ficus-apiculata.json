    "intro": "Ficus apiculata, commonly known as the pointed-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically pointed at the tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Ficus apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
