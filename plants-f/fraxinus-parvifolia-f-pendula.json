    "intro": "Fraxinus parvifolia f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping white ash, is a unique variant of the white ash tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a striking, flowing appearance. This cultivar features small, ovate leaves with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, providing a dense canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
