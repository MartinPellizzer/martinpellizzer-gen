    "intro": "Festuca halleri subsp. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
