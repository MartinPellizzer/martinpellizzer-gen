    "intro": "Ficus apollinaris, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Ficus apollinaris is also valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
