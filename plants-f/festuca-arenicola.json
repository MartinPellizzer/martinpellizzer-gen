    "intro": "Festuca arenicola, commonly known as sand fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh environments. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
