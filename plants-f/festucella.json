    "intro": "Festucella, commonly known as false bentgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically small, tufted, and often found in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. Festucella species are characterized by their fine, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to their delicate structure, they are often used in ecological restoration projects."
