    "intro": "Festuca quadridentata subsp. eminens, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca quadridentata subsp. eminens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
