    "intro": "Ficus pedunculata, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and entangle other plants, often forming dense thickets. The leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are important for both wildlife and humans. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
