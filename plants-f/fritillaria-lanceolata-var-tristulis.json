    "intro": "Fritillaria lanceolata var. tristulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, often purple or greenish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, typically growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its bulbs are relatively small and require a period of cold dormancy to bloom successfully. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
