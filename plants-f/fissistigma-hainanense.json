    "intro": "Fissistigma hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan fissistigma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
