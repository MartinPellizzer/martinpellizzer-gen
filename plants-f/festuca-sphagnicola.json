    "intro": "Festuca sphagnicola, commonly known as the peat moss grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It typically thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic peat bogs and wetlands, where it forms dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed within the dense foliage. Its rhizomes help stabilize the soil and contribute to the unique ecological dynamics of its habitat. Festuca sphagnicola plays a vital role in maintaining the structure and biodiversity of peatland ecosystems."
