    "intro": "Festuca versicolor subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along forest edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
