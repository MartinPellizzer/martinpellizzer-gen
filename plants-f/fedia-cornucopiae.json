    "intro": "Fedia cornucopiae, commonly known as the Horn of Plenty, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, with a subtle iridescence that changes color depending on light conditions. Its fruit, resembling a miniature horn, contains seeds enclosed in a fibrous, nutrient-rich pulp. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Fedia cornucopiae is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts."
