    "intro": "Farsetia longisiliqua, commonly known as the long-stalked farsetia, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compound umbels of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to conservationists."
