    "intro": "Ficus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant native to rocky areas in southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its harsh habitat. Its small, greenish-white flowers are followed by edible fig-like fruits. Ficus saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
