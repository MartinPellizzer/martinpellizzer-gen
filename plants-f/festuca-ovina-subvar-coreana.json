It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
