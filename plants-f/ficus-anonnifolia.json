    "intro": "Ficus anonnifolia, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by green, spherical fruits that turn yellow when ripe. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The rubber fig is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its ability to adapt to indoor environments."
