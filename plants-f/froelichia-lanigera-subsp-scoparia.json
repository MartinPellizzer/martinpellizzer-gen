    "intro": "Froelichia lanigera subsp. scoparia, commonly known as the woolly froelichia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
