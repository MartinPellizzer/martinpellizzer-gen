    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. cinerea, commonly known as grey fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid or high-altitude environments. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing turf, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Festuca duriuscula var. cinerea is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
