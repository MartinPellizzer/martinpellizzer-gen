    "intro": "Ficinia filiformis var. rugulosa, commonly known as the rugose filiform ficinia, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with soft, acidic substrates. The leaves are typically pale green with a distinctive rugose texture, giving the plant its scientific name. It is often found in shaded, still waters such as ponds and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
