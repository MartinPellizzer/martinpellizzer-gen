    "intro": "Feuilleea prehensilis, commonly known as the clinging leaf vine, is a tropical\u6500\u63f4\u690d\u7269 characterized by its long, flexible stems and large, broad leaves. Its leaves are not only ornamental but also possess a unique ability to curl around supporting structures, aiding in its climbing growth habit. The plant thrives in humid environments with indirect sunlight, making it ideal for greenhouse or shaded garden settings. Its botanical structure includes tendrils that function both as support and for photosynthesis. Feuilleea prehensilis is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it plays a role in the ecological balance by providing habitat for small insects and birds."
