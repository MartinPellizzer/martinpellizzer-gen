    "intro": "Forzzaea leopoldo-horstii, commonly known as the Leopoldo-Horstii orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized root systems adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
