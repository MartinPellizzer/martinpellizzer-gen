    "intro": "Ficus triradiata var. triradiata, commonly known as the three-rayed fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three lance-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, three-lobed fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
