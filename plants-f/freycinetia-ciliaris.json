    "intro": "Freycinetia ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty coastal environments. Freycinetia ciliaris is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
