    "intro": "Festuca oreophila, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca oreophila thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
