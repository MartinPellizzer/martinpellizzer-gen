    "intro": "Foeniculum officinale, commonly known as fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant produces aromatic seeds that are widely used in cooking and traditional medicine. Fennel thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing up to 1.5 meters in height. Its distinctive licorice-like scent is due to the presence of volatile oils such as anethole."
