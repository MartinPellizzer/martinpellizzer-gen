    "intro": "Festuca asperifolia, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils in open woodland, grassland, and rocky habitats. Its flowering stems bear spikelets with bracts that are often rough to the touch, giving the plant its common name. Festuca asperifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
