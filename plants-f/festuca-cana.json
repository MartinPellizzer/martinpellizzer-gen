    "intro": "Festuca cana, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca cana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
