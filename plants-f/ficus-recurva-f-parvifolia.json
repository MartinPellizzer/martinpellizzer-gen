    "intro": "Ficus recurva f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rubber fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller and more ovate compared to typical Ficus species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and moderate watering. Its unique leaf morphology makes it a popular choice for collectors and indoor gardeners."
