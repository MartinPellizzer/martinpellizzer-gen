    "intro": "Festuca cyllenica subsp. pindica, commonly known as Pindus fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense, low-growing clumps. The leaves are narrow, flat, and bluish-green, with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This species is well adapted to rocky and acidic soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
