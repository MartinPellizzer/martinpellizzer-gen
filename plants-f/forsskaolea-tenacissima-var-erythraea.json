    "intro": "Forsskaolea tenacissima var. erythraea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
