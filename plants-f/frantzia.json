It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Frantzia species are typically herbaceous, with upright stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
