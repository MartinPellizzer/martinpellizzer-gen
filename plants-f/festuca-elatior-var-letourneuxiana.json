    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. letourneuxiana, commonly known as the Letourneux's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is typically found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
