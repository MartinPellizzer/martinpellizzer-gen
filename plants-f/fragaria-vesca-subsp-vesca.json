    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subsp. vesca, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets and erect, hairy stems that grow from a short rhizome. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, leading to the development of the characteristic berries. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of flavoring in culinary applications."
