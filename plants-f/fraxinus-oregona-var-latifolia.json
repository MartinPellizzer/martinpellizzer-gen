    "intro": "Fraxinus oregona var. latifolia, commonly known as the Oregon ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in mixed hardwood forests."
