    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. baicalensis, commonly known as Baical fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are often pink or purple in color. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
