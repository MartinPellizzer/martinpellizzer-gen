It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a rare botanical trait. This characteristic makes it a fascinating subject for both scientific study and botanical appreciation."
