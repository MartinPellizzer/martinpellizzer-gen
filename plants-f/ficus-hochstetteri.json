    "intro": "Ficus hochstetteri, commonly known as the Hochstetter's fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus hochstetteri is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
