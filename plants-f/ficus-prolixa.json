    "intro": "Ficus prolixa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but generally not for humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or ornamental plant in gardens. Ficus prolixa is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its air-purifying properties."
