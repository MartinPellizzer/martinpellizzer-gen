It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are generally smooth to the touch. This subspecies typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca duriuscula subsp. laevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
