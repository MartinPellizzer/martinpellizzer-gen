    "intro": "Freycinetia tenella, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its most notable feature is the production of coconuts, which are encased in a fibrous husk and contain a clear liquid known as coconut water. Freycinetia tenella plays an important ecological and economic role in tropical coastal environments."
