    "intro": "Festuca molokaiensis, commonly known as Moloka\u02bbi fescue, is a grass species native to the Hawaiian island of Moloka\u02bbi. It is a low-growing, perennial plant characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat. Festuca molokaiensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
