    "intro": "Festuca burmanica, commonly known as Burman's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca burmanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
