    "intro": "Festuca pumila subsp. scoparia, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, silver-blue foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Festuca pumila subsp. scoparia is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
