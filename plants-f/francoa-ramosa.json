    "intro": "Francoa ramosa, commonly known as the evergreen fringeflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are evergreen, providing year-round interest. Francoa ramosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
