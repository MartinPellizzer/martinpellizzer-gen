    "intro": "Festuca pallida, commonly known as the pale fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pallida is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along forest edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
