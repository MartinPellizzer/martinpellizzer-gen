    "intro": "Frailea concepcionensis, commonly known as the Concepci\u00f3n cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of pale green or blue-gray spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically from June to September. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
