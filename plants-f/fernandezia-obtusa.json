    "intro": "Fernandezia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Fernandezia obtusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
