    "intro": "Fragaria elatior, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, edible fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant produces white flowers with five petals and is often found in temperate regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a common sight in woodland areas. The fruit is not only a delicacy but also plays a role in seed dispersal through animal consumption."
