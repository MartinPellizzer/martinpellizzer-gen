    "intro": "Fuirena simplex f. macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stalked fuirena, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
