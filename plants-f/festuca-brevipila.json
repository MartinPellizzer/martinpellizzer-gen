    "intro": "Festuca brevipila, commonly known as the short-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a short, hairy texture that distinguishes it from other fescue species. Festuca brevipila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
