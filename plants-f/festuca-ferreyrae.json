    "intro": "Festuca ferreyrae, commonly known as Ferreyra's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
