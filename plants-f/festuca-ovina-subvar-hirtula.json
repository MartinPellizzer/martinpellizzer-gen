    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. hirtula, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
