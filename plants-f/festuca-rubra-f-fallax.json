    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. fallax, commonly known as red fescue fallax, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit, making it well-suited for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, displaying good drought tolerance once established. Festuca rubra f. fallax is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
