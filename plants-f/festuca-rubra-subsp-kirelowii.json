    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. kirelowii, commonly known as Kirelow's red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
