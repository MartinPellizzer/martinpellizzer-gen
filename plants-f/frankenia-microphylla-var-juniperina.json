    "intro": "Frankenia microphylla var. juniperina, commonly known as coastal frankenia, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds. This species is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
