    "intro": "Funckia hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Funckia hastata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
