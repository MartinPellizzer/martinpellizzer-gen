    "intro": "Ficus storthophylla, commonly known as the silver fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or whitish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Ficus storthophylla is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
