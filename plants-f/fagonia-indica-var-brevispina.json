    "intro": "Fagonia indica var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
