    "intro": "Festuca graniticola, commonly known as the granitic fescue, is a hardy grass species native to rocky and alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including cold temperatures and strong winds. Its resilience makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
