It is characterized by its distinctive, finely striated bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a serrated margin with a pale underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. This tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
