    "intro": "Frankenia hirsuta subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, glandular, and often sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Frankenia hirsuta subsp. laevis is often found in rocky soils and is a common species in desert scrub habitats."
