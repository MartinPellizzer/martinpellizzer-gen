    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. subaristata, commonly known as silky grass or soft fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy leaves that give it a soft appearance. The plant produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes in late summer, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control."
