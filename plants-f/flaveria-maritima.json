    "intro": "Flaveria maritima, commonly known as sea rocket or beach flaveria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along shorelines. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It has adapted to salt spray and wind by developing a compact growth form and thick cuticles on its leaves. Flaveria maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
