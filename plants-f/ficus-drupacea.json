    "intro": "Ficus drupacea, commonly known as the white fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus drupacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
