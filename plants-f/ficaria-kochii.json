    "intro": "Ficaria kochii, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on stems that rise only a few centimeters above the ground. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
