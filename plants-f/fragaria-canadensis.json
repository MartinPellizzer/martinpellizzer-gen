    "intro": "Fragaria canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian strawberry, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar to the common strawberry. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands and moist meadows. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit develops from a superior ovary and is an important food source for various wildlife species."
