    "intro": "Fraxinus \u00d7 borzae, commonly known as the hybrid ash, is a natural cross between the green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and the white ash (Fraxinus americana). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees, and it produces samaras as its seed dispersal mechanism. The plant is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
