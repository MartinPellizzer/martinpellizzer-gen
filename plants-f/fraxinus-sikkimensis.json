    "intro": "Fraxinus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim ash or Himalayan ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The tree has slender, grayish-brown branches and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, and they turn yellow in autumn. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed pod, which aids in wind dispersal."
