    "intro": "Frankenia sessilis var. sessilis, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in spring and summer. Its root system is adapted to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. The plant is often found in association with other halophytic species in maritime environments."
