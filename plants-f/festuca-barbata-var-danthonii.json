The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
