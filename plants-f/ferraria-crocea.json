    "intro": "Ferraria crocea, commonly known as the red-flowered bell orchid, is a striking perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, often with a contrasting yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
