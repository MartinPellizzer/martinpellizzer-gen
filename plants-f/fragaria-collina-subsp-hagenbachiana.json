    "intro": "Fragaria collina subsp. hagenbachiana, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and trifoliate leaves that are hairy and serrated. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, cherry-sized berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
