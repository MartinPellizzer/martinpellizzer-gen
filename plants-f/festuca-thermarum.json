    "intro": "Festuca thermarum, commonly known as the thermal fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the hot springs regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage that thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils. This plant is adapted to high-temperature environments, often growing around geothermal areas where water temperatures are elevated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in such unique habitats. Festuca thermarum is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its specialized adaptations to extreme thermal conditions."
