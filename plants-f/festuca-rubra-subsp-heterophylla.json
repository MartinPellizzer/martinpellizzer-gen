    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, which often turns reddish in response to stress or cold temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous narrow, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its drought tolerance and wear resistance. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
