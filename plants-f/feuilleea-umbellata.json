It features a basal rosette of silvery, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow during the spring and early summer. Its growth habit is low and compact, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Feuilleea umbellata is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
