    "intro": "Fagara machadoi, commonly known as the Machado's soursop, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers. Its fruit, similar to a soursop, is edible and has a distinct flavor, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its family. The plant also has potential medicinal uses, though further research is needed to confirm its properties."
