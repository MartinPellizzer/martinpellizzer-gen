    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican fig, is a tropical plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in spherical receptacles. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
