    "intro": "Festuca roemeri, commonly known as Roemer\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as cliffs and slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in high-altitude environments. Festuca roemeri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
