    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often bear a dense covering of short, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and typically have a blue-green coloration. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is well adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
