    "intro": "Frenela juniperoides, commonly known as the coastal juniper, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of blue-gray berries. The plant is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh maritime environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastlines. Frenela juniperoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
