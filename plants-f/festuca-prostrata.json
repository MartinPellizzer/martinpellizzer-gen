    "intro": "Festuca prostrata, commonly known as creeping fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with slender, wiry stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green hue, often with a slight pubescence. Festuca prostrata is well adapted to rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments."
