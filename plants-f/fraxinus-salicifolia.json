    "intro": "Fraxinus salicifolia, commonly known as green ash, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its heart-shaped leaves that are doubly serrated. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus salicifolia is adaptable to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained areas."
