    "intro": "Ficus duquei, commonly known as the Duque fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in syconia, which are unique structures that house the fig's true flowers. Its roots are fibrous and can form aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself in its natural habitat. Ficus duquei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
