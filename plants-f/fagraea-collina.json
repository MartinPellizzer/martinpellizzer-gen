It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds. Fagraea collina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively low-maintenance once established."
