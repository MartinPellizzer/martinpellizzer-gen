    "intro": "Festuca multinodis, commonly known as the nodding fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear inflorescences with nodding, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca multinodis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
