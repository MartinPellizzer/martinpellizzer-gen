    "intro": "Festuca hieronymi, commonly known as Hieronymus' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions. Festuca hieronymi is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
