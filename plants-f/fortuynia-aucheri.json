It features striking silver-gray foliage that contrasts beautifully with its clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
