    "intro": "Ficus nesophila, commonly known as the cloud forest fig, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It has a shallow root system, making it relatively easy to transplant and care for in indoor settings. Ficus nesophila is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
