It is characterized by its branching, filamentous thallus that can vary in form depending on environmental conditions. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead consisting of a central axis with lateral branches. It thrives in freshwater environments, often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its ecological role includes serving as a habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems."
