    "intro": "Festuca callieri subsp. zederbaueri, commonly known as the Zederbauer's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
