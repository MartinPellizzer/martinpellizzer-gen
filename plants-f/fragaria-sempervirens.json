    "intro": "Fragaria sempervirens, commonly known as evergreen strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant bears red, edible berries similar to common strawberries, though they are typically smaller and more acidic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to native plant gardens and ecological studies."
