    "intro": "Fagonia myriacantha, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. Fagonia myriacantha is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
