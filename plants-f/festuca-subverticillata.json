    "intro": "Festuca subverticillata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Festuca subverticillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and dense growth habit."
