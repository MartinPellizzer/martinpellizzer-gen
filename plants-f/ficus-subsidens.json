    "intro": "Ficus subsidens, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It is well adapted to humid climates and can thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Ficus subsidens is often used in landscaping for its ability to climb or trail along structures, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and green walls."
