    "intro": "Ficus tenax, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant. Ficus tenax is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
