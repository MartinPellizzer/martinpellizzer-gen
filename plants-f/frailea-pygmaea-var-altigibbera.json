    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. altigibbera, commonly known as the dwarf fairy cactus, is a compact, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem that is typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise simple appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for succulent gardens. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
