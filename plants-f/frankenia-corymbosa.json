    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes or near the shoreline. Frankenia corymbosa is well adapted to saline conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
