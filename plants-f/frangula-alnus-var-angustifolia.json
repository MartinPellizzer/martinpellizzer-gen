    "intro": "Frangula alnus var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is often ridged and may peel in thin layers, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is also notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of materials for basket-making."
