    "intro": "Festuca carnica, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca carnica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh mountainous conditions."
