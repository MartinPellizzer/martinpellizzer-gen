    "intro": "Ficinia subacuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Ficinia subacuta is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study."
