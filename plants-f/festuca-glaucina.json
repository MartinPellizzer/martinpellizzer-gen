    "intro": "Festuca glaucina, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Festuca glaucina produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
