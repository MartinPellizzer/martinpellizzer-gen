    "intro": "Festuca tarraconensis, commonly known as the Tarraconense fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and pastures. Festuca tarraconensis is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
