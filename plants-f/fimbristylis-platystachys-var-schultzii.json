    "intro": "Fimbristylis platystachys var. schultzii, commonly known as Schultze's flat-stalked sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in environments with consistent moisture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Fimbristylis platystachys."
