    "intro": "Festuca alexeenkoi, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca alexeenkoi is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid or disturbed areas."
