    "intro": "Festuca pratensis f. parvillora, commonly known as the small-leaved meadow fescue, is a horticulturally important grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, dense foliage. This botanical variant exhibits smaller leaf blades and shorter internodes compared to the typical form of Festuca pratensis, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in temperate climates. The plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form a dense, weed-resistant turf. Its genetic distinctiveness makes it a subject of interest in plant breeding and ecological studies."
