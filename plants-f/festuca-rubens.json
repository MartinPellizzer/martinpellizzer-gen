    "intro": "Festuca rubens, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and reddish stems, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Festuca rubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is also used in erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
