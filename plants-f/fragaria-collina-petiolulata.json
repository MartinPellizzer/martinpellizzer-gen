    "intro": "Fragaria collina petiolulata, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries similar to common strawberries, though they are typically smaller and more acidic. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Fragaria collina petiolulata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
