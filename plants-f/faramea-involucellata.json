It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in cymes and are often accompanied by bracts. Faramea involucellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
