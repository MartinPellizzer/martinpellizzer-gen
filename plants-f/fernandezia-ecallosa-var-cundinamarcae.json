    "intro": "Fernandezia ecallosa var. cundinamarcae, commonly known as the Cundinamarca fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble ferns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pattern of small, scale-like structures along the margins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
