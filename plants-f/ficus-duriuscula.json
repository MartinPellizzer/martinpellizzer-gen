    "intro": "Ficus duriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. Ficus duriuscula prefers indirect sunlight and well-draining soil to thrive."
