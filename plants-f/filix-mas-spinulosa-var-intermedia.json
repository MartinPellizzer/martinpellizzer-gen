    "intro": "Filix-mas spinulosa var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to contribute to the ecological structure of its habitat."
