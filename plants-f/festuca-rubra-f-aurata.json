    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. aurata, commonly known as silvergrass or golden bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with fine, silver-blue foliage. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a soft, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden flowers, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This ornamental grass is valued for its attractive color and ability to form dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
