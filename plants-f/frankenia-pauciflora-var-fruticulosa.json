    "intro": "Frankenia pauciflora var. fruticulosa, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along dunes or rocky coastlines. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions."
