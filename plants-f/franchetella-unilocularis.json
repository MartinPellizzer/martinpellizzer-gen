    "intro": "Franchetella unilocularis, commonly known as the single-chambered bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can thrive in moist, nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are specialized for capturing prey, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for anchorage. The species is notable for its ability to photosynthesize while also obtaining nutrients through prey digestion."
