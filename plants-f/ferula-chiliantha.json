    "intro": "Ferula chiliantha, commonly known as the Chilean ferula, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its roots are fibrous and may have medicinal properties, though they are not widely used in traditional medicine. Ferula chiliantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
