    "intro": "Festuca clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and under-studied species in botanical research."
