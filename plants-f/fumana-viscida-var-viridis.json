    "intro": "Fumana viscida var. viridis, commonly known as green sticky vine, is a variant of the sticky vine species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a waxy surface that enhances its moisture retention. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
