    "intro": "Fiwa mushaensis, commonly known as the Mushinga orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Fiwa mushaensis is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
