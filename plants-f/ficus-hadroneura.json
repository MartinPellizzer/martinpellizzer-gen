    "intro": "Ficus hadroneura, commonly known as the red-veined fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is characterized by its striking, glossy leaves with deep red veins. The plant is evergreen and can grow as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical in shape and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native tropical environment. Ficus hadroneura is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
