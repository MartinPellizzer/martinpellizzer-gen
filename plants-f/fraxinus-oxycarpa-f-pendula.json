    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping white ash, is a cultivar of the white ash tree characterized by its cascading, weeping habit. This ornamental tree features delicate, narrow leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and graceful form."
