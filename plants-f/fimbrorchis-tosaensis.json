    "intro": "Fimbrorchis tosaensis, commonly known as the Tosa fimbrorchis, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique combination of colors, typically featuring a white base with purple and green markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
