    "intro": "Ficaria glacialis, commonly known as the glacier flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
