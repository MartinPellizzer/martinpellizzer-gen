    "intro": "Flourensia tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted flourensia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
