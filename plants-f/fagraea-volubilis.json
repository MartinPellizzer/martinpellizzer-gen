    "intro": "Fagraea volubilis, commonly known as the climbing fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that allow it to climb and entwine around other plants or structures. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and glossy, with a prominent midrib. Fagraea volubilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
