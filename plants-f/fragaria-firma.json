    "intro": "Fragaria firma, commonly known as the everbearing strawberry, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible fruits throughout the growing season. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruits are typically smaller than those of the common garden strawberry but are often more flavorful. Fragaria firma is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates and is valued for its extended harvest period."
