    "intro": "Freycinetia craterensis, commonly known as the crater cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Cycadaceae and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
