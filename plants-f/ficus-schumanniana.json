It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ficus schumanniana is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air and adapt well to indoor growing conditions."
