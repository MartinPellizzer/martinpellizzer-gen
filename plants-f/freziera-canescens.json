    "intro": "Freziera canescens, commonly known as the rough freziera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters during the spring. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Freziera canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
