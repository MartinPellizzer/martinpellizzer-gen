    "intro": "Fussia capillaris var. elegantissima, commonly known as the elegant hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland environments in Europe. It features slender, hair-like leaves that are finely textured and often form dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in water gardens and bog gardens."
