    "intro": "Festuca markgrafiae, commonly known as Markgraf\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca markgrafiae thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
