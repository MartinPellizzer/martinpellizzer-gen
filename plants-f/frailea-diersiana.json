    "intro": "Frailea diersiana, commonly known as the Diers' stone cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It is a small, compact cactus with a globular shape and typically features a single, thick stem. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it has a dense covering of white, woolly hairs that help protect it from intense sunlight. Frailea diersiana is well-suited for cultivation in arid environments and is often grown as a decorative houseplant."
