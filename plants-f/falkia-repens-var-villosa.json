    "intro": "Falkia repens var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy trailing falkia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of southern Africa. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale blue or purple, which bloom in clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
