    "intro": "Festuca cretacea, commonly known as Cretaceous fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Festuca cretacea produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
