It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
