It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
