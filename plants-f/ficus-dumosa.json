    "intro": "Ficus dumosa, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by inedible, round fruits that are typically green when mature. Ficus dumosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for those seeking a distinctive and low-maintenance indoor plant."
