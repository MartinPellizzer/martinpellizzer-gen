    "intro": "Festuca romoi, commonly known as Romo's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca romoi is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
