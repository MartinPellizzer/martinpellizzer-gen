It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
