    "intro": "Ficus verruculosa, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, which are typically clustered in spherical, greenish-brown syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. The roots of Ficus verruculosa are also known for their ability to absorb and filter water, making it useful in environmental restoration projects."
