    "intro": "Fraxinus nana var. atrovirens, commonly known as the dark green birch, is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are oval to elliptical in shape. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
