    "intro": "Fritillaria pinardii, commonly known as the Pinard's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. The plant features a fibrous root system and a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils and can remain dormant for several years. Fritillaria pinardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
