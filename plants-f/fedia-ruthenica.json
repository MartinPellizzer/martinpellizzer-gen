    "intro": "Fedia ruthenica, commonly known as the Ruthenian fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a tall, slender stem with compound leaves that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Fedia ruthenica plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
