    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica subsp. profunda, commonly known as the deep-rooted white ash, is a subspecies native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically male and female on separate trees. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils, making it adaptable to a variety of wetland environments. This subspecies is often found in floodplain forests and is an important component of the native flora in its range."
