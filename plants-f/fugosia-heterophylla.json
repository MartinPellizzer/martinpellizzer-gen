    "intro": "Fugosia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a wide range of morphological variations in its thallus structure. It typically grows on bark, stones, and soil in temperate and subarctic regions. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its thallus can vary in color from green to yellow or brown depending on environmental conditions. The plant's ability to adapt to different substrates makes it an important indicator species for ecological studies."
