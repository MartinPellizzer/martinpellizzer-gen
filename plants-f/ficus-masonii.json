    "intro": "Ficus masonii, commonly known as the Mason fig, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
