    "intro": "Freycinetia starensis, commonly known as the Tanna freycinetia, is a species of cycad native to the island of Tanna in Vanuatu. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feather-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
