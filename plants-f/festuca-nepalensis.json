    "intro": "Festuca nepalensis, commonly known as Himalayan fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly Nepal and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca nepalensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
