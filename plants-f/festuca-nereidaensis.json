    "intro": "Festuca nereidaensis, commonly known as the Nereid's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Festuca nereidaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and alpine habitats."
