    "intro": "Ficaria ranunculoides, commonly known as the buttercup sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, with five petals and a hairy center. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ficaria ranunculoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
