    "intro": "Fraxinus lentiscifolia var. tamariscifolia, commonly known as the tamarisk-fraxin, is a rare and unique variant of the fraxin tree. It is characterized by its small, grayish-green leaves that are similar to those of tamarisk, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its bark is smooth and often fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its hybrid traits and limited distribution."
