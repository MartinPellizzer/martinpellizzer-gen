    "intro": "Fumaria abortiva, commonly known as the abortive smokeplant, is a member of the Fumariaceae family. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Fumaria abortiva is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant's name reflects its historical association with abortion, though it is not typically used for medicinal purposes today."
