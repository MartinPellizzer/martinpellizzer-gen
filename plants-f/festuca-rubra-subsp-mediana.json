    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. mediana, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a distinctive reddish hue, especially under stress or in full sun. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and drought. Festuca rubra subsp. mediana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in low-maintenance landscaping."
