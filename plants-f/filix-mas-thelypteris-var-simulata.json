    "intro": "Filix-mas thelypteris var. simulata, commonly known as the false fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shady environments, often near streams or in damp woodlands. The plant features fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
