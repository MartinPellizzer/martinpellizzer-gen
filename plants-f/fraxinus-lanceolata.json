It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
