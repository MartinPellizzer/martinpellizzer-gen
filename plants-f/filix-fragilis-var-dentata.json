    "intro": "Filix fragilis var. dentata, commonly known as the fragrant fern or the toothed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that have a distinctive toothed or serrated edge. The plant produces spores in small, round, brown clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining soil. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
