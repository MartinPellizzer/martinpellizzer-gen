    "intro": "Freziera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly freziera, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, and it is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped, with a leathery texture, and the plant is adapted to thrive in cool, moist climates. Freziera tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
