    "intro": "Fagonia boveana, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Fagonia boveana plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
