    "intro": "Freycinetia subracemosa, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and tall, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged berries. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Freycinetia subracemosa is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its cultural and practical uses in local communities."
