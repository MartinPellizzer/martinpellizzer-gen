It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, fragrant white flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature."
