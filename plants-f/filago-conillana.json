    "intro": "Filago conillana, commonly known as the mountain filago, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Filago conillana produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
