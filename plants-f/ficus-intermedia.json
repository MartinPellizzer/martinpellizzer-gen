    "intro": "Ficus intermedia, commonly known as the variegated ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that often display variegation with white or yellow markings. It is a popular indoor plant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus intermedia produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits, though the fruits are typically not consumed by humans."
