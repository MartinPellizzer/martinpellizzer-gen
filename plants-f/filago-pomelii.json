    "intro": "Filago pomelii, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that grows in grasslands and open woodlands, often in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to dandelions, and it has a shallow root system. Filago pomelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
