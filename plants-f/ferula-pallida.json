    "intro": "Ferula pallida, commonly known as the pale ferula, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ferula pallida is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and low moisture conditions."
