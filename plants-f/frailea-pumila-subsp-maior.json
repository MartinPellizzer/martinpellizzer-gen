    "intro": "Frailea pumila subsp. maior, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a dense rosette of pale green, tuberculate stems that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, lateral branches. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive addition to xerophytic landscapes."
