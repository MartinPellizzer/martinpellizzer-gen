    "intro": "Franseria magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena franseria, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
