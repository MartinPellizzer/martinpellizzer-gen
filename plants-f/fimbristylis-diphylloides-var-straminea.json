It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along stream banks or in seasonally flooded areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts. The species is notable for its delicate, thread-like appearance and its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils."
