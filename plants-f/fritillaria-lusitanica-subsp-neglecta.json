    "intro": "Fritillaria lusitanica subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the Iberian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a contrasting black or dark purple rim. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in woodland or rocky habitats. It is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as parts of Spain and Portugal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
