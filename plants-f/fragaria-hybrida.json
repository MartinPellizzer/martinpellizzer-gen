    "intro": "Fragaria hybrida, commonly known as the cultivated strawberry, is a hybrid species within the genus Fragaria. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its distinctive red, fleshy berries that develop from an enlarged flower. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates, producing runners that help in vegetative propagation. Its flowers are typically white with yellow stamens, and the fruit develops over several weeks after flowering. Fragaria hybrida is widely cultivated for its sweet, aromatic fruit, which is rich in vitamins and antioxidants."
