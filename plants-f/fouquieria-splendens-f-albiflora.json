    "intro": "Fouquieria splendens f. albiflora, commonly known as the whiteflower ocotillo, is a rare and striking variant of the ocotillo plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems that produce clusters of white, tubular flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are typically deciduous, falling off during dry periods to conserve water. The whiteflowers make it stand out among other ocotillo varieties, which usually have yellow or red blooms."
