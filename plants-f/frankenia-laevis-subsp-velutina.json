    "intro": "Frankenia laevis subsp. velutina, commonly known as the silky frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
