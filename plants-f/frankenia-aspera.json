    "intro": "Frankenia aspera, commonly known as the rough frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Frankenia aspera is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes. Its botanical features make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
