    "intro": "Fagus echinata, commonly known as the European beech, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its dense canopy provides habitat for various wildlife, and its roots help stabilize soil. The European beech is also valued for its timber and is often planted in parks and gardens for its ornamental appeal."
