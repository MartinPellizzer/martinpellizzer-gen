    "intro": "Ficus subracemosa, commonly known as the clustered fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite or clustered. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences known as syconia, which contain both male and female flowers. Ficus subracemosa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in indoor environments. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to flourish."
