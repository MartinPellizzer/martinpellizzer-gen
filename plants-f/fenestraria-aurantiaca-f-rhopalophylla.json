    "intro": "Fenestraria aurantiaca f. rhopalophylla, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Sunstone,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically pale green with a reddish or orange tinge. The leaves are adorned with translucent windows, or fenestrations, which allow light to pass through, aiding in photosynthesis in its arid habitat. It produces delicate, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
