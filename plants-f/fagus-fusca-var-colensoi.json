    "intro": "Fagus fusca var. colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's beech, is a variant of the beech tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant is typically found in cool, moist environments such as mountain forests and is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native region. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique genetic and morphological traits."
