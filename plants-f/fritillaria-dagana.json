    "intro": "Fritillaria dagana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in rocky, arid environments, and they store nutrients to support growth during unfavorable conditions. Fritillaria dagana typically blooms in spring, adding a dramatic floral display to its natural habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
