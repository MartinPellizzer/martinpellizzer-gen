    "intro": "Fumaria atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a member of the Fumariaceae family, characterized by its slender, ascending stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the genus Fumaria. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
