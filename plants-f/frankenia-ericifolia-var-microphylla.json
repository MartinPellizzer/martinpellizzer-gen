    "intro": "Frankenia ericifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved frankenia, is a dwarf shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh coastal environments with high salt exposure. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune systems."
