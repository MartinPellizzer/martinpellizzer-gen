    "intro": "Ficus natalensis subsp. graniticola, commonly known as the granite fig, is a species of fig tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate periods of drought. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appeal."
