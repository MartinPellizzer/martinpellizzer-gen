    "intro": "Fagara acanthopodium, commonly known as the spiny devil's ivy, is a tropical climbing shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant but requires careful management."
