    "intro": "Frankenia stuartii, commonly known as the Stuart's frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are succulent and covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Frankenia stuartii is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems."
