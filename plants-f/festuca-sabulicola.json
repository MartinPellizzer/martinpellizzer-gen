    "intro": "Festuca sabulicola, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca sabulicola thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
