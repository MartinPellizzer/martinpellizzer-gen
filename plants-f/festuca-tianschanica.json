    "intro": "Festuca tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca tianschanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky and arid landscapes."
