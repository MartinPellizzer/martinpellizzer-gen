    "intro": "Franca nodiflora, commonly known as the creeping lantana, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in warm climates. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
