    "intro": "Festuca arenaria var. glabrata, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to sandy and coastal areas. It has fine, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating salt spray and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
