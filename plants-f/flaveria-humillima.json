    "intro": "Flaveria humillima, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, herbaceous stature. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help it conserve moisture in arid environments. Flaveria humillima is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
