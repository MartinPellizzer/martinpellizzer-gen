    "intro": "Ficus heteropoda, commonly known as the variegated fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often feature striking variegation of white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in small, round syconia. Ficus heteropoda thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
