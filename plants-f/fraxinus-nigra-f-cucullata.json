    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra f. cucullata, commonly known as the hooded black ash, is a naturally occurring variant of the black ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like leaves that give it a unique appearance compared to the typical black ash. The plant belongs to the Oleaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This form is less common than the standard black ash and is sometimes considered a subspecies or a form with specific ecological adaptations."
