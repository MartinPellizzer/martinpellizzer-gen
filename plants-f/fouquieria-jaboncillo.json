    "intro": "Fouquieria jaboncillo, commonly known as the soap tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, lantern-like fruits. Its bark contains a soapy substance, which gives it its common name and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. Fouquieria jaboncillo is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of its ecosystem."
