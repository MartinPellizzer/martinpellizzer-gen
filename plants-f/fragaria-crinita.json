It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and red, hairy fruits that resemble tiny strawberries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is edible, though often less flavorful than cultivated strawberries."
