    "intro": "Fagonia indica var. subinermis, commonly known as the Indian fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
