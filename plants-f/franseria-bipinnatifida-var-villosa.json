    "intro": "Franseria bipinnatifida var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy franseria, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that are covered in soft, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
