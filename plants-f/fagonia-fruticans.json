    "intro": "Fagonia fruticans, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny fruit capsules that contain numerous small, hard seeds. The plant has small, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Fagonia fruticans plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
