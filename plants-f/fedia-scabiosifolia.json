    "intro": "Fedia scabiosifolia, commonly known as the woolly fedia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Fedia scabiosifolia is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
