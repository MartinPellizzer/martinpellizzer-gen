    "intro": "Fragariastrum biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered strawberry, is a rare and delicate plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
