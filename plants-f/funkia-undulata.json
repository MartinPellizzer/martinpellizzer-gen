    "intro": "Funkia undulata, commonly known as the wavy arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, wavy-edged leaves that are typically green with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle floral element to wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to water filtration and habitat for aquatic life."
