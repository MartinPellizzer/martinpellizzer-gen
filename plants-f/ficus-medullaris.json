    "intro": "Ficus medullaris, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces a large, spiky fruit that is rich in carbohydrates. The fruit, which is typically harvested when green, can be cooked to a soft, bread-like consistency. The tree is often cultivated for its edible fruit and is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Its latex contains compounds that have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
