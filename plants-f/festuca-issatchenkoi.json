    "intro": "Festuca issatchenkoi, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca issatchenkoi is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found growing in rocky soils and open meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-maintenance, cold-climate gardens."
