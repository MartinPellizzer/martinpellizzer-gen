    "intro": "Festuca nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebrodi fescue, is a grass species native to the Nebrodi Mountains in Sicily. It is a low-growing, perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, mountainous climate of its native region. Festuca nebrodensis is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
