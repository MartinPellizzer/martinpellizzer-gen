    "intro": "Fagelia bartsiifolia, commonly known as the Ethiopian bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a contrasting throat. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fagelia bartsiifolia is considered a vulnerable species."
