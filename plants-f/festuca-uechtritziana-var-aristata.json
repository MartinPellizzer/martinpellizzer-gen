    "intro": "Festuca uechtritziana var. aristata, commonly known as the Alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces delicate, panicle-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid or high-altitude landscapes."
