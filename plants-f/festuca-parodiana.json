    "intro": "Festuca parodiana, commonly known as the Parodiana fescue, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Festuca parodiana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
