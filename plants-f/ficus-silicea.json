    "intro": "Ficus silicea, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found on rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its fruit, which is edible, is enclosed in a green, fleshy husk that turns yellow when mature. Ficus silicea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
