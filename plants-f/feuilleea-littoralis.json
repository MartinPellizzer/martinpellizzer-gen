    "intro": "Feuilleea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal leaf plant, is a unique species native to sandy shorelines. It possesses broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand strong sea breezes. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Feuilleea littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
