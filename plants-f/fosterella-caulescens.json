    "intro": "Fosterella caulescens, commonly known as the red-fruit fosterella, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and striking red berries that appear in clusters. The plant features grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the base. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with white petals that give way to the showy fruits. Fosterella caulescens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments."
