    "intro": "Flourensia riparia, commonly known as desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with soft, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-filled spheres similar to dandelion seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Flourensia riparia is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
