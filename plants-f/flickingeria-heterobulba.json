    "intro": "Flickingeria heterobulba, commonly known as the bulbous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a cluster of bulb-like structures that serve as storage organs for nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Flickingeria heterobulba is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
