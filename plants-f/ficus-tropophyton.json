It is a woody vine that is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Ficus tropophyton is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along surfaces."
