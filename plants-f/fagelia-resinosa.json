    "intro": "Fagelia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous fagelia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stem and broad,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of resinous fruits. Its ability to exude a sticky resin is a notable botanical feature, often used in traditional medicine. Fagelia resinosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
