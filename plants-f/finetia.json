It is characterized by its slender, bamboo-like stems and clusters of delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in humid climates. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom sequentially along the stem.
