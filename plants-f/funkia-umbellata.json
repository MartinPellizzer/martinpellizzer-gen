    "intro": "Funkia umbellata, commonly known as Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water conditions. The plant produces small, white, umbrella-like flower clusters that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in wetland environments. Funkia umbellata is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
