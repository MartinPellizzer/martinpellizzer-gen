    "intro": "Festuca ciliata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
