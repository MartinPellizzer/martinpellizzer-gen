    "intro": "Filix marginalis, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Filix marginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
