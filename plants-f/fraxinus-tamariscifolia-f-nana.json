    "intro": "Fraxinus tamariscifolia f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf green ash, is a compact, low-growing variant of the green ash tree. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its unique size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use in water features or as a ground cover."
