    "intro": "Festucella eriopoda, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festucella eriopoda is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
