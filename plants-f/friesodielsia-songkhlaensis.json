    "intro": "Friesodielsia songkhlaensis, commonly known as the Songkhla fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Thailand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
