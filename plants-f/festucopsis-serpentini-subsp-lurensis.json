    "intro": "Festucopsis serpentini subsp. lurensis, commonly known as the Serpent's Grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or barren soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized grass species."
