    "intro": "Festuca ovina proles sulcata, commonly known as sulcate sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawn and erosion control applications due to its hardiness and adaptability. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
