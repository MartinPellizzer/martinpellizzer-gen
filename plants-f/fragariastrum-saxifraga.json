    "intro": "Fragariastrum saxifraga, commonly known as the saxifrage strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, edible fruits that resemble strawberries. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, and it produces seeds in achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
