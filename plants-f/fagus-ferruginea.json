    "intro": "Fagus ferruginea, commonly known as the red-barked beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with doubly serrated margins. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, woody samaras. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
