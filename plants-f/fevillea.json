    "intro": "Fevillea, commonly known as the \"cushion plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, often forming low, mounded cushions of foliage. The leaves are typically orbicular or ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Fevillea species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America and Africa. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences."
