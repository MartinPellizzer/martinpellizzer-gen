    "intro": "Falkia oblonga var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf falkia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
