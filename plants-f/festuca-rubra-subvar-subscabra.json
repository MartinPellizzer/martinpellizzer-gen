    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. subscabra, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale to dark blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and erosion control due to its drought tolerance and hardiness. Festuca rubra subvar. subscabra is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
