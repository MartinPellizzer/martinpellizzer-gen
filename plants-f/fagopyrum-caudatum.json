It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescences that resemble the beard of a goat, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other plants such as buckwheat and sorrel."
