    "intro": "Festuca parvigluma, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or pale yellow in color. Festuca parvigluma thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
