    "intro": "Ficus asperula, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that have a rough texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fig fruits. Ficus asperula thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
