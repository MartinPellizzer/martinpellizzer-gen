    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. robusta, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and erosion control capabilities. Festuca ovina var. robusta is also valued for its ability to withstand drought and moderate grazing."
