    "intro": "Fraxinus sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese ash, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability."
