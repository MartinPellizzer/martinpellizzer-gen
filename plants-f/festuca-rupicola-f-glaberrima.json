    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous rock fescue, is a rare and distinctive grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome system that helps it anchor in unstable substrates, and its leaves are generally glabrous, or smooth, giving it its subspecific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-green flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
