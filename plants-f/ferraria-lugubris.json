It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces seed pods that split open when mature. Ferraria lugubris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
