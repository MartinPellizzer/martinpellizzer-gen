    "intro": "Fragaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered strawberry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant bears small, edible berries that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky soils. Due to its delicate nature, it is relatively rare and has limited cultivation outside its native habitat."
