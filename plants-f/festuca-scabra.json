    "intro": "Festuca scabra, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. Festuca scabra is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its tolerance to both drought and frost. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
