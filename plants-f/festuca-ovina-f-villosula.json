    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. villosula, commonly known as the silky sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler conditions. This variety is well adapted to rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with moderate climates."
