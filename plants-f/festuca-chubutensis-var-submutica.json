    "intro": "Festuca chubutensis var. submutica, commonly known as the Chubut hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Patagonian region of Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This variety thrives in dry, rocky, and often high-altitude environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
