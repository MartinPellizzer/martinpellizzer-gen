    "intro": "Festuca inopoda, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca inopoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
