    "intro": "Fimbristylis complanata var. keniaeensis, commonly known as the Kenia flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale brown flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of freshwater environments in its native range."
