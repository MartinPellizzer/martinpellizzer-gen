    "intro": "Fritillaria alfredae subsp. platyptera, commonly known as the flat-leaf fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange-red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open woodlands or meadows. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, alpine conditions, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
