    "intro": "Fragosa spinosa, commonly known as the spiny fragos, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, thorny spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Fragosa spinosa is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments."
