    "intro": "Fraxinus pistaciifolia var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved ash, is a variant of the ash tree characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive texture. It is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
