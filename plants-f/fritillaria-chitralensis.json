    "intro": "Fritillaria chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, which are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical gardens."
