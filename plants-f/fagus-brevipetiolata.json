    "intro": "Fagus brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-petioled beech, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Its bark is smooth and pale gray, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced as the tree matures. Fagus brevipetiolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
