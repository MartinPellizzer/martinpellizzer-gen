    "intro": "Ficus trachycarpa var. paucidentata, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
