    "intro": "Fortunatia acaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed fortunatia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its short, unbranched stem and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has no leaves along its stem, which is why it is referred to as \"naked-stemmed.\" It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
