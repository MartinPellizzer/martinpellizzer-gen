    "intro": "Festuca wightiana, commonly known as Wight's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca wightiana is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in alpine ecosystems."
