    "intro": "Fagus antarctica var. bicrenata, commonly known as the Antarctic beech, is a rare and unique variant of the Antarctic beech species. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Fagus genus. This plant is native to the subantarctic regions, particularly in New Zealand's subantarctic islands. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. The botanical features of this variant make it an important subject of study in plant ecology and evolution."
