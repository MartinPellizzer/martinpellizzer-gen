    "intro": "Fragariopsis, commonly known as the \"false strawberry,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Rosaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. They produce small, edible fruits similar in appearance to true strawberries, though they are not related. Fragariopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
