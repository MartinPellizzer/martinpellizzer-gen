    "intro": "Ficus inconstans, commonly known as the variable fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves that can vary in shape and size, often appearing asymmetrical. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically pear-shaped. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus inconstans is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
