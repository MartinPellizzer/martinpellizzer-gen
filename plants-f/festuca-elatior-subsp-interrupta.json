    "intro": "Festuca elatior subsp. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage that remains dense throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
