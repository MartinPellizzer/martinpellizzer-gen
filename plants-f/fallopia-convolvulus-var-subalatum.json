    "intro": "Fallopia convolvulus var. subalatum, commonly known as the alpine knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
