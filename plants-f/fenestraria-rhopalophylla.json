    "intro": "Fenestraria rhopalophylla, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems with distinctive, window-like openings called fenestrations, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
