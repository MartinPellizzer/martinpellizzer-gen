    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. hackeliana, commonly known as Hackel's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous slender spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
