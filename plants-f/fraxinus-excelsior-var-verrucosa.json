    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. verrucosa, commonly known as the warty ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its distinctive warty or knobbly bark. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in moist woodland habitats. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental bark and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
