    "intro": "Fendlerella cymosa, commonly known as the desert cress, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its small, white or yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Fendlerella cymosa is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
