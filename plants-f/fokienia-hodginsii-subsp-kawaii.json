    "intro": "Fokienia hodginsii subsp. kawaii, commonly known as the Japanese incense cedar, is a rare and ancient conifer native to southern Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by elongated cones that release seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation."
