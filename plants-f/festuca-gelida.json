    "intro": "Festuca gelida, commonly known as Arctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in alpine and arctic environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds. It is adapted to harsh conditions, including low temperatures and poor soil nutrients. Festuca gelida plays an important ecological role in tundra ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and habitat for microorganisms."
