    "intro": "Ferula sulcata, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its most notable feature is the milky sap it exudes, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Ferula sulcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in traditional medicine."
