    "intro": "Festuca stuartiana, commonly known as Stuart's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca stuartiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky slopes."
