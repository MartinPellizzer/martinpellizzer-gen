    "intro": "Festuca acuminata, commonly known as sharpleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Festuca acuminata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in supporting local wildlife. Its flowering spikes produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contribute to its ecological and botanical significance."
