    "intro": "Festuca matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca matthewsii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
