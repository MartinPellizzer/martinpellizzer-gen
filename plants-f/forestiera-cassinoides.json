    "intro": "Forestiera cassinoides, commonly known as the Florida beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple berries in the fall. These berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
