    "intro": "Fraxinus bungeana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Chinese ash or small-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its finely dissected, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The leaves are usually light green on top and pale underneath, with a serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
