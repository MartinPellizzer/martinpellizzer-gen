It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences with four to six flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Fimbristylis quadriflora plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
