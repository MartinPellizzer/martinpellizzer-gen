    "intro": "Flexanthera fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a pleasant, spicy fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Its bulbous roots store nutrients, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. Flexanthera fragrans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
