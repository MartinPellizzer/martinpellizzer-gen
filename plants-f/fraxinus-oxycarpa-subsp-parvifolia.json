It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by samaras with elongated wings. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
