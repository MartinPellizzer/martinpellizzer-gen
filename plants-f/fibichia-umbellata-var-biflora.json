    "intro": "Fibichia umbellata var. biflora, commonly known as the double-flowered fibichia, is a striking perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically pink to purple in color and are arranged in umbels, giving the plant its scientific name. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
