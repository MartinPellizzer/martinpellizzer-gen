    "intro": "Ficus silhetensis var. annamica, commonly known as the Annamite fig, is a rare and specialized species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically round and slightly elongated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
