    "intro": "Fragaria multifida, commonly known as the multifid strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that are similar in taste to common strawberries. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental and culinary purposes."
