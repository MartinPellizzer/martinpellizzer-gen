    "intro": "Ferulopsis hystrix, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its triangular, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinct texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Ferulopsis hystrix plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
