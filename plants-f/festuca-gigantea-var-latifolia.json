    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, tufted growth habit and broad, flat leaves that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine garden settings. Its ornamental value comes from its striking silver-green foliage and its ability to form dense, long-lasting clumps."
