    "intro": "Fimbristylis haspaniformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed flat sedge, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late summer. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with rhizomes that help in vegetative propagation."
