It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and pale yellow floral coloration."
