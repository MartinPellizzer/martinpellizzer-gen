    "intro": "Fanninia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Fanninia species typically thrive in humid, well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light. They are popular houseplants due to their compact size and ability to bloom year-round under proper care. The genus includes several species, such as Fanninia balfourii and Fanninia kirkii, which are prized for their ornamental value."
