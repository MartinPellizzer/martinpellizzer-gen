    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. sochondinensis, commonly known as the red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
