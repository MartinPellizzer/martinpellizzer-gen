It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. Ficaria nudicaulis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
