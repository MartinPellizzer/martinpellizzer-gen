    "intro": "Festuca algeriensis var. lamprophylla, commonly known as Algerian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and silver-gray leaf blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
