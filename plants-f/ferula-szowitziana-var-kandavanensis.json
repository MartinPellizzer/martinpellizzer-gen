    "intro": "Ferula szowitziana var. kandavanensis, commonly known as the Kandavan ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a long, branched inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic resin, similar to that of other ferula species, has been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
