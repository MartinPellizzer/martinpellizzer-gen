    "intro": "Fimbristylis tenera, commonly known as slender threadgrass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to aquatic conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of tiny, spike-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Fimbristylis tenera plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and serves as a habitat for various small invertebrates."
