    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf ash, is a compact variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically 5\u20137 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to grow in smaller spaces."
