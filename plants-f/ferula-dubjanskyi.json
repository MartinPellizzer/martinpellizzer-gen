    "intro": "Ferula dubjanskyi, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and medicinal properties. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features a thick, succulent stem and produces yellow flowers, with its most notable characteristic being the milky sap it exudes when damaged. This sap has been traditionally used in folk medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Due to its unique properties and habitat, Ferula dubjanskyi remains a subject of interest for both botanical research and potential pharmaceutical applications."
