    "intro": "Filago spathulata var. evaciformis, commonly known as the broad-leaved filago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a single umbel, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
