    "intro": "Fritillaria lophophora, commonly known as the Sierra Valley fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable wildflower in its native range."
