    "intro": "Ficus ampelos f. microcarpa, commonly known as the weeping fig or small-leaf weeping fig, is a cultivar of the ficus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its cascading, weeping growth habit with long, slender branches that hang downward. The leaves are typically smaller and more pointed compared to other ficus species, often with a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
