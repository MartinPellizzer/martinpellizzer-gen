    "intro": "Ficus ardisioides, commonly known as the red-veined ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent reddish veins, which give it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus ardisioides is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor environments."
