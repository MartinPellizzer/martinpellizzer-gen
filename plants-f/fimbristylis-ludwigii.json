It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats. Its slender, triangular stems are covered in fine, bristly hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences.
