    "intro": "Festuca neuquenensis var. aspera, commonly known as the Neuqu\u00e9n rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
