    "intro": "Ficus compressitora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are enclosed in a green, fleshy syconium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ficus compressitora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
