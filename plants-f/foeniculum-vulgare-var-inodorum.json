    "intro": "Foeniculum vulgare var. inodorum, commonly known as sweet fennel, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and yellow umbels of flowers. The plant is often grown for its aromatic seeds, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. Unlike the more familiar Foeniculum vulgare var. vulgare, this variety lacks the strong anise-like odor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and herbal cultivation."
