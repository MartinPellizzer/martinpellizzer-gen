    "intro": "Fordia angustifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Fordia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple in the fall. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is adaptable to a variety of soil types. Fordia angustifoliola is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in garden settings."
