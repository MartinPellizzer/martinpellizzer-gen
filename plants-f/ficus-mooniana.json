    "intro": "Ficus mooniana, commonly known as the moonleaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though these are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Ficus mooniana is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its striking foliage and ease of care."
