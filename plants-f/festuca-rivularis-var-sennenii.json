    "intro": "Festuca rivularis var. sennenii, commonly known as the Sennen's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
