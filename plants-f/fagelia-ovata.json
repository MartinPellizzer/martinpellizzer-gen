    "intro": "Fagelia ovata, commonly known as the ovalleaf fagelia, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Fagelia ovata is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
