    "intro": "Festuca skvortsovii, commonly known as Skvortsov's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler regions."
