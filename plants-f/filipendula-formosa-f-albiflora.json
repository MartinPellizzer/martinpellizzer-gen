    "intro": "Filipendula formosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered meadow rue, is a horticultural form of the meadow rue plant. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces fluffy, seed-filled capsules that mature in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. This cultivar is prized for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
