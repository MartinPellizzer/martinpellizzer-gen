    "intro": "Fourniera funebris, commonly known as the funereal acanthus, is a striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces showy, spire-like inflorescences with violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
