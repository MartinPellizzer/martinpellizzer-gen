    "intro": "Ficus polymorpha, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a single plane, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish hue. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, requiring careful maintenance to prevent leaf drop."
