    "intro": "Festuca membranacea var. albida, commonly known as the white feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, pale blue or white flowers in late summer, adding visual interest to the landscape. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
