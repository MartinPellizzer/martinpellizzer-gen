    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. parviflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
