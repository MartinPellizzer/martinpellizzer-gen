It features opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
