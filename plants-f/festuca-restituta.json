    "intro": "Festuca restituta, commonly known as the reed fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca restituta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
