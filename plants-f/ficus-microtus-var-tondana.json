    "intro": "Ficus microtus var. tondana, commonly known as the Tondana fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, green figs that ripen to a yellowish-orange color. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor cultivation as a decorative plant."
