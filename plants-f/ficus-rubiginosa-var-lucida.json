    "intro": "Ficus rubiginosa var. lucida, commonly known as the shining rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often veined with a lighter color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. The varietal name 'lucida' refers to its shiny, reflective leaf surface."
