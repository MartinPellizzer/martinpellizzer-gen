    "intro": "Fernaldia, commonly known as the \"scented fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of a few species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers. Fernaldia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are adapted to moist, shaded environments. Their botanical features make them of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
