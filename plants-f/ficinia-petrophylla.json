    "intro": "Ficinia petrophylla, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ficinia petrophylla thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in coastal dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds makes it well adapted to harsh maritime environments."
