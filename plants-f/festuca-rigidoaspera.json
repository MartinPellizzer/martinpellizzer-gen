    "intro": "Festuca rigidoaspera, commonly known as rigid rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, stiff leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with slender, awned spikelets. Festuca rigidoaspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
