    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. juncea, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are usually pink to reddish in hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes for its drought tolerance and wear resistance. Festuca rubra var. juncea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance lawns."
