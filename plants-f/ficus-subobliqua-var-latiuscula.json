    "intro": "Ficus subobliqua var. latiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leafed fig, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically broader than those of the parent species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically enclosed in a fleshy, greenish husk. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental foliage in horticulture."
