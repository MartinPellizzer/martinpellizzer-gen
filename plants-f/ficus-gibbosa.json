    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa, commonly known as the warty fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, warty bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in traditional medicine. Ficus gibbosa is also popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
