    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. litoralis, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is commonly found in dunes and coastal meadows, playing a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its resilience makes it an important species for coastal ecosystems."
