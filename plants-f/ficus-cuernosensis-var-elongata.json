    "intro": "Ficus cuernosensis var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated fig, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, giving it a unique, almost vine-like appearance. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and botanical enthusiasts."
