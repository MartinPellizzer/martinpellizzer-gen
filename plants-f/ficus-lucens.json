    "intro": "Ficus lucens, commonly known as the shining fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife and humans alike. Ficus lucens thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions."
