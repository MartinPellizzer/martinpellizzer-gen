    "intro": "Ferula heratensis, commonly known as the Herat ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula heratensis is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and as a source of natural compounds."
