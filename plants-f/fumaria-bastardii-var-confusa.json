    "intro": "Fumaria bastardii var. confusa, commonly known as the confused bladderwort, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the bladderwort genus. It is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
