It is characterized by its bright yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Forsythia pilosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its role in attracting pollinators."
