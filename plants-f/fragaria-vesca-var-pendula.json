    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. pendula, commonly known as the trailing strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with elongated stems that trail along the ground. The plant produces small, edible berries similar to those of the common strawberry, though they are typically smaller and more delicate. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
