    "intro": "Festuca nigriflora, commonly known as black-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark violet to almost black flowers, which contrast with its fine, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Festuca nigriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
