    "intro": "Falkia dichondroides, commonly known as the silverleaf daphne, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces elliptical, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
