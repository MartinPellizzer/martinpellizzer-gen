    "intro": "Festuca coiron, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to maritime climates with salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. Festuca coiron is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in salt-tolerant habitats."
