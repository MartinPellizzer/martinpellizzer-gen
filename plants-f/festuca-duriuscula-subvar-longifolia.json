    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula subvar. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often densely tufted and can grow up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
