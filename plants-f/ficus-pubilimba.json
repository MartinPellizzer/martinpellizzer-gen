    "intro": "Ficus pubilimba, commonly known as the pubescent fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically not consumed by humans. Ficus pubilimba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
