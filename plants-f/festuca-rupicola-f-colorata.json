    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. colorata, commonly known as the colorful rock grass, is a striking ornamental grass species native to the western United States. It features dense, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that range in color from blue-green to silver-gray, with the inflorescence displaying vibrant purple or pink hues. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, adding visual interest in both summer and winter. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
