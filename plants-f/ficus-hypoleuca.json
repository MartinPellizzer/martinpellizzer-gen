    "intro": "Ficus hypoleuca, commonly known as the white fig or white-veined fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. Ficus hypoleuca is typically grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, though the fruit is not commonly consumed by humans."
