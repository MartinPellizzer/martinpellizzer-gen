    "intro": "Fougeria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves and often produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Fougeria species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. The plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. They are valued for their ornamental foliage and are popular in horticulture for their hardiness and adaptability."
