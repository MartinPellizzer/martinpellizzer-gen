    "intro": "Festuca tenuifolia, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca tenuifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
