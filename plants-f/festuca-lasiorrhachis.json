    "intro": "Festuca lasiorrhachis, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca lasiorrhachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
