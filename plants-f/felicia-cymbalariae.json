    "intro": "Felicia cymbalariae, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, fleshy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cyme, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store moisture, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Felicia cymbalariae plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
