    "intro": "Festuca tenuifolia f. arenaria, commonly known as sand fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, sandy environments. The plant has a deep root system that enables it to access moisture in dry soils, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion."
