    "intro": "Freycinetia lunata, commonly known as the moonflower cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a stout trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional crafts, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
