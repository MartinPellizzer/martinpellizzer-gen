    "intro": "Ficus ischnopoda, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ficus ischnopoda is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
