    "intro": "Felicia dentata, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its spread. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Felicia dentata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
