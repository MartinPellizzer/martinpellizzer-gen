    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. dasyphylla, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
