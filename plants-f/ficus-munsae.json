    "intro": "Ficus munsae, commonly known as the Munsae fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus munsae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
