    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica f. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited green ash, is a botanical variant of the green ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive red or reddish-brown fruits, which contrast with the typical green fruits of the species. The plant retains the general morphology of Fraxinus pennsylvanica, including its compound leaves and samaroid fruits. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique fruit coloration and potential ecological roles."
