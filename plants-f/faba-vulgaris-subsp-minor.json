    "intro": "Faba vulgaris subsp. minor, commonly known as the dwarf lentil, is a subspecies of the common fava bean. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to other fava bean varieties. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain edible seeds rich in protein and fiber. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its nutritional value. Its botanical features make it a valuable crop in both traditional and modern agricultural systems."
