    "intro": "Freycinetia robinsonii var. meijeri, commonly known as the red-leafed freycinetia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the island of Java in Indonesia. It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its striking, crimson-colored leaves that contrast vividly with its slender, arching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by dark purple fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
