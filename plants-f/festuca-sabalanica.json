    "intro": "Festuca sabalanica, commonly known as Sabalan bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine and subalpine meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which are small and often clustered. Festuca sabalanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its delicate appearance."
