    "intro": "Festuca spaniantha, commonly known as the Spanish fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca spaniantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
