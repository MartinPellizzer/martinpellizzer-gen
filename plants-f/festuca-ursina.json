    "intro": "Festuca ursina, commonly known as bear grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, releasing lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Festuca ursina is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
