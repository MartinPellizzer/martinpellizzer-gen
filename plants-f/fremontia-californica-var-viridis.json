    "intro": "Fremontia californica var. viridis, commonly known as the green fremontia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to specific regions of California. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. Its leaves are usually green and lance-shaped, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
