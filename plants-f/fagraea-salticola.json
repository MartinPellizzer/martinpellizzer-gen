    "intro": "Fagraea salticola, commonly known as the jumping bean plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, elongated seed pods that contain larvae of the moth *Cydia salticola*. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a woody stem with opposite leaves. The seeds are enclosed in a fibrous, spiny capsule that can be manipulated by the larvae, causing the pod to \"jump\" when disturbed. This unusual behavior has made the plant a subject of both scientific study and popular fascination."
