    "intro": "Festuca elatior f. pseudomairei, commonly known as the Alpine meadow fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
