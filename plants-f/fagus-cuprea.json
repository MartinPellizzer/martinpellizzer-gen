    "intro": "Fagus cuprea, commonly known as the red-barked maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
