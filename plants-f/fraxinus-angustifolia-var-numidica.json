    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. numidica, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Ash or Numidian Ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It has a slender, upright growth habit with a tendency to develop a single trunk. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its fine grain and durability."
