    "intro": "Fragaria chiloensis var. scouleri, commonly known as the Chilean strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It produces small, bright red berries that are typically smaller than those of the common strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in coastal areas, often in sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in maritime environments. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them a valued plant in both ecological and culinary contexts."
