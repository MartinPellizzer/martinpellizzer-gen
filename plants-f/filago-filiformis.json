    "intro": "Filago filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf filago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, thread-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots and low-growing habit make it well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Filago filiformis is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean scrublands."
