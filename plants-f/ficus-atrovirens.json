    "intro": "Ficus atrovirens, commonly known as the black-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often deeply veined and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by figs that are typically hidden within a spiky, greenish husk. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Ficus atrovirens is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
