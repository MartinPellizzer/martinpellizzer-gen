    "intro": "Festuca waldsteinii, commonly known as Waldstein's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant has tufted growth habit with slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. Festuca waldsteinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and seasonal color variation."
