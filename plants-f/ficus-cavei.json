    "intro": "Ficus cavei, commonly known as the cave fig or rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often crinkled and have a leathery texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability. Ficus cavei produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is typically not cultivated for consumption."
