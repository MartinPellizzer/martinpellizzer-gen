    "intro": "Foetidia delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinium foetidum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and partial shade."
