    "intro": "Ferocactus tiburonensis, commonly known as Tiburon's barrel cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is a solitary, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed structure and spiny, glochidiate areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments. Ferocactus tiburonensis is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and salt spray, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
