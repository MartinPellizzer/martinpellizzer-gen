    "intro": "Ficus subulata var. boiei, commonly known as the dwarf ficus or miniature rubber plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, pointed, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in a dense, bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by pale green, round fruits that are typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for indoor gardening and bonsai cultivation."
