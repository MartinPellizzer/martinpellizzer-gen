The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in paniculate inflorescences, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a resilient species in desert environments. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall drought-tolerant nature."
