    "intro": "Festuca arundo, commonly known as rivergrass or tall fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist environments, often found along riverbanks and wet meadows. Its deep root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
