    "intro": "Festuca polycolea var. brevis, commonly known as the dwarf blue grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Asia. It features fine, silver-blue foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its dense, mat-forming growth habit. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of habitats, including meadows and forest understories."
