    "intro": "Fraxinus cinerea, commonly known as the gray ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and are enclosed in samaras with winged structures. Fraxinus cinerea is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
