    "intro": "Festuca glauca f. pubiculmis, commonly known as bluegrass with pubescent leaves, is a variant of the bluegrass species characterized by its distinctive silver-blue foliage. It is a cool-season grass that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in temperate regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which is a result of dense pubescence covering the leaf surfaces. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family."
