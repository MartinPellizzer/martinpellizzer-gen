    "intro": "Fezia pterocarpa, commonly known as the winged fezia, is a perennial shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, winged seed pods that give it its common name. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to tropical and subtropical environments, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas. Fezia pterocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
