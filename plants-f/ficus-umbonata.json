    "intro": "Ficus umbonata, commonly known as the African fig tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus umbonata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
