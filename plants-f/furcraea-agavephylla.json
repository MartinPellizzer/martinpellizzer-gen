    "intro": "Furcraea agavephylla, commonly known as the Mexican spineless agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often spineless. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
