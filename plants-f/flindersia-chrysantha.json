    "intro": "Flindersia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light grey bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats. Flindersia chrysantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
