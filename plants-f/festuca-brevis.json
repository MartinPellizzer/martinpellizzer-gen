    "intro": "Festuca brevis, commonly known as the short fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its flowering heads are small, spike-like clusters that produce numerous tiny seeds. Festuca brevis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
