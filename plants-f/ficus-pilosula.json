It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by inedible, round fig-like fruits.

Ficus pilosula prefers well-draining soil and moderate light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
