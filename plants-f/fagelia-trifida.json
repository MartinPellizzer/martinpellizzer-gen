    "intro": "Fagelia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed fagelia, is a rare and unique plant species native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three deeply lobed leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. Fagelia trifida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
