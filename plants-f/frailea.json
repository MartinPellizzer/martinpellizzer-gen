    "intro": "Frailea, commonly known as the \"living stone\" or \"lithops,\" is a genus of succulent plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Frailea species typically have a compact, rosette-like growth form, with leaves that are often colored in shades of green, blue, or red. They produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, usually during the warmer months. Due to their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, Frailea plants are popular among succulent enthusiasts."
