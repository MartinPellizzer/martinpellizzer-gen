    "intro": "Falkia repens var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf creeping falkia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in arid or semi-arid landscapes."
