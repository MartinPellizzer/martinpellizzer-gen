Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. The plant has a sturdy, upright growth habit and can develop a thick, woody trunk over time. It is relatively low-maintenance, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and interior decor."
