    "intro": "Fraxinus subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other ash species. The leaves are typically dark green on top and pale underneath, with finely serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
