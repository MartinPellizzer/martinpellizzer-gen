It is a member of the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow, sword-like leaves that are often lined with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically followed by orange or red berries. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
