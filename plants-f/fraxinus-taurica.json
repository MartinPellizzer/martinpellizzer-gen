    "intro": "Fraxinus taurica, commonly known as the Crimean ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southern regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. The tree is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe ecosystems."
