    "intro": "Freeria, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Freeria species are characterized by their intricate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, meaning they attach to trees or rocks for support rather than growing in soil. The genus includes around 100 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
