    "intro": "Fagara rigida, commonly known as the rigid fagara, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland and montane forests. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Fagara rigida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
