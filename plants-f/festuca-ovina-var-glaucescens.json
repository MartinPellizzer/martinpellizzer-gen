    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. glaucescens, commonly known as blue sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, blue-green blades that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated environments."
