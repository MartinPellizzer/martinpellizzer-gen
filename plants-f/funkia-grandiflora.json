    "intro": "Funkia grandiflora, commonly known as Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically green with a slight sheen. The plant produces striking white to pale purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the water's edge. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
