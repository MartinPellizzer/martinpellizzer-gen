    "intro": "Festuca dumetorum var. alpina, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
