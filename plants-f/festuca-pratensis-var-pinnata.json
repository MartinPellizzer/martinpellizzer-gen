    "intro": "Festuca pratensis var. pinnata, commonly known as slender meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often slightly hairy leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and is well adapted to a variety of soil types, including moist and well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration and as a component in native grassland habitats."
