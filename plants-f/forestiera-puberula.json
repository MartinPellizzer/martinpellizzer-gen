    "intro": "Forestiera puberula, commonly known as the smooth forestiera, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal interest make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
