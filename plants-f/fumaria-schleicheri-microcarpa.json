    "intro": "Fumaria schleicheri microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited poppy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Papaver and Eschscholzia. The plant features delicate, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant's small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
