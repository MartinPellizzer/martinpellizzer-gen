    "intro": "Ficus retusa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rubber fig, is a cultivar of the rubber plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed than those of the typical Ficus retusa. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and attractive foliage. Its growth habit is upright, with a dense, compact form that makes it suitable for indoor spaces."
