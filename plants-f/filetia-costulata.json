    "intro": "Filetia costulata, commonly known as the waxy leaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a decorative touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens."
