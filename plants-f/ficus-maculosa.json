    "intro": "Ficus maculosa, commonly known as the spotted fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a distinctive purplish or reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus maculosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
