    "intro": "Frailea larae, commonly known as the Lara's stonecrop, is a compact, succulent cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to grayish-blue spines, which help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Frailea larae is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
