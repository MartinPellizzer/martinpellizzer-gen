    "intro": "Frenela drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Frenela drummondii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
