    "intro": "Festuca subracemosa, commonly known as slender tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in rocky and nutrient-poor habitats. Festuca subracemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
