    "intro": "Ficus maxima, commonly known as the giant ficus or rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish-black berries. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Ficus maxima is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
