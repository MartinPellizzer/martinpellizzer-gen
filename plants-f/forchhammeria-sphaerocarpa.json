It is characterized by its short, thick stems and distinctive, spherical, spiny fruits that resemble small globes. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
