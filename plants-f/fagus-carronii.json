    "intro": "Fagus carronii, commonly known as Carron's beech, is a rare and endangered species of beech native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, oval leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, triangular nuts that mature in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane woodlands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
