    "intro": "Frangula polymorpha var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy boxthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. The hairy boxthorn is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to control soil erosion."
