    "intro": "Festuca uniglumis var. diandra, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
