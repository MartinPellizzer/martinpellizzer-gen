It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Festuca glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
