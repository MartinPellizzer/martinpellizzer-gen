    "intro": "Ficus communis, commonly known as the common fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves and produces a unique fruit known as the fig, which is enclosed in a protective husk. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with a specialized insect, the fig wasp, which is essential for its pollination. Ficus communis thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. Its roots can become quite extensive, making it a hardy and adaptable species in various environments."
