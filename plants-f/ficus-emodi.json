    "intro": "Ficus emodi, commonly known as the Kashmir fig or snow fig, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Ficus emodi is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in some parts of Asia."
