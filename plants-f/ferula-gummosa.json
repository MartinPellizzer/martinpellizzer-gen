    "intro": "Ferula gummosa, commonly known as the gum arabic tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. Its most notable feature is the latex it exudes, which is harvested for use in food, medicine, and industry. Ferula gummosa is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
