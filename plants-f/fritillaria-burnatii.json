    "intro": "Fritillaria burnatii, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
