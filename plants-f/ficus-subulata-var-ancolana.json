    "intro": "Ficus subulata var. ancolana, commonly known as the silver ficus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Mexico. It features small, ovate leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it a unique, almost metallic appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is its primary appeal."
