    "intro": "Fatsia oligocarpella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fatsia, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are typically narrower than those of its more well-known relative, Fatsia japonica. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
