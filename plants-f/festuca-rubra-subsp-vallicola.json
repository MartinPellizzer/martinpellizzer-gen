It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca rubra subsp. vallicola is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
