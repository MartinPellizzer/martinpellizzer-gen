    "intro": "Festuca boghisensis, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of northern Europe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for wetland environments."
