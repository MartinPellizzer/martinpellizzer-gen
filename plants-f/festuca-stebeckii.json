    "intro": "Festuca stebeckii, commonly known as Stebeck's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Festuca stebeckii is also of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates."
