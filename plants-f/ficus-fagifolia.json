    "intro": "Ficus fagifolia, commonly known as the Chinese banyan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits, which are enclosed in a tough, spiky husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus fagifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to grow in various indoor environments."
