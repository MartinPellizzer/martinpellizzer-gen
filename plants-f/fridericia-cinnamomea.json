    "intro": "Fridericia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon-flowered frostweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
