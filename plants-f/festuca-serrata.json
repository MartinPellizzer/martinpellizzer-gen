    "intro": "Festuca serrata, commonly known as bentgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blade-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca serrata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
