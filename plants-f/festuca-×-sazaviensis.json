    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 sazaviensis, commonly known as the Sazaviensian fescue, is a hybrid grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
