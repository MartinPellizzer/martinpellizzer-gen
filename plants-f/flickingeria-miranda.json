    "intro": "Flickingeria miranda, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant has small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Flickingeria miranda is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
