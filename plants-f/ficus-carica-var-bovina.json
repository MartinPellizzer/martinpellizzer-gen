    "intro": "Ficus carica var. bovina, commonly known as the buffalo fig, is a cultivar of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are typically larger and sweeter than those of the common fig. It thrives in warm, temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized for both its ornamental value and its fruit production."
