It is a shrub characterized by its small, yellow flowers and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant produces small, hard fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats."
