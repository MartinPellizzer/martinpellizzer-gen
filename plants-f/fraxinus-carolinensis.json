    "intro": "Fraxinus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in female and male catkins. The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation."
