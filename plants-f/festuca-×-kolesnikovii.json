The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and its flowers are small and wind-pollinated. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
