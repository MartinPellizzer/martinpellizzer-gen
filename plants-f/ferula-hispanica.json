    "intro": "Ferula hispanica, commonly known as Spanish cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong-smelling, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and can be quite deep. Ferula hispanica is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
