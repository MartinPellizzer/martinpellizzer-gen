    "intro": "Festuca pumila var. wilczecziana, commonly known as the Wilczecziana bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense mats. This variety is also important in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
