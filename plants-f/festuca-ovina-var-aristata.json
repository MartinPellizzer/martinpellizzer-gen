    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. aristata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca ovina var. aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
