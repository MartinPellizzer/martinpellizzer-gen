    "intro": "Fadogia triphylla, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Fadogia triphylla is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic bacteria."
