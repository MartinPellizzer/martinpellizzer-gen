    "intro": "Festuca shuka, commonly known as Shuka grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray florets. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca shuka is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
