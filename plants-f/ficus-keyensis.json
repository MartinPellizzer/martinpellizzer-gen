    "intro": "Ficus keyensis, commonly known as the Key fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Florida Keys and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, light green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found growing along the edges of swamps or in moist, shaded areas. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Ficus keyensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
