    "intro": "Frankenia pulverulenta var. grandifolia, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and withstand harsh environmental conditions."
