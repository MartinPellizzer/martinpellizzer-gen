    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa subsp. cuspidata, commonly known as the western black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and distinctive, compound leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by edible, round nuts encased in a thick, husky shell. Its bark is rugged and deeply furrowed, often developing a reddish-brown hue as it matures. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and for its ornamental and economic significance."
