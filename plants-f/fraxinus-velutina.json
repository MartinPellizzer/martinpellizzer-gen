It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a velvety texture beneath. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
