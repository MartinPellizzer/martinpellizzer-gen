    "intro": "Festuca panda, commonly known as panda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that resembles the fur of a panda, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Festuca panda is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
