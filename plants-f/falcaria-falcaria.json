    "intro": "Falcaria falcaria, commonly known as the creeping borage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, clustered fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded units when mature. Falcaria falcaria is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
