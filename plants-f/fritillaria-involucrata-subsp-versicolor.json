    "intro": "Fritillaria involucrata subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, purple, and orange, depending on the subspecies and environmental conditions. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Fritillaria involucrata subsp. versicolor is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes at high elevations. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticultural gardens."
