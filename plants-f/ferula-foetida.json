    "intro": "Ferula foetida, commonly known as the Armenian giant fennel, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that produce small, yellow flowers. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in local remedies. Ferula foetida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
