    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. purpusiana, commonly known as purple sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
