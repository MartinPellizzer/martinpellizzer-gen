    "intro": "Filago cephaloidea, commonly known as the helmeted filago, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact, rounded cluster that resembles a helmet, giving it its common name. Filago cephaloidea typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
