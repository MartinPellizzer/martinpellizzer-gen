    "intro": "Ficus cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous fig, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. Ficus cretacea is typically found in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a relict species, offering insights into ancient plant evolution."
