    "intro": "Ficus fructicosa, commonly known as the prickly fig or desert fig, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Ficus fructicosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in desert landscapes."
