    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. firmuloides, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in lawns and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to form a lush, low-maintenance turf. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and durability in various environmental conditions."
