    "intro": "Flueggea gracilis, commonly known as the slender flueggea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
