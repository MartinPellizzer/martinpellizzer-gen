    "intro": "Ficus brevicuspis, commonly known as the short-spined fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its short, sharp spines on the leaves, which distinguish it from other ficus species. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs. The plant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
