    "intro": "Fimbristylis tristachya, commonly known as the spike-rice sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It is a perennial herb with grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as swamps, rice fields, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Fimbristylis tristachya is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
