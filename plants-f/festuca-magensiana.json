    "intro": "Festuca magensiana, commonly known as the Magensian fescue, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca magensiana is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas and providing forage for grazing animals."
