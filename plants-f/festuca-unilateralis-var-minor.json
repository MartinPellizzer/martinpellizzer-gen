    "intro": "Festuca unilateralis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled or twisted. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
