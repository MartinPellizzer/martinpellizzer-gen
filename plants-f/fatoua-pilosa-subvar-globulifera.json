    "intro": "Fatoua pilosa subvar. globulifera, commonly known as the globular fatoua, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and spherical, clustered inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are arranged in globular clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Fatoua pilosa subvar. globulifera is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
