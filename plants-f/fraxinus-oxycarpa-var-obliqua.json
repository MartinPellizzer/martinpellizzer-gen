    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. obliqua, commonly known as the oblique hop-hornbeam, is a variant of the hop-hornbeam species native to the eastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
