    "intro": "Forgerouxa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, black seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. Forgerouxa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
