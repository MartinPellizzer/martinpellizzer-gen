    "intro": "Fritillaria meleagris subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Pyrenees region. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or orange in color, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a thick, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
