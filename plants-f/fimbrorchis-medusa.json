    "intro": "Fimbrorchis medusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in the Florida panhandle. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
