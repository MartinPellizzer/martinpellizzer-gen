    "intro": "Fritillaria nigra, commonly known as the black death lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically deep red or orange with black markings, resembling a funeral shroud. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Fritillaria nigra is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in folklore and medicine."
