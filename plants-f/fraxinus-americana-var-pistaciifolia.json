It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves that are typically a deep green on top and lighter green underneath. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in urban environments due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and tolerance to pollution make it a common choice for street trees and landscaping."
