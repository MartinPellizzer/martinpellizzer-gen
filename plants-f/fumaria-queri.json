    "intro": "Fumaria queri, commonly known as the Indian smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Fumaria queri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
