    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. leiophylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
