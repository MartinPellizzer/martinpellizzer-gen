    "intro": "Ficus tenuipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus tenuipes is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
