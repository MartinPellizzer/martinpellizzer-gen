    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. hervieri, commonly known as the Hervier\u2019s bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
