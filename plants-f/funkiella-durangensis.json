    "intro": "Funkiella durangensis, commonly known as the Durango funkiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Durango, Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
