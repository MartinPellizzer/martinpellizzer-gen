    "intro": "Festuca halleri var. borderei, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically a dark green color, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in its harsh habitat. Festuca halleri var. borderei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
