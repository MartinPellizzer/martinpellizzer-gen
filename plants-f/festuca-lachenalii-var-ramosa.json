    "intro": "Festuca lachenalii var. ramosa, commonly known as the ramose fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant is well adapted to cold, alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
