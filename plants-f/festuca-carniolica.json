    "intro": "Festuca carniolica, commonly known as Carpathian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Festuca carniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
