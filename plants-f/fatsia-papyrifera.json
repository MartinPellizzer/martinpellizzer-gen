    "intro": "Fatsia papyrifera, commonly known as the Japanese arum, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 60 cm in diameter, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a purple spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Fatsia papyrifera is also valued for its ability to tolerate humid conditions and its use in traditional Japanese gardens."
