It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover in dry environments. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
