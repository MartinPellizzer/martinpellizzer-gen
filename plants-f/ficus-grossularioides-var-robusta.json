    "intro": "Ficus grossularioides var. robusta, commonly known as the robusta fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
