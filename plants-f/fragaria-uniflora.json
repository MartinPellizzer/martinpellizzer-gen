    "intro": "Fragaria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to parts of Asia and North America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to cultivated strawberries but are generally smaller and less sweet. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
