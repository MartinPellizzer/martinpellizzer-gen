    "intro": "Fimbristylis caesia, commonly known as the silver hair sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with a pale or silver hue, contributing to its common name. Fimbristylis caesia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
