    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. curvispina, commonly known as the Curved-spine Fairy Cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Brazil. It features short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale blue spines that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
