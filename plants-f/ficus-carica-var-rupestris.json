    "intro": "Ficus carica var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock fig, is a variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, edible figs that are typically smaller and less sweet than those of the common fig. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
