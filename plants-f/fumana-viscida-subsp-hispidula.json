It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
