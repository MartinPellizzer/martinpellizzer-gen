    "intro": "Festuca sikkimensis, commonly known as Sikkim bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, high-altitude environments, often found in meadows and forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green hue due to the presence of certain pigments. Festuca sikkimensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
