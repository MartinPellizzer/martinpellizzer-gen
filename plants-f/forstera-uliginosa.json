    "intro": "Forstera uliginosa, commonly known as the bog heather, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and closely packed, forming a dense mat that helps retain moisture. Forstera uliginosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing peat soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
