    "intro": "Festuca glauca f. borhidiana, commonly known as the Borhidian bluegrass, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought once established. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is valued for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities in garden design."
