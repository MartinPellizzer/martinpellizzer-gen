    "intro": "Fumaria boraei, commonly known as the alpine smokeplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain ranges. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pale yellow to orange. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine ecosystems. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Fumaria boraei plays a role in pollination by attracting insects such as bees and flies."
