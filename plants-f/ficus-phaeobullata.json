    "intro": "Ficus phaeobullata, commonly known as the dark bullata fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus phaeobullata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
