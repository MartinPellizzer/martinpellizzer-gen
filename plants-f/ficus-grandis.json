    "intro": "Ficus grandis, commonly known as the giant ficus, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and robust growth habit. The tree can reach heights of up to 30 meters, making it a prominent feature in tropical landscapes. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, so it is important to handle the plant with care.
