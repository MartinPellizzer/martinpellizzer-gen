    "intro": "Fuchsia decussata, commonly known as the New Zealand fuchsia, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its pendulous clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from red to purple, are pollinated primarily by native birds such as the kerer\u016b (New Zealand wood pigeon). Fuchsia decussata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens, though it requires cool, moist conditions to thrive."
