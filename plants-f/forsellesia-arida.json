It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pendulous flowers that resemble orchids. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water in dry conditions. Forsellesia arida is known for its ability to bloom during brief periods of rainfall, making it a symbol of resilience in harsh climates."
