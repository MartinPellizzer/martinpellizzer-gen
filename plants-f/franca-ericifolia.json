It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that is typically covered in a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight.
