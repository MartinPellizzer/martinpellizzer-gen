    "intro": "Fritillaria lurida, commonly known as the pale bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
