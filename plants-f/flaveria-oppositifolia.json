    "intro": "Flaveria oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf false aster, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its scientific name, and its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Flaveria oppositifolia has a shallow root system and is adapted to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its role in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and reproductive strategies."
