    "intro": "Feuilleea rotundata, commonly known as the rounded leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which are followed by small, round fruits. Feuilleea rotundata is native to tropical regions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. It is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and promote healthy growth."
