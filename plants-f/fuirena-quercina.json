    "intro": "Fuirena quercina, commonly known as the oakleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that resemble oak leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by showy, cone-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its botanical features make it both visually striking and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
