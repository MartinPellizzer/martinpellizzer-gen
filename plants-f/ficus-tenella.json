    "intro": "Ficus tenella, commonly known as the curly willow fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and curling leaves that give it a unique, almost sculptural appearance. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to maintain its foliage's characteristic shape. Ficus tenella is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
