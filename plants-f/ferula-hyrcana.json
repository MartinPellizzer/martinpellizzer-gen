    "intro": "Ferula hyrcana, commonly known as the Hyrcanian ferula, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a long, branched inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic resinous sap is used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties. Ferula hyrcana plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments due to its deep root system."
