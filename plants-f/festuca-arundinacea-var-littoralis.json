It is characterized by its robust growth and tolerance to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
