    "intro": "Feuilleea obovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its broad, ovoid-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clustered fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Feuilleea obovalis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
