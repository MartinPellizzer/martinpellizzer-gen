    "intro": "Farquharia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology includes a single, slender stem and a single, showy flower that blooms for only a short period. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Farquharia is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
