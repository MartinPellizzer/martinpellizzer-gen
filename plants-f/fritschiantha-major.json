    "intro": "Fritschiantha major, commonly known as the giant fritschiantha, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its growth habit is primarily shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach significant heights. Fritschiantha major is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with ample sunlight."
