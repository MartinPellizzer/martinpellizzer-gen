    "intro": "Flourensia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf flourensia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, displaying a shrub-like structure with narrow, linear leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Flourensia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
