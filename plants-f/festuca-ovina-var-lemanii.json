    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. lemanii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its low-growing nature and dense root system make it highly resilient to harsh environmental conditions. Festuca ovina var. lemanii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
