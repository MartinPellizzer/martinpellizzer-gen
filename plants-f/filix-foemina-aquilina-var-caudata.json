    "intro": "Filix-foemina aquilina var. caudata, commonly known as the tailed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, feather-like leaves with a pale, almost translucent appearance, which are typical of the genus Adiantum. Its fronds often have a trailing or drooping habit, giving it a graceful, cascading look. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
