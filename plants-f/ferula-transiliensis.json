    "intro": "Ferula transiliensis, commonly known as the Transylvanian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. Ferula transiliensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
