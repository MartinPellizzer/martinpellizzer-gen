    "intro": "Festuca antucensis, commonly known as the Antuco grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca antucensis thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical research."
