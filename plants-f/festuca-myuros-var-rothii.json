It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
