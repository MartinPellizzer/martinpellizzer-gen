It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, typically displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in early spring. The plant grows in rocky soils and forested areas, preferring cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winters, and the leaves are typically broad and grass-like. This variety is of significant botanical interest due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
