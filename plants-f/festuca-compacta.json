    "intro": "Festuca compacta, commonly known as compact bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, dark green leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Festuca compacta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
