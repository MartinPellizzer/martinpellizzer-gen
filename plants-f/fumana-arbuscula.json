    "intro": "Fumana arbuscula, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Cariandraceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water. Fumana arbuscula is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in coastal or inland desert regions."
