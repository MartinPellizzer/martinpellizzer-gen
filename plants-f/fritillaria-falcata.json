    "intro": "Fritillaria falcata, commonly known as the sword-leaved fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or reddish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, typically growing in rocky or open woodland habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Fritillaria falcata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
