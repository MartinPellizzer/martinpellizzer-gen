    "intro": "Fritillaria armena var. lucida, commonly known as the Armenian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a strong, somewhat unpleasant odor, which is typical of many fritillaria species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
