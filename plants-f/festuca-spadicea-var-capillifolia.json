    "intro": "Festuca spadicea var. capillifolia, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like foliage that gives it a soft, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with pink or purple hues. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, grass-like texture."
