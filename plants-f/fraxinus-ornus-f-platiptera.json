It is characterized by its distinctive flat, elongated leaves that differ from the typical opposite leaf arrangement of the species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features include smooth, grey bark and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
