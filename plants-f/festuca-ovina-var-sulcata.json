    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. sulcata, commonly known as the Sulcate Sheep's Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
