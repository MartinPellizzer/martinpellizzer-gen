    "intro": "Forchhammeria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved Forchhammeria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks and are directly attached to the stems. Forchhammeria sessilifolia is adapted to the arid and rocky environments of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
