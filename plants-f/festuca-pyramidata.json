    "intro": "Festuca pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pyramidata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
