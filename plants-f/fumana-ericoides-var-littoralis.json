    "intro": "Fumana ericoides var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in dune environments or along rocky coastlines. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
