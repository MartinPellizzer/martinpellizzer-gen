    "intro": "Festuca jumpeiana, commonly known as Jumpea fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. The plant features tufted growth habit with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca jumpeiana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
