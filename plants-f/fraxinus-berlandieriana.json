    "intro": "Fraxinus berlandieriana, commonly known as Berlandier's ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows to a height of 5 to 15 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse via wind. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing some tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions."
