    "intro": "Festuca brevifolia subvar. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and fine, soft foliage. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The leaves are generally short and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, velvety appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
