    "intro": "Festuca delawarica, commonly known as Delaware fescue, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has fine, silver-green blades that are often matted together. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, dark blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to shady conditions and has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Festuca delawarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
