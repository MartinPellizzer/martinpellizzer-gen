    "intro": "Fragaria succulenta, commonly known as the succulent strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less sweet and more acidic than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its foliage and fruit."
