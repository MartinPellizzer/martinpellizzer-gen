    "intro": "Festuca varia var. croatica, commonly known as the Croatian variable fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
