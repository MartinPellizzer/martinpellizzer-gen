    "intro": "Faujasiopsis flexuosa subsp. bourbonensis, commonly known as the Bourbon fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
