    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in open woodlands. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
