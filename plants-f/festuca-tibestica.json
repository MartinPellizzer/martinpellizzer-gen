    "intro": "Festuca tibestica, commonly known as Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it forms dense mats that stabilize the soil. Festuca tibestica is adapted to low temperatures and high UV exposure, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
