    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy giant fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage, with leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
