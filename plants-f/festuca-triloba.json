    "intro": "Festuca triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and distinctive three-lobed leaves, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Festuca triloba has a clump-forming growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
