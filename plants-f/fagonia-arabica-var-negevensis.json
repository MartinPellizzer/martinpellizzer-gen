It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system for water retention. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is often found in rocky soils. Its resilience makes it a useful plant for xeriscaping and erosion control in semi-arid landscapes."
