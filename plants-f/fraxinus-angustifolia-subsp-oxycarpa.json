    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. oxycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring slender, often twisted branches and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along riverbanks. The subspecies is characterized by its narrower leaves compared to other Fraxinus species, making it easily distinguishable in the field."
