    "intro": "Ficus cuernosensis, commonly known as the horned fig, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted leaves that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically small and round. Ficus cuernosensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
