    "intro": "Fleischmannia microstemon var. microstemon, commonly known as the dwarf fleischmannia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for desert gardens."
