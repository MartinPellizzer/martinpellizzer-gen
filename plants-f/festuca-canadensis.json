    "intro": "Festuca canadensis, commonly known as Canadian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wetlands, and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions. Its leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca canadensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
