    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, low-growing structure. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in rocky or arid environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping and erosion control."
