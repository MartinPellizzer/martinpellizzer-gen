    "intro": "Felicia drakensbergensis, commonly known as the Drakensberg felicia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is found in the Drakensberg mountain range. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
