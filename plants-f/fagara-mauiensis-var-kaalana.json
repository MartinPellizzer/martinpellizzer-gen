    "intro": "Fagara mauiensis var. kaalana, commonly known as the Maui dwarf mahoe, is a shrub or small tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in native forests on the island of Maui. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
