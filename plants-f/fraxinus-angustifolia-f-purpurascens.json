    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia f. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf ash, is a decorative cultivar of the green ash tree. It is characterized by its striking purplish-bronze foliage, which becomes more intense in cooler weather. The leaves are typically narrower than those of the typical species, with a lanceolate shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. This cultivar is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
