    "intro": "Fallugia paradoxa, commonly known as the brittleblow or smooth bladderpod, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Fallugia paradoxa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
