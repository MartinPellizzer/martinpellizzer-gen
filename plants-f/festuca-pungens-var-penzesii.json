    "intro": "Festuca pungens var. penzesii, commonly known as the silverhair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-blue foliage, which results from its fine, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with dry, rocky conditions."
