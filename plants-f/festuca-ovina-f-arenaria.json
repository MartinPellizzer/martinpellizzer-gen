    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. arenaria, commonly known as sand fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to arid and coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils. It is often found in dunes, coastal plains, and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
