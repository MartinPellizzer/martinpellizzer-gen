    "intro": "Ferocactus hamatacanthus subsp. hamatacanthus, commonly known as the spiked hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in prominent, sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil. Due to its striking appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental cactus in dry gardens."
