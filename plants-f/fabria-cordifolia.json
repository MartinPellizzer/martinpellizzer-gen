    "intro": "Fabria cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and velvety in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Fabria cordifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
