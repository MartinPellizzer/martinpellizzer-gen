    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. glaucantha-hirsuta, commonly known as the hirsute glaucous fescue, is a variant of the rock fescue species. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are generally covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. The inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, typical of the Festuca genus."
