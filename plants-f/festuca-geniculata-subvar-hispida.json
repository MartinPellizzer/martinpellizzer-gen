    "intro": "Festuca geniculata subvar. hispida, commonly known as the hispid festuca, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common component of desert and sagebrush ecosystems. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat in arid environments."
