    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered tall fescue, is a cool-season grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that typically bear three flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally blue-green in color, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive turf. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other fescue varieties due to its specific environmental requirements."
