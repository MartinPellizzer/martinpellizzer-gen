    "intro": "Ficus foveolata, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually light green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, containing a sweet, edible pulp. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its compact size and ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in garden landscapes."
