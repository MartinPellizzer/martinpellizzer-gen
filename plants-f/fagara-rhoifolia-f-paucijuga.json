    "intro": "Fagara rhoifolia f. paucijuga, commonly known as the rare dwarf form of the Caribbean wax tree, is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. It features elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by oval, blue-black berries. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica and Hispaniola, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
