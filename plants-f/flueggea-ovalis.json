    "intro": "Flueggea ovalis, commonly known as the diamondleaf flueggea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, blooming in the spring. Flueggea ovalis is adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
