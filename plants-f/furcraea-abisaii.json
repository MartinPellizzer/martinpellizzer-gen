    "intro": "Furcraea abisaii, commonly known as the Abisai's sword plant, is a succulent shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It features tall, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in xeriscaped gardens."
