It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a pale blue or silver hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to whitish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting a range of pollinators and wildlife."
