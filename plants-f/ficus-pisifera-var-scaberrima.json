It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, rough bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes."
