    "intro": "Festuca rupicola var. rodnensis, commonly known as the Rodnian rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, dense foliage that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in open, sunny areas with poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky terrain."
