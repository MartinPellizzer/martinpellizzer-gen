    "intro": "Fraxinus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture on the underside, giving the plant its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in drooping clusters, and it produces small, winged samaras for seed dispersal. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
