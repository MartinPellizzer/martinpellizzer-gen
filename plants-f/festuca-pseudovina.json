    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina, commonly known as purple false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically purple or reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Festuca pseudovina is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to form dense, low-growing lawns in challenging conditions."
