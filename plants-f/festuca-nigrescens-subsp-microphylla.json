    "intro": "Festuca nigrescens subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features narrow, dark blue to gray-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue or purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
