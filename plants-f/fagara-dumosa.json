It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to the soursop but smaller in size. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Fagara dumosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
