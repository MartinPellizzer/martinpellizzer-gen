    "intro": "Fragaria gillmanii, commonly known as Gillman's strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its reproductive success. The berries are not only a food source for wildlife but also have historical uses by indigenous peoples."
