    "intro": "Festuca queriana, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. The plant has slender, tufted growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca queriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
