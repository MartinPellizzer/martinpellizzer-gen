It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold climates and poor soil, making it a hardy ornamental and forage plant. Its botanical features make it a valuable species in ecological restoration and landscaping projects."
