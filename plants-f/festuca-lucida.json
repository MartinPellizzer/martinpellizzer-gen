    "intro": "Festuca lucida, commonly known as shining fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca lucida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
