    "intro": "Funkia marginata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a distinctive white margin. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to wetland environments. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it both a useful wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
