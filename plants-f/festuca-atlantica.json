    "intro": "Festuca atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and tufted growth habit, which help it withstand harsh maritime conditions. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. Festuca atlantica plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the shoreline."
