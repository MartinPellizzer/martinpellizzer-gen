    "intro": "Ficus multistipularis, commonly known as the multistipular fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus multistipularis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities."
