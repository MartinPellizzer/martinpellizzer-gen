    "intro": "Festuca misera, commonly known as the dwarf fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca misera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant suitable for landscaping in cooler climates."
