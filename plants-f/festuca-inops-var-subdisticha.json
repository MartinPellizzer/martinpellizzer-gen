    "intro": "Festuca inops var. subdisticha, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
