    "intro": "Fraxinus curtissii, commonly known as the Curtiss ash, is a deciduous tree native to the central and southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 feet, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, often turning yellow in the fall. The Curtiss ash is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
