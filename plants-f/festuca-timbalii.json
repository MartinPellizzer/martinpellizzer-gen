    "intro": "Festuca timbalii, commonly known as Timbal's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pink or purple in color. Festuca timbalii thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in specialty gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
