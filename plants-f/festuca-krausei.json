    "intro": "Festuca krausei, commonly known as Krause\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
