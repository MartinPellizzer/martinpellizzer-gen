    "intro": "Fendlerella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Fendlerella species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with small, often blue or purple flowers. They have adapted to harsh desert conditions with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. The genus is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which is a dry, capsule-like pod containing several seeds."
