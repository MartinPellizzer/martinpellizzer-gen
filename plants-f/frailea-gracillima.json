    "intro": "Frailea gracillima, commonly known as the slender stonecress, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, spiny stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Frailea gracillima is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appearance."
