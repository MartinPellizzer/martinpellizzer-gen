It is characterized by its broad, fan-shaped leaves that can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in yellow or green hues, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Falcatifolium gruezoi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
