    "intro": "Fagonia arabica var. tilhoana, commonly known as the desert tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It has a woody stem that often branches near the base, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
