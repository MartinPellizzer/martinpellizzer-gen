It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca yalaensis has small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological systems in its native habitat."
