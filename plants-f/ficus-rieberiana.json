    "intro": "Ficus rieberiana, commonly known as the Rieber's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rieberiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor environments."
