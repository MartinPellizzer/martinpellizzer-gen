    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian Ash, is a variant of the Ash tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees."
