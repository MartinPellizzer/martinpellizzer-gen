    "intro": "Ficus pyrifolia var. pedunculata, commonly known as the Chinese banyan or small-leaf banyan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common banyan. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig fruits that are edible for certain animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to various growing conditions."
