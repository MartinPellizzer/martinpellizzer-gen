    "intro": "Fagraea rugulosa, commonly known as the rough-leafed fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Fagraea rugulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
