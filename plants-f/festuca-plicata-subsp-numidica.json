    "intro": "Festuca plicata subsp. numidica, commonly known as Numidian goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense spikes of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
