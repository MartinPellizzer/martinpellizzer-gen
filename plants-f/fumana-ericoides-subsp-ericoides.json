    "intro": "Fumana ericoides subsp. ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal environments."
