    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. planifolia, commonly known as red fescue flat leaf, is a low-growing, perennial grass species characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage. It features narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is well-suited to cool, moist climates and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually pink to purple in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a hardy and resilient groundcover plant."
