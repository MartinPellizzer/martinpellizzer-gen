    "intro": "Feuilleea claviflora, commonly known as the silver-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in well-drained soils. Feuilleea claviflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and mild aromatic properties."
