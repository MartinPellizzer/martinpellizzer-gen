    "intro": "Fritillaria yuminensis var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust underground bulb that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
