    "intro": "Ficus racemigera, commonly known as the clustered fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Its fruit, a small fig-like structure, is usually green when mature and contains a single seed. Ficus racemigera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
