    "intro": "Fimbristylis squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of tiny, three-lobed spikelets that are usually pale green or brown. Fimbristylis squarrosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
