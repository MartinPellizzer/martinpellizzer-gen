    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior edentata-pendula, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance. It is a deciduous tree with opposite, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas across Europe. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique, flowing form."
