    "intro": "Festuca cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it reflect intense sunlight. Festuca cuzcoensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
