    "intro": "Fraxinus longicuspis var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
