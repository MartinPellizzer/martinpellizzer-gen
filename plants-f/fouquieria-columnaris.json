    "intro": "Fouquieria columnaris, commonly known as the columnar ocotillo, is a distinctive desert plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that resemble a candlestick, which are often covered in small, spiny leaves. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Fouquieria columnaris produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
