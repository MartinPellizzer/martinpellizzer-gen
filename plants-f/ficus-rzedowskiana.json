    "intro": "Ficus rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Mexican fig, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Mexico. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and distinctive, pendulous inflorescences. It produces small, inedible fruits that are not commonly consumed by humans. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is highly threatened in the wild."
