    "intro": "Ficus ovoidea var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden fig or yellow-leafed ficus, is a variant of the ficus ovoidea species. It is characterized by its distinctive, oval-shaped leaves that often exhibit a yellowish or golden hue, especially under certain light conditions. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The leaves are typically glossy and can grow up to 15 centimeters in length, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
