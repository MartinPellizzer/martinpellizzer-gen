    "intro": "Fleischmannia arguta, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its showy yellow or orange flowers bloom during the summer months. Fleischmannia arguta produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
