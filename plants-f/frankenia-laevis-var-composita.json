    "intro": "Frankenia laevis var. composita, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Its botanical features include a woody stem and small, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss. Frankenia laevis var. composita plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native insects."
