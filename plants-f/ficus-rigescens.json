    "intro": "Ficus rigescens, commonly known as the climbing fig, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are typically clustered in small, round syconia. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus rigescens is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
