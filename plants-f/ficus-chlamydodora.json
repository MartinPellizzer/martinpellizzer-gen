It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus chlamydodora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
