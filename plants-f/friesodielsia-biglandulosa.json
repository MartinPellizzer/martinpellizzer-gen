    "intro": "Friesodielsia biglandulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in small, raised bumps, giving it a textured appearance. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish flowers that are often submerged or just at water level. Friesodielsia biglandulosa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
