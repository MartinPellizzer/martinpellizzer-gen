    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. rubra, commonly known as red sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that often turn reddish in color under stress or during certain seasons. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in marginal conditions. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often tinged with red, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
