    "intro": "Faramea multiflora, commonly known as the red-stemmed evergreen, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking red or purple stems that add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a glossy appearance, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Faramea multiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
