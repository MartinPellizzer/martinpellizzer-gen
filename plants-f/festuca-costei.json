    "intro": "Festuca costei, commonly known as Coste's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold and arid environments. Festuca costei is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
