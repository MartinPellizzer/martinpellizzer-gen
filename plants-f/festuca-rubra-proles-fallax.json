    "intro": "Festuca rubra proles fallax, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and the presence of purple or pinkish flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and moorland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats. Festuca rubra proles fallax is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to form dense, attractive turf."
