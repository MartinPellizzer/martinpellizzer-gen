    "intro": "Filago repens, commonly known as the creeping filago, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Filago repens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
