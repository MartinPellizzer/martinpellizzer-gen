    "intro": "Ficus leucotricha var. megacarpa, commonly known as the giant fig tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a food source in its native region."
