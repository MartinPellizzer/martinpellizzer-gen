    "intro": "Fagus menziesii, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The tree produces both male and female cones, with the female cones developing into woody seed cones that release seeds. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against wildfires and insect infestations. The Douglas fir plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for a variety of wildlife species."
