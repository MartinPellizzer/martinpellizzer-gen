    "intro": "Flotovia horrida, commonly known as the spiky swamp orchid, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces striking yellow and orange flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the muddy substrate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
