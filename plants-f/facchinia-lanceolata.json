    "intro": "Facchinia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
