    "intro": "Faramea occidentalis, commonly known as the West Indian beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright blue, fleshy berries. These berries are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
