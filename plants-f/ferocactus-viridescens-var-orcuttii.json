    "intro": "Ferocactus viridescens var. orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's green barrel cactus, is a compact, spiny cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is typically green to blue-green in color, with prominent areoles bearing clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. This variety is notable for its slow growth and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
