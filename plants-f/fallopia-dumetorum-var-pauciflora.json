    "intro": "Fallopia dumetorum var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burreed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color and bear alternate, lanceolate leaves. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose panicles, and it produces elliptical, ribbed fruits that contain several seeds. This variant is distinguished by its reduced flowering compared to other species in the genus."
