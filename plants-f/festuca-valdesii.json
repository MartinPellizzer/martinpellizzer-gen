    "intro": "Festuca valdesii, commonly known as Valdes' fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Festuca valdesii is characterized by its tufted growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
