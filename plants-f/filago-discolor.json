It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Filago discolor is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
