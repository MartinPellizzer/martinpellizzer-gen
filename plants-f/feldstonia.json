    "intro": "Feldstonia, commonly known as the beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in the fall, providing a striking visual contrast against its green foliage. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long and are arranged oppositely along the stems. Feldstonia thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
