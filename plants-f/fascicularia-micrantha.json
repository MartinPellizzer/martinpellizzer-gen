It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
