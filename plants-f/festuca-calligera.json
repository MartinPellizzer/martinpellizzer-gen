It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows, bogs, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually bluish-green and have a distinctive, silky texture. Festuca calligera produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
