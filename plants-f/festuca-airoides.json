    "intro": "Festuca airoides, commonly known as blue grass or purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and purple-tinted inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca airoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
