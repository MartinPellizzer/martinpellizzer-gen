    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. bohemica, commonly known as Bohemian sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, exhibiting good drought tolerance once established. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, resilient turf."
