    "intro": "Fagonia mollis, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Fagonia mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in desert landscapes."
