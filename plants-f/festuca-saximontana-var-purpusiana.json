It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in high-elevation environments. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of hair.
