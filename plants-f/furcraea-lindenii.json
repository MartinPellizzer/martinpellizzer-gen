It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Furcraea lindenii is well-suited for arid environments and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
