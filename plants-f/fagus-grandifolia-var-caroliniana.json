    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its seed dispersal method. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
