    "intro": "Fritillaria alfredae, commonly known as the Alfred's fritillary, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bell-shaped, often orange or red flowers. The plant belongs to the Liliaceae family and is known for its unique, often spotted or mottled flower petals. Fritillaria alfredae thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
