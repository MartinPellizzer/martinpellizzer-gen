    "intro": "Fraxinus acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its finely toothed, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fraxinus acuminata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
