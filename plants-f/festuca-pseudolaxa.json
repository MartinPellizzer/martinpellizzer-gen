    "intro": "Festuca pseudolaxa, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and grasslands. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca pseudolaxa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
