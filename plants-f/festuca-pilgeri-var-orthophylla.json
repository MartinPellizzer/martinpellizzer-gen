    "intro": "Festuca pilgeri var. orthophylla, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
