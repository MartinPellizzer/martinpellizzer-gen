    "intro": "Festuca proxima, commonly known as narrowleaf foxtail, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, needle-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, pale green to brownish flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Festuca proxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
