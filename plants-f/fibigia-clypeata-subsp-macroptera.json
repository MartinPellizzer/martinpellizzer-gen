    "intro": "Fibigia clypeata subsp. macroptera, commonly known as the giant rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are typically modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Fibigia clypeata subsp. macroptera is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established."
