    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. pratensis, commonly known as tall meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences containing small, two-lobed florets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, long-lasting turf."
