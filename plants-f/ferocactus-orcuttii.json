    "intro": "Ferocactus orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its thick, spiny skin helps it retain water in arid environments, and it has a slow growth rate. Ferocactus orcuttii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
