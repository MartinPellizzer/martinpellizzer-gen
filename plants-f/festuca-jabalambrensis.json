    "intro": "Festuca jabalambrensis, commonly known as the Jordanian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Jordan. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it withstand arid conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky and limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca jabalambrensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
