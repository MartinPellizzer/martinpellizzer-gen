    "intro": "Festuca vestita, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca vestita is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
