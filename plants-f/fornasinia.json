    "intro": "Fornasinia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, silvery down that gives it its distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits. Fornasinia thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
