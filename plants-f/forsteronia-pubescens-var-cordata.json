    "intro": "Forsteronia pubescens var. cordata, commonly known as the cordate forsteronia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically pubescent, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its unique foliage and modest floral display, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm regions."
