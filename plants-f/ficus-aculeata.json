    "intro": "Ficus aculeata, commonly known as the bristly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving them a bristly texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Its root system is robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ficus aculeata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability."
