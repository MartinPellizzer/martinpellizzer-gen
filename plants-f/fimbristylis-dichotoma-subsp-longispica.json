    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma subsp. longispica, commonly known as the long-spined flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its subspecies name, *longispica*, refers to the elongated, spiky bracts that characterize its floral structure. This species is often found in coastal and inland wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
