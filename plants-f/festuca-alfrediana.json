    "intro": "Festuca alfrediana, commonly known as Alfred's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Festuca alfrediana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and marginal habitats."
