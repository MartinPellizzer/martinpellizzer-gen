    "intro": "Frankenia pilosa, commonly known as the coastal sandplum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Frankenia pilosa is well adapted to salty air and periodic inundation, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ecological significance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
