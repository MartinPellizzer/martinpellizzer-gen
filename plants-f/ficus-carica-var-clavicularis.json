    "intro": "Ficus carica var. clavicularis, commonly known as the Clavicularis fig, is a cultivar of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and somewhat heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually harvested when they are fully ripe and soft. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to produce edible fruits under suitable growing conditions."
