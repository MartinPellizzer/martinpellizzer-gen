    "intro": "Fritillaria macrophylla, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, showy inflorescences composed of numerous bell-shaped flowers in shades of orange, red, and purple. The plant produces a cluster of large, elongated bulbs that serve as storage organs for nutrients. Its leaves are broad, grass-like, and often with a slight waxy coating. Fritillaria macrophylla is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
