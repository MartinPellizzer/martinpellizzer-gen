    "intro": "Ficus pisiformis, commonly known as the small-fig or dwarf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, though they may turn reddish in some varieties. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in indoor and outdoor settings."
