It features glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for small spaces and container gardening."
