    "intro": "Ficus pleyteana, commonly known as the Philippine fig tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in spherical, greenish-brown syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus pleyteana is also valued for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
