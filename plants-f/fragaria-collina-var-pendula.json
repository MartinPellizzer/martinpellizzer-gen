    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. pendula, commonly known as the trailing strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, trailing stems that produce small, white flowers followed by edible, bright red berries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the berries are typically smaller than those of common strawberries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
