    "intro": "Foeniculum salsum, commonly known as sea fennel, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its aromatic, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found growing along shorelines. Its seeds are used in culinary applications, similar to those of common fennel. However, it is less cultivated than its relative, the common fennel, due to its more specific habitat requirements."
