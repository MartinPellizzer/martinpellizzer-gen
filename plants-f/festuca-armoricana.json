    "intro": "Festuca armoricana, commonly known as the Armenian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca armoricana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
