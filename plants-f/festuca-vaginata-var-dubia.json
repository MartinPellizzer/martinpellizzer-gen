    "intro": "Festuca vaginata var. dubia, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as sand dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in dry landscapes. Festuca vaginata var. dubia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
