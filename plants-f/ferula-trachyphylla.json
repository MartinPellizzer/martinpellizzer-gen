    "intro": "Ferula trachyphylla, commonly known as the Afghan cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a strong-smelling, fibrous resin that has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Ferula trachyphylla thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at high altitudes."
