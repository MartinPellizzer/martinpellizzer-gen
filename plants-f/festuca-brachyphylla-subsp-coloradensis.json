    "intro": "Festuca brachyphylla subsp. coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming dense stands in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including drought and grazing, making it an important component of native plant communities."
