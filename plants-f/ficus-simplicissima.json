    "intro": "Ficus simplicissima, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive indoors. However, it requires careful attention to light and watering conditions to maintain its health."
