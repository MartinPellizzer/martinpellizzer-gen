    "intro": "Fittingia tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate fittingia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tuberculate (knob-like) leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
