    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. stricta, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable environments."
