    "intro": "Fallopia \u00d7 bohemica, commonly known as Bohemian knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Europe. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its robust, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish tint and produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in non-native regions."
