    "intro": "Ficus pachyclada subsp. arborea, commonly known as the giant ficus or tree fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
