    "intro": "Ferdinandusa speciosa, commonly known as the red mahoe, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and striking, palmate leaves that are often a deep green. The tree produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree in tropical regions."
