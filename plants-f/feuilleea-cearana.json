    "intro": "Feuilleea cearana, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety green leaves that emit a subtle bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with yellow stamens that bloom during the evening. Feuilleea cearana thrives in high humidity and requires indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorching. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
