    "intro": "Festuca amethystina subsp. amethystina, commonly known as purple false brome, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, tufted stems that typically reach heights of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a purple or reddish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
