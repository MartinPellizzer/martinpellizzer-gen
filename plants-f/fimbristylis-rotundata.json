    "intro": "Fimbristylis rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swales, and rice fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rounded at the tips, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Fimbristylis rotundata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
