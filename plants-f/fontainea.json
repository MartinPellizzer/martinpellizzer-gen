    "intro": "Fontainea, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its small, white or yellowish flowers and its ability to thrive in saline environments. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fontainea species are typically found in coastal areas, where they play a role in stabilizing shorelines. These plants are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mangrove ecosystems."
