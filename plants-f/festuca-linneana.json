    "intro": "Festuca linneana, commonly known as Lincoln's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, two- to three-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Festuca linneana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
