    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. officinalis, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are usually oval or ovate in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, hedgerows, and woodland edges, and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability."
