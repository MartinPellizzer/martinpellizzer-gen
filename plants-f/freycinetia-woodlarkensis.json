    "intro": "Freycinetia woodlarkensis, commonly known as the Woodlark cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the island of Woodlark in the Solomon Islands. It is a small, slow-growing cycad with a short, stout trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid tropical habitat. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
