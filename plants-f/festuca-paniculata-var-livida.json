    "intro": "Festuca paniculata var. livida, commonly known as the blue woodgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-green foliage, which is due to the presence of a bluish waxy coating on the leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces tall, slender flowering stems with panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing turf-like vegetation."
