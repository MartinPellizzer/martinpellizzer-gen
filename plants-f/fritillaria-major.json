    "intro": "Fritillaria major, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a tall, erect stem that bears multiple flower clusters at the top, giving it a regal appearance. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of bulbs. Fritillaria major is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
