    "intro": "Flindersia dissosperma, commonly known as the broad-leafed flindersia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall in its natural habitat. Flindersia dissosperma plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native regions, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
