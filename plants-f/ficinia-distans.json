    "intro": "Ficinia distans, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a flowering plant native to wetland and swampy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and colonize wet areas effectively. Ficinia distans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
