    "intro": "Fibigia khoshyelaqensis, commonly known as the Khoshyelaq sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
