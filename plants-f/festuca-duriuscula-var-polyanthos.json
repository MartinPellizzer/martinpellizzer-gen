    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. polyanthos, commonly known as the bluegrass meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green blades. The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
