    "intro": "Fernandezia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved fernandezia, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. Fernandezia parvifolia typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its simple yet elegant structure makes it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
