    "intro": "Fagus obliqua var. macranthera, commonly known as the broad-leafed beech, is a variant of the beech tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically smooth on the upper surface and hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by spherical, spiky fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The leaves and seeds of this plant have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits."
