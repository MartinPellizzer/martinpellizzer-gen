    "intro": "Festuca interrupta, commonly known as blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. Festuca interrupta is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
