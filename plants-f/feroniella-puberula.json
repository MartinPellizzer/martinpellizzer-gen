    "intro": "Feroniella puberula, commonly known as the hairy pitaya, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically orange in color and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its leaves are usually small and covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Feroniella puberula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of unique, flavorful fruit."
