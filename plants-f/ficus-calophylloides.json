    "intro": "Ficus calophylloides, commonly known as the glossy leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish color. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indoor environments with indirect light. Ficus calophylloides is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ease of care."
