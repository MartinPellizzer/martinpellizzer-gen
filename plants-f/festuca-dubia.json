    "intro": "Festuca dubia, commonly known as the desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca dubia is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring deep root systems and drought tolerance. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
