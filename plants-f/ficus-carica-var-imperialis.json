    "intro": "Ficus carica var. imperialis, commonly known as the Imperial fig, is a variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by edible fruits, which are typically larger and sweeter than those of the standard fig. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its fruit production."
