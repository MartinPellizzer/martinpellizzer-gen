    "intro": "Fraxinus platycarpa var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a variant of the broad-leaf ash native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its elongated, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is usually smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
