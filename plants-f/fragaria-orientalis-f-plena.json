It is characterized by its dense, double-layered flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular strawberries but with a slightly more intense flavor. It thrives in cool climates and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms."
