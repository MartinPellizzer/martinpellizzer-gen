    "intro": "Festuca sommieri, commonly known as summer fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in poor soil conditions. Festuca sommieri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
