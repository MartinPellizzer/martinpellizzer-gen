    "intro": "Fraxinus lentiscifolia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a unique variant of the ash tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, flowing appearance. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a moderate height, with a slender trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are simple, opposite, and oval-shaped, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful form."
