    "intro": "Fritillaria lusitanica var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange, often with contrasting patterns. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments, and it is often found in Mediterranean climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
