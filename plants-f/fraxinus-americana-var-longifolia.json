    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. longifolia, commonly known as the American waterfraxin, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping form and its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, simple, and typically have three to five lobes, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clustered inflorescences, and it produces samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found near water sources, hence its common name, and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
