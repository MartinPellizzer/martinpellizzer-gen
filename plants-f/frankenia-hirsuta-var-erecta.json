It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
