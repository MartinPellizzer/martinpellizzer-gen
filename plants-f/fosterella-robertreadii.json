    "intro": "Fosterella robertreadii, commonly known as the Florida pineapple cactus, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Florida Keys. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, pineapple-scented fruits. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival."
