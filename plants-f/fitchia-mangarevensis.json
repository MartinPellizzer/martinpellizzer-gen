    "intro": "Fitchia mangarevensis, commonly known as the Mangareva cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Mangareva in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
