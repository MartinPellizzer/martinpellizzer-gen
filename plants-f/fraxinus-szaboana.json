    "intro": "Fraxinus szaboana, commonly known as the Szab\u00f3's ash, is a rare and endemic species native to Hungary. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
