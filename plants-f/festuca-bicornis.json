    "intro": "Festuca bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca bicornis thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its low-growing form and hardy nature make it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
