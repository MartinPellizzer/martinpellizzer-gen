    "intro": "Fagonia pachyacantha, commonly known as the thick-stemmed fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in desert plants to minimize water loss. Fagonia pachyacantha produces yellow flowers, often in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
