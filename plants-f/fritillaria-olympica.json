    "intro": "Fritillaria olympica, commonly known as the Olympic fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cool, temperate climates. Its bulbs are adapted to survive harsh winter conditions, and it blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
