    "intro": "Festuca embergeri, commonly known as Emberger's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca embergeri is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its dense growth makes it an important component of high-altitude grasslands and a potential forage plant for livestock."
