    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 belensis var. intacta, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades. It typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in panicles, with small, two-lobed florets. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its fine texture and upright growth. The variety 'intacta' is noted for its ability to maintain a compact form without mowing, making it suitable for low-maintenance landscapes."
