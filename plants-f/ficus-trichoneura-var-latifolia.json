    "intro": "Ficus trichoneura var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are usually a deep green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
