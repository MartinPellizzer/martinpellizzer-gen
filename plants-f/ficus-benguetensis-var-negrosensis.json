    "intro": "Ficus benguetensis var. negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros ficus, is a rare species of fig tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves and small, clustered fruits. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
