    "intro": "Ficus katherinae, commonly known as the Katherinae fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and relatively low maintenance requirements. Ficus katherinae thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with consistent moisture."
