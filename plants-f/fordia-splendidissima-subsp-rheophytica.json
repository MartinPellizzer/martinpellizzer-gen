    "intro": "Fordia splendidissima subsp. rheophytica, commonly known as the waterfall fordia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky cliffs or along streams. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a sought-after species in specialized horticulture. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered vulnerable and requires specific care to cultivate successfully."
