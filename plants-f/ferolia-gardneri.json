    "intro": "Ferolia gardneri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems with thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Ferolia gardneri is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
