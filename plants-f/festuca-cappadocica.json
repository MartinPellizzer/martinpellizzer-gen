    "intro": "Festuca cappadocica, commonly known as Cappadocian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters tall. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Festuca cappadocica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
