    "intro": "Ficus rudis, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. Ficus rudis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and attractive foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
