    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native range."
