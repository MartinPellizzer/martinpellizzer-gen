    "intro": "Ficus trapezicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in lowland forests and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are typically small and yellowish. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
