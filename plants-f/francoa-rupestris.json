    "intro": "Francoa rupestris, commonly known as the rockfrancoa, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It has a compact growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Francoa rupestris is well adapted to dry environments and is often used in rock gardens or xeriscaping."
