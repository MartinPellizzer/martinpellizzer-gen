    "intro": "Funastrum dombeyanum, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or become upright, and it produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has alternate, narrow, linear leaves that are usually hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Funastrum dombeyanum is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and ornamental flowers. It is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
