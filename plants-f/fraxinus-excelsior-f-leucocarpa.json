    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited ash, is a variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow fruits, which set it apart from the typical green fruits of the species. This form occurs naturally in certain regions of Europe, often in areas with specific soil and climatic conditions. The plant retains the general morphology of Fraxinus excelsior, including its opposite, simple leaves and its characteristic ash-like bark. It is of interest to botanists due to its unique fruit coloration and potential ecological role in its habitat."
