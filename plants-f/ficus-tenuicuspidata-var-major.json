    "intro": "Ficus tenuicuspidata var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, warm climates with indirect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically harvested when they turn yellow or red. Its root system is fibrous, making it relatively easy to propagate through stem cuttings. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor conditions."
