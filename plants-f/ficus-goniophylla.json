    "intro": "Ficus goniophylla, commonly known as the golden fig or the Hawaiian fig, is a tropical plant native to the islands of Hawaii. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus goniophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
