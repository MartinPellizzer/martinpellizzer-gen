    "intro": "Fragariastrum elatior, commonly known as the tall strawberry plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to strawberries but are typically smaller and less common in cultivation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
