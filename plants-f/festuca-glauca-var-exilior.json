    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. exilior, commonly known as bluegrass meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It features fine, bluish-gray foliage that is often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh, arid conditions."
