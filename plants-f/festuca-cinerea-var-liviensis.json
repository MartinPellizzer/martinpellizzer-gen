    "intro": "Festuca cinerea var. liviensis, commonly known as the gray hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. This variety is typically found in moist, calcareous soils, often in wet meadows or along stream banks. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects in suitable habitats."
