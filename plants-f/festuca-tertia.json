    "intro": "Festuca tertia, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Festuca tertia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
