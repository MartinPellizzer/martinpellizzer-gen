    "intro": "Ficinia incomtula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Australia. It typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, preferring moist, poorly drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it a distinct appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Ficinia incomtula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
