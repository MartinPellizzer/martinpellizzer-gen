    "intro": "Festuca urvilleana, commonly known as the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic environments. Festuca urvilleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a ground cover in cooler climates."
