    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. psammophila, commonly known as sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray appearance, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
