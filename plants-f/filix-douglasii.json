    "intro": "Filix douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States. It features a tall, erect rhizome with a dense cluster of dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a lush, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
