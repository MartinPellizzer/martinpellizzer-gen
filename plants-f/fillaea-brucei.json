    "intro": "Fillaea brucei, commonly known as the Bruce's fillaea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fillaea brucei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
