    "intro": "Fumana glutinosa var. juniperina, commonly known as the sticky fumana or juniper fumana, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that emit a strong aromatic scent, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Fumana. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming umbels that are often overlooked due to the plant's unusual appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
