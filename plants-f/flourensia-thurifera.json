    "intro": "Flourensia thurifera, commonly known as the fragrant flourensia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
