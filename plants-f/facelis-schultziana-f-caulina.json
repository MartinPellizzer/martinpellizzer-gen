    "intro": "Facelis schultziana f. caulina, commonly known as the caudiculate facelis, is a unique variant of the species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, swollen caudex, which serves as a water storage organ, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, with the foliage concentrated near the base of the caudex. This cultivar is prized for its striking appearance and adaptability to dry environments."
