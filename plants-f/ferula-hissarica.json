    "intro": "Ferula hissarica, commonly known as the Hissaric wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula hissarica thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
