    "intro": "Fordia stipularis, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Fordia stipularis is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and winter interest, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
