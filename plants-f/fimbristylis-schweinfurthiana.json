    "intro": "Fimbristylis schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are usually borne on short, leafy branches. Fimbristylis schweinfurthiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
