    "intro": "Festuca tectoria, commonly known as roof grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow, flat, and have a bluish-green color, which helps it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is often used in restoration ecology due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
