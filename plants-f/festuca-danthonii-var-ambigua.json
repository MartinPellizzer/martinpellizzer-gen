    "intro": "Festuca danthonii var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
