    "intro": "Fraxinus paxiana var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ash tree. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its small, elongated leaves that are typically a dull green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
