    "intro": "Funkia alba, commonly known as the white arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white, lily-like flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and water gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense underwater mats. Funkia alba is often used in water feature landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to help control algae by competing for nutrients."
