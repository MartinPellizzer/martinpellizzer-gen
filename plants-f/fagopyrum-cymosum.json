    "intro": "Fagopyrum cymosum, commonly known as common buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by dark purple, egg-shaped berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
