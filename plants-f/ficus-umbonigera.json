    "intro": "Ficus umbonigera, commonly known as the broad-leafed fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus umbonigera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
