    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. angustiflora, commonly known as narrowleaf sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
