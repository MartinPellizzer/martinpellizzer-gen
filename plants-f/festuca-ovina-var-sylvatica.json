    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. sylvatica, commonly known as woodland sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming a carpet-like ground cover. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in woodland settings. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
