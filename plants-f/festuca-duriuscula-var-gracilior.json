    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. gracilior, commonly known as slender mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like flowers. Festuca duriuscula var. gracilior plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
