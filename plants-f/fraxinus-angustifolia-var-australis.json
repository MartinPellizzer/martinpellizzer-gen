    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. australis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash subsp. australis, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded, open crown. The leaves are alternate, simple, and lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats."
