    "intro": "Freycinetia parksii, commonly known as the Pohnpei cycad, is a unique species native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid tropical climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
