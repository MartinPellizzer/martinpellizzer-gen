    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. columbiana, commonly known as bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ecological importance, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
