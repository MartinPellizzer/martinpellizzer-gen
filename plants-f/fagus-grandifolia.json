    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its dense canopy provides habitat for various wildlife species. The American beech is also valued for its durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
