    "intro": "Fedia auricula var. dasycarpa, commonly known as the woolly ear fungus, is a distinctive polypore mushroom characterized by its dense, velvety cap that resembles a sheep's ear. It typically grows on dead wood, particularly in temperate and subtropical regions, and is often found in forested areas. The cap is usually pale to yellowish in color, with a fibrous texture that becomes more pronounced as the mushroom matures. Its spore-bearing surface is smooth and often has a slightly sticky coating, aiding in spore dispersal. This variant is notable for its unique appearance and ecological role in decomposing woody material."
