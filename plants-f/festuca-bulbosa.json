    "intro": "Festuca bulbosa, commonly known as bulbous fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca bulbosa is often found in rocky or alpine environments due to its tolerance for cold and poor soil conditions. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in mountainous areas."
