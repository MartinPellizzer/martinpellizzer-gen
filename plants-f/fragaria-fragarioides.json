    "intro": "Fragaria fragarioides, commonly known as the creeping strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible, red berries resembling strawberries but with a more acidic flavor. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in woodland areas. The botanical features of Fragaria fragarioides make it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive in certain regions."
