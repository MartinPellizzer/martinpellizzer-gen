    "intro": "Fritillaria karadaghensis, commonly known as the Karadag fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
