    "intro": "Festuca glauca subsp. caesia, commonly known as bluegrass or mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
