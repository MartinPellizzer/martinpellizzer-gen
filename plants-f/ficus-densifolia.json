    "intro": "Ficus densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often glossy and arranged in an alternate pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden within the leaves, a feature common in many fig species. Its fruit, known as a fig, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior with tiny seeds. Ficus densifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
