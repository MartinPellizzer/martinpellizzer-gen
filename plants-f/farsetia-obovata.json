    "intro": "Farsetia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate farsetia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
