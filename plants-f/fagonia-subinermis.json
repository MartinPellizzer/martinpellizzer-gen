    "intro": "Fagonia subinermis, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Fagonia subinermis is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
