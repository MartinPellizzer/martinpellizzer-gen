    "intro": "Fraxinus campestris, commonly known as the field ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clustered panicles in spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks."
