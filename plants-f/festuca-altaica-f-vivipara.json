    "intro": "Festuca altaica f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, typically forming low, mat-like colonies. The plant is notable for its ability to produce viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants without requiring a full germination process. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a compact panicle. This variety is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in poor soils and cold climates."
