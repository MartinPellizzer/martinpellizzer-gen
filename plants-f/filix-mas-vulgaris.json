    "intro": "Filix-mas vulgaris, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, tooth-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true leaves and flowers. Filix-mas vulgaris is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization."
