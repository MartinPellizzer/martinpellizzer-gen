    "intro": "Furcraea aspera, commonly known as the African sword plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features tall, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
