    "intro": "Fordia splendidissima, commonly known as the winter daphne, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has small, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9. Fordia splendidissima is valued for its early blooming habit and winter interest in the garden."
