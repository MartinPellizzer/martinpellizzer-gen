    "intro": "Festuca pulchra, commonly known as the beautiful bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca pulchra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
