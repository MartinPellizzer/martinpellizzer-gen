    "intro": "Forasaccus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may float on the water surface. Forasaccus ciliatus is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for nutrition."
