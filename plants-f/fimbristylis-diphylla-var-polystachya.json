    "intro": "Fimbristylis diphylla var. polystachya, commonly known as the clustered spike-rush, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically arranged in clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy and ecology."
