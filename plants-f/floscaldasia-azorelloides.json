    "intro": "Floscaldasia azorelloides, commonly known as the Azorean starflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the Azores. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
