    "intro": "Fabricia hamosa, commonly known as the common velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in agricultural fields. Fabricia hamosa is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit."
