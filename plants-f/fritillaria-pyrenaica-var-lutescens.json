    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica var. lutescens, commonly known as the Pyrenean yellow fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a fibrous root system typical of many bulbous species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
