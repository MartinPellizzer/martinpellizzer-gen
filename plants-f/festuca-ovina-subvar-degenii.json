    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. degenii, commonly known as Degener's sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
