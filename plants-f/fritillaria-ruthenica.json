    "intro": "Fritillaria ruthenica, commonly known as the Caucasian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters and produces narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but remains a rare and protected species in the wild."
