    "intro": "Fagonia californica subsp. insularis, commonly known as the San Clemente fagonia, is a shrub native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It is characterized by its small, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in coastal scrub habitats and is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native range. It is considered rare and is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. This subspecies plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for native wildlife."
