    "intro": "Ficus caulothyrsa, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance. The species is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air."
