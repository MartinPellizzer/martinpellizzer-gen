    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. viridis, commonly known as green sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. It is native to Europe and western Asia and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, bluish-green, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
