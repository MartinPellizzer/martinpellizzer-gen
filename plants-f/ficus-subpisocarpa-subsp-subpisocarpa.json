    "intro": "Ficus subpisocarpa subsp. subpisocarpa, commonly known as the Borneo fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are usually green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warmer climates."
