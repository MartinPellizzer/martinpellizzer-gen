    "intro": "Ficus carica var. riparium, commonly known as the river fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to regions near rivers and moist environments. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often slightly lobed and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when unripe and turn purple or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture, making it suitable for riparian zones. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential fruit production in appropriate climates."
