It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and tundra regions. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in ecologically sensitive areas."
