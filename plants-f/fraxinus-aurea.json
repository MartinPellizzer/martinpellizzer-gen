    "intro": "Fraxinus aurea, commonly known as the golden ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which turns vibrant shades of orange and red in the fall. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The golden ash is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal color and ecological benefits."
