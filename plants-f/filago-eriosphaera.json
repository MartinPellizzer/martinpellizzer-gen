    "intro": "Filago eriosphaera, commonly known as the woolly sandbur, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Filago eriosphaera thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
