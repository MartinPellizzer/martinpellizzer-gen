    "intro": "Fimbristylis diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, triangular stems that are often densely clustered, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous seeds that are dispersed by water or wind. Fimbristylis diphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
