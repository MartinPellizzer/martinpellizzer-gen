    "intro": "Festuca phleoides, commonly known as the mountain feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Festuca phleoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
