The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full to partial sunlight. Festuca rubra subsp. schlagintweitii is often used in landscaping and as a turfgrass due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
