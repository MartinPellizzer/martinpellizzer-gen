    "intro": "Ficus stipitata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, waxy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden beneath its leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that are edible for some bird species but generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in landscaping. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
