    "intro": "Festuca wolgensis, commonly known as the Wolgen fescue, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or pale blue in color. Festuca wolgensis is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
