It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by elliptical, dark blue berries. Fagelia tenuis is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in shaded garden settings. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
