    "intro": "Filago arenaria, commonly known as the sand filago, is a low-growing plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Filago arenaria plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
