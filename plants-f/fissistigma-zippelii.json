    "intro": "Fissistigma zippelii, commonly known as the Zippel's fissistigma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that resemble those of other members of its family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in Central America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
