    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subvar. monophylla, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a wild strawberry species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a low-growing habit, characterized by trifoliate leaves and small, delicate flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
