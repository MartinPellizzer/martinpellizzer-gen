    "intro": "Festuca saxatilis, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca saxatilis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, mountainous habitats."
