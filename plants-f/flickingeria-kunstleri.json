    "intro": "Flickingeria kunstleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, succulent stems and waxy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
