    "intro": "Fleischmannia petiolata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and hairy, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Fleischmannia petiolata is known for its ability to store water in its succulent stems, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
