It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically not consumed by humans. Ficus multiramea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
