    "intro": "Fagarastrum, commonly known as the \"wild pepper tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Annonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that often have a star-shaped appearance. Fagarastrum species typically produce small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a peppery or spicy flavor. These plants are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
