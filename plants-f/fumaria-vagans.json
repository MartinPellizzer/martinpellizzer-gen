    "intro": "Fumaria vagans, commonly known as the wandering fumitory, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open, sunny habitats. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
