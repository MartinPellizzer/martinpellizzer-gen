    "intro": "Fritillaria guicciardii var. zahnii, commonly known as the Zahn's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color, with a distinctive, often dark, central spot. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
