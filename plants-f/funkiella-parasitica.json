    "intro": "Funkiella parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a rare and specialized plant that exhibits hemiparasitic behavior, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the roots of other plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can be difficult to detect due to its cryptic appearance. Botanically, it is of interest for its unique adaptations to parasitic growth and its role in ecological interactions."
