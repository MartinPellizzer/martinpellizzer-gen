    "intro": "Fritillaria tubaeformis, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive cap-like structure at the top. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a cluster of showy blooms in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
