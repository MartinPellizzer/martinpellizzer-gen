    "intro": "Fidelia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stems rising from water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still water. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the aquatic environment. Fidelia is valued not only for its beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance in various traditions."
