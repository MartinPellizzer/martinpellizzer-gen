    "intro": "Ferocactus polyancistrus, commonly known as the Mexican lion's tail, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
