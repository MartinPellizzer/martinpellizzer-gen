    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
