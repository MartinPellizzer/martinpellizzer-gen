It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its unique morphology includes a woody stem with a fibrous covering and a root system adapted to coastal and saline environments. Freycinetia pectinata plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and practical uses."
