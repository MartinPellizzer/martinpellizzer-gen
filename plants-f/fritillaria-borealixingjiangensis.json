    "intro": "Fritillaria borealixingjiangensis, commonly known as the Xingjiang fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Xinjiang, China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust, underground bulb that serves as its storage organ. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
