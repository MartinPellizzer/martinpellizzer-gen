    "intro": "Fraxinus pubinervis, commonly known as the pubescent ash, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The leaves are covered with fine, soft hairs, especially on the underside, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
