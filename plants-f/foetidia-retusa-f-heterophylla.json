    "intro": "Foetidia retusa f. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf foetidia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually appearing in umbels, and are often white or pale green in color. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological variation and limited distribution."
