    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. villosa-vivipara, commonly known as the hairy viviparous sheep's fescue, is a variant of the sheep's fescue species. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of hairy foliage. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. One of its notable features is the production of viviparous shoots, which are capable of rooting and growing into new plants. Its botanical structure includes narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences."
