    "intro": "Forsteronia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf forsteria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardening, particularly in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Forsteronia ovalifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid environments and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
