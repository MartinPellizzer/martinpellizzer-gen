It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically dark purple when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
