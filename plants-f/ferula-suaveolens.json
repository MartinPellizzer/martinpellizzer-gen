    "intro": "Ferula suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet fennel or Indian licorice, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, aromatic leaves that emit a mild licorice scent. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in summer, followed by cylindrical, aromatic seed pods. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula suaveolens is also valued in perfumery for its essential oils, which are extracted from its leaves and flowers."
