    "intro": "Froelichia lanata var. laciniata, commonly known as the lace-leaf froelichia, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy habitats and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Its showy, red or orange flowers appear in late spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Due to its unique foliage and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for wetland restoration projects."
