    "intro": "Festuca pseudovina f. subpruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose false bentgrass, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage. It features a dense, mat-forming structure with slender, cylindrical stems that often lie close to the ground. The leaves are narrow, slightly folded, and covered with a fine, powdery bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. This variant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
