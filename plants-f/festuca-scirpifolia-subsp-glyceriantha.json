The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
