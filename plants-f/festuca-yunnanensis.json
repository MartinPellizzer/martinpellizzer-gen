    "intro": "Festuca yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, two-keeled spikelets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Festuca yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
