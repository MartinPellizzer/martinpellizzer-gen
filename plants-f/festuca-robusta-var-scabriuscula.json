    "intro": "Festuca robusta var. scabriuscula, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or grassy slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers in the summer. Festuca robusta var. scabriuscula is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
