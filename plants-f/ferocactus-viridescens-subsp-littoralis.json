    "intro": "Ferocactus viridescens subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal cholla, is a spineless cactus native to the coastal regions of Baja California. It has a cylindrical stem that is typically green and covered with small, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to arid and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained sandy soils. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and high wind exposure."
