    "intro": "Floerkea palustris, commonly known as the marsh floerkea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds and streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered flowers with showy violet petals. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Floerkea palustris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
