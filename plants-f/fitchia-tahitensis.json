    "intro": "Fitchia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian fitchia, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a tall, slender stem and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
