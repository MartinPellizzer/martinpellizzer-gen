    "intro": "Filago maurorum, commonly known as the Mediterranean filago, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Filago maurorum is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in various arid environments."
