    "intro": "Fevillea amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped blossoms that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of the rainforest. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fevillea amazonica plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
