    "intro": "Frailea odieri, commonly known as the Odier's stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, adapted for water storage. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. Frailea odieri is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
