    "intro": "Festuca capillaris, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. It is also used in horticulture for its tolerance to shade and its low maintenance requirements."
