    "intro": "Fallopia pterocarpa, commonly known as the giant knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its tall, stout stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface and produces small, clustered white flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions. Fallopia pterocarpa is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadside areas."
