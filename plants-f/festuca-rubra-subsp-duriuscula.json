    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. duriuscula, commonly known as rough red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a reddish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open, rocky habitats such as alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
