    "intro": "Festuca albifolia var. tschujensis, commonly known as the Tschujan silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white to pale blue flowers, adding a delicate aesthetic to its natural habitat. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
