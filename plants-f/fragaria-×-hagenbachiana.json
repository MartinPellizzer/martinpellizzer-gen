    "intro": "Fragaria \u00d7 hagenbachiana, commonly known as the Hagenbach strawberry, is a hybrid strawberry species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, bright red berries that are typically smaller than those of the common garden strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers with five petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a suitable candidate for cultivation in temperate climates. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes grown for its edible fruits."
