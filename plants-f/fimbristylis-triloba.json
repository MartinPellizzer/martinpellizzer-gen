    "intro": "Fimbristylis triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed sedge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it often forms dense mats in wetland habitats. Fimbristylis triloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
