    "intro": "Festuca poiformis, commonly known as the mountain festuca, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize rocky slopes effectively. Festuca poiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
