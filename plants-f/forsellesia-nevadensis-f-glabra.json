    "intro": "Forsellesia nevadensis f. glabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf forsellesia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, attracting specific pollinators. Its growth habit is often shrub-like, with multiple stems and compact foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
