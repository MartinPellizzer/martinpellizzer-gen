    "intro": "Ficus microcarpa, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a large tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aerial roots that hang from its branches and eventually reach the ground, forming a network of support structures. The tree has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various animals. Ficus microcarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
