    "intro": "Festuca scariosa, commonly known as scarious fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaf blades with a distinctive whitish or silver-gray sheath, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in cold, dry, and often nutrient-poor environments, making it a common component of tundra and rocky habitats. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh conditions, and it plays a role in preventing erosion in alpine ecosystems. Festuca scariosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings due to its hardiness and unique foliage."
