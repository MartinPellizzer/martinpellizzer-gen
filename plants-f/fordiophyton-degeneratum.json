    "intro": "Fordiophyton degeneratum, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and often scale-like, adapted for underwater growth. Fordiophyton degeneratum is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrient uptake."
