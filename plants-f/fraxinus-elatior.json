    "intro": "Fraxinus elatior, commonly known as the white ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, characterized by its compound leaves with 9 to 15 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The white ash is valued for its strong, flexible wood, which has been used historically for tool handles and sports equipment."
