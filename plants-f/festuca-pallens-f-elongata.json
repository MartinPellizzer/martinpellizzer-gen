    "intro": "Festuca pallens f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated meadow grass, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. It typically forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are slightly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are often pale green to brown in color. It is well adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This variant is often used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes due to its fine texture and ornamental appeal."
