    "intro": "Festuca breviaristata, commonly known as the short-awned fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca breviaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and fine-textured foliage."
