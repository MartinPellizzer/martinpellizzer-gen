    "intro": "Filix-mas cristata, commonly known as the crested fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled fronds that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, finger-like segments that are often curled or twisted. Filix-mas cristata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
