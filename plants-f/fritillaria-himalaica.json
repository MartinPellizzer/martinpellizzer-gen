    "intro": "Fritillaria himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with a distinctive purple or brown border. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its bulbous structure stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
