It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the genus Fumaria. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
