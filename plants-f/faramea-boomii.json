    "intro": "Faramea boomii, commonly known as the African evergreen holly, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glossy evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Faramea boomii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded garden settings."
