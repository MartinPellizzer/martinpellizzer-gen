    "intro": "Frailea albicolumnaris, commonly known as the White Columned Cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a small, solitary cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, lateral branches. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is prized for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
