    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash or oblique ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive, elongated, ovate leaves that are typically darker green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
