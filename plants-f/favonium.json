    "intro": "Favonium, commonly known as the \"flower of the moon,\" is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features slender, silver-green leaves and produces small, pale lavender flowers that bloom at night. The plant is known for its unique ability to absorb moonlight, which enhances its nocturnal blooming cycle. Favonium is highly valued in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties. Due to its fragile nature and limited habitat, it is considered an endangered species."
