It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, arranged in a crown-like cluster atop a tall stem. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive, often fragrant aroma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
