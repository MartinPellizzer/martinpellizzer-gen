    "intro": "Fragariastrum isauricum, commonly known as the Isaurian strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, red, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to true strawberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
