    "intro": "Fouquieria campanulata, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, candle-like stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, scale-like, and adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Fouquieria campanulata is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
