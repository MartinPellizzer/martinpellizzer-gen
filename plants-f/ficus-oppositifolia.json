    "intro": "Ficus oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves are paired on either side of the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. Its leaves are typically thick and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Ficus oppositifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
