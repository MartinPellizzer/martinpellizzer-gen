    "intro": "Ficaria verna f. pumila, commonly known as the winter cabbage or snowdrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, waxy leaves that help it survive cold temperatures. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
