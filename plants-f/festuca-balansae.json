    "intro": "Festuca balansae, commonly known as Balansae fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca balansae is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
