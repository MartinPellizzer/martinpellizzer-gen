    "intro": "Freyeria, commonly known as the nightshade or wild tobacco, is a genus of flowering plants in the Solanaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. Freyeria species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or purple, followed by berries that contain the seeds. They are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Some species of Freyeria are used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
