    "intro": "Fedtschenkoa hispida, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often with a violet or purple tinge. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Fedtschenkoa hispida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
