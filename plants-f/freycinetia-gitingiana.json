    "intro": "Freycinetia gitingiana, commonly known as the Gitingian screw pine, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique visual appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often found at the ends of its long, slender stems. Its woody, fibrous stem is covered with a thick layer of bark, and it thrives in humid, coastal environments. Freycinetia gitingiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional practices in its native regions."
