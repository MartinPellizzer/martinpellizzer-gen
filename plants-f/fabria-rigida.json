    "intro": "Fabria rigida, commonly known as the rigid fabria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features upright, rigid stems that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in hot, dry climates. Fabria rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
