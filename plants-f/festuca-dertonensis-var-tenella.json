    "intro": "Festuca dertonensis var. tenella, commonly known as the dwarf tussock grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
