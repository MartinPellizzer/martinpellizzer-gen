    "intro": "Festuca extremiorientalis, commonly known as Siberian grass or the Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps prevent soil erosion. Festuca extremiorientalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
