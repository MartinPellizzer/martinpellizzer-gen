    "intro": "Forsteronia rotundiuscula, commonly known as the round-leaved forsteria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Forsteronia rotundiuscula thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
