    "intro": "Festuca pectinella, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, awned flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca pectinella is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
