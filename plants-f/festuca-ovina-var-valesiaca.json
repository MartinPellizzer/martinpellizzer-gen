    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. valesiaca, commonly known as the alpine sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact stature and resilience make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and grazing in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
