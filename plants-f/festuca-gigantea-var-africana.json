    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. africana, commonly known as African bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and striking blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely arranged. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
