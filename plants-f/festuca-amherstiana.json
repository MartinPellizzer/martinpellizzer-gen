    "intro": "Festuca amherstiana, commonly known as Amherst's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. Festuca amherstiana is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
