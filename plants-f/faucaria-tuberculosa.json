    "intro": "Faucaria tuberculosa, commonly known as the ice plant or snow plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
