    "intro": "Ficus pyriformis var. ischnopoda, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Ficus pyriformis. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, green figs that turn red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant. Its adaptability to various light conditions makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
