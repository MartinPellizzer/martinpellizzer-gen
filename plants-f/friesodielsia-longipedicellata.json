    "intro": "Friesodielsia longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-pedicelled sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and distinctive floral structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a glossy surface. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
