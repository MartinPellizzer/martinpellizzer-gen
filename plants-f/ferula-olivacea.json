    "intro": "Ferula olivacea, commonly known as the green ferula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Ferula olivacea thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
