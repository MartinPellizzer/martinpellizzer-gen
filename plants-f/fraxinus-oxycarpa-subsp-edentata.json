    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa subsp. edentata, commonly known as the smooth-fruited ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The flowers are small and green, appearing in catkin-like clusters, and the fruit is a samara with a smooth, winged structure. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in floodplain forests. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
