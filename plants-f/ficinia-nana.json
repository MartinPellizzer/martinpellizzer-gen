    "intro": "Ficinia nana, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact growth habit with fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Ficinia nana is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
