    "intro": "Flickingeria bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly contrasting colors on its petals and sepals, typically featuring a white or pale pink base with a deep purple or violet overlay. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
