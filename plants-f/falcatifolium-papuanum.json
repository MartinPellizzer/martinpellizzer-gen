    "intro": "Falcatifolium papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan sword fern, is a species of fern native to the highland regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its elongated, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that makes it a notable ornamental plant."
