    "intro": "Festuca ochroleuca subsp. bigorronensis, commonly known as the Bigorre bentgrass, is a grass species native to the Pyrenees region of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually pale green to yellowish in color. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
