    "intro": "Franca revoluta, commonly known as the velvet leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Franca revoluta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
