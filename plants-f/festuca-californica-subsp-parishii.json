It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable plant in native landscaping and conservation efforts."
