    "intro": "Fritillaria minima, commonly known as the dwarf crown imperial, is a small bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a short stem that supports its showy inflorescence. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
