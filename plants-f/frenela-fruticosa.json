    "intro": "Frenela fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal shrub or sea holly, is a hardy, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Frenela fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
