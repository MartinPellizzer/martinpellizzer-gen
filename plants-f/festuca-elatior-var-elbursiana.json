    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. elbursiana, commonly known as Elburs mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color, with small, grass-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
