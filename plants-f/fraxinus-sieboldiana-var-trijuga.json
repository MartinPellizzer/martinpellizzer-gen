It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
