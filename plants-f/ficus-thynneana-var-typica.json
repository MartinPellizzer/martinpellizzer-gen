    "intro": "Ficus thynneana var. typica, commonly known as the Malagasy fig, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are often clustered together. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
