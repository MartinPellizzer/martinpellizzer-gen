It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a dark green upper surface. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
