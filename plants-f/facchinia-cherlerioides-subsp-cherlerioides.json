    "intro": "Facchinia cherlerioides subsp. cherlerioides, commonly known as the Chilean snowbell, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and the plant is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It is also noted for its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
