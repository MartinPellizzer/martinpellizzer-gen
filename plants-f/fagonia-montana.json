    "intro": "Fagonia montana, commonly known as the mountain fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a feature common in xerophytic plants adapted to hot, dry environments. Fagonia montana is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-water conditions."
