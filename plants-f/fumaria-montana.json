    "intro": "Fumaria montana, commonly known as the common fumitory, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. Fumaria montana thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its historical use in traditional medicine has contributed to its recognition in herbal practices."
