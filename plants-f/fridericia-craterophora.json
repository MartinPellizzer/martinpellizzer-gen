    "intro": "Fridericia craterophora, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically unique species within its range."
