    "intro": "Festuca rivas-martinezii, commonly known as Rivas' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
