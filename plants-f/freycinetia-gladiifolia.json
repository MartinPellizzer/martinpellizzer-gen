    "intro": "Freycinetia gladiifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its long, slender, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Freycinetia gladiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
