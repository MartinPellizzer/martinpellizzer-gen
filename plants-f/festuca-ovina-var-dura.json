    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. dura, commonly known as hard sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are resistant to drought and heavy grazing. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters, with small, pale florets that are often overlooked. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and low maintenance requirements. Its botanical resilience makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration and landscaping in challenging environments."
