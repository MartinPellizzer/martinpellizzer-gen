    "intro": "Ficus dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus dodsonii is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
