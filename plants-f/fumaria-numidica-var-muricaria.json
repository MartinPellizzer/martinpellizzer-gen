    "intro": "Fumaria numidica var. muricaria, commonly known as the rock fumitory, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across dry landscapes. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions."
