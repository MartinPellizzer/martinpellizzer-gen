    "intro": "Fraxinus glabra, commonly known as the smooth ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in drooping clusters in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
