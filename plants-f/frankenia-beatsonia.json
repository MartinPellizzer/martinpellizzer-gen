    "intro": "Frankenia beatsonia, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Frankenia beatsonia is well-suited to coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
