    "intro": "Festuca sauvagei, commonly known as wild fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its natural surroundings. Festuca sauvagei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various ecological settings."
