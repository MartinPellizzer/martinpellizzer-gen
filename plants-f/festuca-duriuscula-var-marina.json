    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. marina, commonly known as sea fescue, is a coastal grass species adapted to saline and sandy environments. It exhibits dense, low-growing vegetation with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is frequently found along shorelines and dunes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. The plant plays a key role in stabilizing dune structures and preventing erosion."
