    "intro": "Fagraea fraserensis, commonly known as the Fraser's fagraea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
