    "intro": "Floscopa hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy floscopa, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems helps to reduce water loss, making it well adapted to its environment."
