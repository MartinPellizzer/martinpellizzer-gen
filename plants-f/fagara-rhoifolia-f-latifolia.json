    "intro": "Fagara rhoifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf fagara, is a variant of the species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
