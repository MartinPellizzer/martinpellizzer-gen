    "intro": "Ficus involuta, commonly known as the curled-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often curled leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are typically consumed by birds and other animals. Ficus involuta thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance."
