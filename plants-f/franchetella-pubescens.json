    "intro": "Franchetella pubescens, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly coating of tiny, branched filaments called rhizines, which help it adhere to surfaces. The thallus is typically bright yellow to orange in color, with a firm, leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. This lichen is notable for its ability to tolerate pollution and is commonly used as an indicator of environmental conditions."
