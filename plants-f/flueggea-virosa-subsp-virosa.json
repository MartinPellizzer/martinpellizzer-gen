    "intro": "Flueggea virosa subsp. virosa, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, exhibiting drought tolerance and heat resistance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
