    "intro": "Facheiroa squamosa var. polygona, commonly known as the coastal thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, grey-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal areas, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Its growth habit is typically low and mat-like, forming dense clusters that help stabilize dunes. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments."
