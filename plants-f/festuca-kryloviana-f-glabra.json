    "intro": "Festuca kryloviana f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadow fescue, is a variant of the meadow fescue species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense spike of spikelets, which are covered in small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
