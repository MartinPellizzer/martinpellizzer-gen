    "intro": "Fagonia glutinosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. The flowers are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
