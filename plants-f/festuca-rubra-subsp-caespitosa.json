    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. caespitosa, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, dark green foliage that is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry, sunny conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps it form cohesive turf-like patches, enhancing its use in gardens and restoration projects."
