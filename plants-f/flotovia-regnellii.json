    "intro": "Flotovia regnellii, commonly known as the floating bellflower, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its buoyant, bell-shaped flowers that float on the water surface. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is native to certain regions of South America. The plant has long, slender stems that support its showy, violet-colored blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and submerged, aiding in photosynthesis while allowing the plant to remain afloat. Flotovia regnellii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
