    "intro": "Faramea vasquezii, commonly known as the Vasquez's faramea, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Faramea vasquezii is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
