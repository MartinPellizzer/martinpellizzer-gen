    "intro": "Fornicaria, commonly known as the \"lizard's tail,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its unique, creeping growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that often appear at the ends of its stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Fornicaria species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
