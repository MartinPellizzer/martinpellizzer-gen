    "intro": "Festuca sinensis, commonly known as Chinese meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant features slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Festuca sinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
