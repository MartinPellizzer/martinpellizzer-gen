    "intro": "Freziera atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic freziera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
