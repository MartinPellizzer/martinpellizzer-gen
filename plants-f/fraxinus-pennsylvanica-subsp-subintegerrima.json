    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica subsp. subintegerrima, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more rounded leaf margins compared to other Fraxinus species."
