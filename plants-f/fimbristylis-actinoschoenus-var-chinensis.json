It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale brown flowers. It thrives in wetland environments, including marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
