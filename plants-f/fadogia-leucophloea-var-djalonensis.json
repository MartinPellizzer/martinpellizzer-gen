    "intro": "Fadogia leucophloea var. djalonensis, commonly known as the West African rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the rocky habitats of West Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring showy, spurred flowers that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in association with limestone or granite substrates. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
