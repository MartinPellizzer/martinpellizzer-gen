    "intro": "Fraxinus schiedei, commonly known as the Schiedea ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
