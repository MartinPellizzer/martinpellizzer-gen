    "intro": "Fimbristylis nutans var. rhyticarya, commonly known as the prostrate spike-rush, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various microorganisms."
