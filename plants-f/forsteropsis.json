    "intro": "Forsteropsis, commonly known as the false kudzuvine, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It comprises several species that are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a pinnate structure, and produce small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. They also bear pods that contain seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind or animals. Forsteropsis species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
