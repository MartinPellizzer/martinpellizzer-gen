    "intro": "Fritillaria heterophylla, commonly known as the Turk's Cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant once established. Fritillaria heterophylla is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
