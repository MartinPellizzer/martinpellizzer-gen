    "intro": "Festuca kolymensis, commonly known as Kolyma fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and fine, dark green foliage, adapted to survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca kolymensis thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its resilience to extreme temperatures makes it an important component of high-latitude ecosystems."
