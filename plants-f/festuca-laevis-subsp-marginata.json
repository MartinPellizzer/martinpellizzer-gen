    "intro": "Festuca laevis subsp. marginata, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
