    "intro": "Furcatella rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is often found growing in crevices or on rocky outcrops. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Furcatella rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
