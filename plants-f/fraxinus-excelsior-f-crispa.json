    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. crispa, commonly known as the crisped ash, is a unique form of the common ash, characterized by its distinctive crinkled or wavy leaf margins. This cultivar exhibits a compact growth habit with a broad, rounded crown, making it suitable for smaller gardens or urban landscapes. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a slightly serrated edge that adds visual interest. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. While it is less hardy than the common ash, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
