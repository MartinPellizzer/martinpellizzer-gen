    "intro": "Ficus pulvinifera, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a species of fig tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and aerial roots that hang from its branches. The plant has a distinctive trunk with a swollen base, and its leaves are typically large and glossy. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible figs that are an important food source for many animals. The banyan tree is also known for its ability to grow into a massive tree with a wide, umbrella-like shape."
