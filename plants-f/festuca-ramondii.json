    "intro": "Festuca ramondii, commonly known as Ramond's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca ramondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
