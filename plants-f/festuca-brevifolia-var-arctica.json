    "intro": "Festuca brevifolia var. arctica, commonly known as Arctic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. Its compact growth form helps it withstand harsh weather conditions and prevents freezing damage. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic animals."
