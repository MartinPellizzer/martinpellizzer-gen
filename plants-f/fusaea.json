    "intro": "Fusaea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western Pacific. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that enclose the small, violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in saline environments, making it well adapted to coastal ecosystems. Its unique morphology includes narrow, linear leaves and a short, upright stem. Fusaea is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and resilience to harsh coastal conditions."
