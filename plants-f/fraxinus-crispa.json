    "intro": "Fraxinus crispa, commonly known as the curly ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a narrow, upright form. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind."
