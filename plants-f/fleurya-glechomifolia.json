    "intro": "Fleurya glechomifolia, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments. It features a prostrate growth habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in moist habitats. Small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
