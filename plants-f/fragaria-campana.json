    "intro": "Fragaria campana, commonly known as the bell strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically bell-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces edible berries that are smaller and less sweet than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along woodland edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
