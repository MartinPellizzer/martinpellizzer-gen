    "intro": "Festuca elatior var. uechtritziana, commonly known as the Uechtritzian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, alpine climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
