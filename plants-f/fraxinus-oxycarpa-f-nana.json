It features small, ovate leaves that are typically 2\u20134 inches long, with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by samaras with narrow wings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian habitats."
