    "intro": "Fumana ericoides f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the alpine heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is a common component of high-altitude vegetation."
