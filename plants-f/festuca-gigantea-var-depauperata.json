    "intro": "Festuca gigantea var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It features fine, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
