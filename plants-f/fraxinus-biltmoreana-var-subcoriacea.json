    "intro": "Fraxinus biltmoreana var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the Biltmore ash, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native environment."
