    "intro": "Fuirena mahouxii, commonly known as the Mahoux's fuirena, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
