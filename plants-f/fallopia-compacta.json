    "intro": "Fallopia compacta, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its stout, hollow stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. Fallopia compacta is known for its aggressive growth and has become an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
