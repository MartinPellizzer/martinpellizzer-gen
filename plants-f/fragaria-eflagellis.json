    "intro": "Fragaria eflagellis, commonly known as the wandering strawberry, is a rare and elusive species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, followed by tiny, edible berries that are highly sought after by foragers. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
