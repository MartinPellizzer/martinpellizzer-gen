    "intro": "Frondaria colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian fern, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a rare and fascinating subject of study in botany."
