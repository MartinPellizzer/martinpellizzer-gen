    "intro": "Festuca richardsonii var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
