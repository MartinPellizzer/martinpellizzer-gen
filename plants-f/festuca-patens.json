    "intro": "Festuca patens, commonly known as the creeping fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Festuca patens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
