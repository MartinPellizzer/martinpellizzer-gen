    "intro": "Ficus tawaensis, commonly known as the Tawae fig, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
