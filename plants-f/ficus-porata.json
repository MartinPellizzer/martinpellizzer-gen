    "intro": "Ficus porata, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, inedible fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. Ficus porata is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Its adaptability and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
