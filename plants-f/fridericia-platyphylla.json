    "intro": "Fridericia platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved fridericia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in terminal umbels, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases seeds through dehiscence. Fridericia platyphylla is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
