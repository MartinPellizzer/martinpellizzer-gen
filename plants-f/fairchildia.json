    "intro": "Fairchildia, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble those of hibiscus, though they are not closely related. Fairchildia species typically have palmate leaves and produce capsules as their fruit. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
