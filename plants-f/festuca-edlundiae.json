    "intro": "Festuca edlundiae, commonly known as Edlund's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Festuca edlundiae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
