    "intro": "Froelichia interrupta var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf froelichia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine, though its medicinal properties are not well-documented. The species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
