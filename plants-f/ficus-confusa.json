    "intro": "Ficus confusa, commonly known as the confusion fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered fruits known as syconia, which are enclosed within a fleshy, greenish-yellow receptacle. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus confusa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
