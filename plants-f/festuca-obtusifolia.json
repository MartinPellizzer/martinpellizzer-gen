    "intro": "Festuca obtusifolia, commonly known as bluntleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a bluntly rounded tip. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Festuca obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
