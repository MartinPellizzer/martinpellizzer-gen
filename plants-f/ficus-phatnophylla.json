    "intro": "Ficus phatnophylla, commonly known as the giant ficus or giant shield leaf, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Ficus phatnophylla is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
