    "intro": "Fragaria vulgaris var. muricata, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits composed of numerous achenes. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit, while not as large as cultivated strawberries, is prized for its intense flavor and is often used in culinary applications."
