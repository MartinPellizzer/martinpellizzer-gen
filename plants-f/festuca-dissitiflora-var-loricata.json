    "intro": "Festuca dissitiflora var. loricata, commonly known as the woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
