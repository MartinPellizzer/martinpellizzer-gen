    "intro": "Festuca pacifica var. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal meadow fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with soft, hairy structures along the edges. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal meadows and dunes. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of pale green to blue-gray flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca pacifica var. ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
