    "intro": "Fritillaria coccinea, commonly known as the Turk's Cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive cap-like structure at the top. The plant features a fibrous root system and thick, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients for growth. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating. Fritillaria coccinea thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
