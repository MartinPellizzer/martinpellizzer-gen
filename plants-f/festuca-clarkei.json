    "intro": "Festuca clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed florets. Festuca clarkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
