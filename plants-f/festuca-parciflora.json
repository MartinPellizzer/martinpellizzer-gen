    "intro": "Festuca parciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Festuca parciflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
