    "intro": "Festuca elatior subvar. pseudololiacea, commonly known as the tall fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, slender blades that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant typically forms dense clumps and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. The leaves are usually bluish-green in color, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the spring."
