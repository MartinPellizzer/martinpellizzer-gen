    "intro": "Falkia oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf falkia, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Falkia oblonga thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique foliage and modest flowering make it an attractive addition to native plant collections."
