    "intro": "Feijoa obovata, commonly known as the rough feijoa, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, obovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits with a unique, sweet-tart flavor. The fruit's skin is thin and delicate, while the pulp is juicy and contains numerous small, inedible seeds. Feijoa obovata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit."
