    "intro": "Festuca richardii, commonly known as Richard's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca richardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
