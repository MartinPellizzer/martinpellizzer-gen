    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. sulcata, commonly known as the Sulcate Sheep's Fescue, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly arranged along the stems, with small, two-lobed flowers that are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
