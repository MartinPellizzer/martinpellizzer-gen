    "intro": "Feuilleea granulosa, commonly known as the granular leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its textured, waxy foliage. Native to arid regions, it has adapted to thrive in low-water environments with its succulent leaves. The plant's leaves are covered in small, granular protrusions that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Feuilleea granulosa is valued in horticulture for its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance."
