    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pauciflora, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and dark green foliage, which remains lush throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in lawns and pastures due to its drought tolerance and hardiness. Festuca rubra var. pauciflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
