    "intro": "Fibrocentrum, commonly known as the fibrous-centred plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its fibrous root system, which plays a crucial role in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization. The plant typically features compound leaves with a serrated edge, and its flowers are usually small and clustered in racemes. Fibrocentrum species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to their adaptability, they are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
