    "intro": "Festuca cratericola, commonly known as the crater grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Festuca cratericola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
