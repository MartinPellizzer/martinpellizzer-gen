    "intro": "Ficus pisifera, commonly known as the large-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, turning reddish-brown when ripe. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus pisifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to indoor environments."
