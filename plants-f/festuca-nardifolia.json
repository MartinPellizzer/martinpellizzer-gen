    "intro": "Festuca nardifolia, commonly known as slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca nardifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy, low-maintenance nature."
