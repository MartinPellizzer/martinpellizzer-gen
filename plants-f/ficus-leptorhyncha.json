    "intro": "Ficus leptorhyncha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are encased in a green, fleshy syconium. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus leptorhyncha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
