It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and low-nutrient conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. Festuca sibirica subvar. karoi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in difficult conditions."
