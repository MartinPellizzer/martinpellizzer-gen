    "intro": "Festuca costata var. fascicularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
