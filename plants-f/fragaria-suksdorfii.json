    "intro": "Fragaria suksdorfii, commonly known as the Saksdorf strawberry, is a rare and ancient species of wild strawberry native to Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and produces small, red, edible fruits. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
