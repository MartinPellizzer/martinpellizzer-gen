    "intro": "Fordia, commonly known as the bottlebrush bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its unique, dense clusters of small, red or pink flowers that resemble bottle brushes. The plant typically grows as a shrub, with slender, often thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves. Fordia species are native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan, and are valued for their ornamental appeal. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
