    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica proles tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted beech, is a rare variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its unique, twisted growth pattern, which gives it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. This plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. The twisted form is a result of genetic mutations and environmental factors, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
