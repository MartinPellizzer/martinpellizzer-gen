    "intro": "Ferula divaricata, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the hollow, tubular stem, which contains a milky sap that was historically used as a substitute for cow's milk. Ferula divaricata is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
