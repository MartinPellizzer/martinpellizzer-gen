    "intro": "Filipendula denudata, commonly known as the naked false waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks and in damp meadows. The plant features slender, leafy stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, blooming in late spring to early summer. Filipendula denudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
