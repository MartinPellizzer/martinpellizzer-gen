    "intro": "Filipendula angustiloba var. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly meadow sweet, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological gardening."
