    "intro": "Fleischmannia obscurifolia, commonly known as the dark-leaf fleischmannia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is often used in landscaping in desert regions."
