    "intro": "Ficinia echinata, commonly known as the spiny sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Ficinia echinata is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care once established."
