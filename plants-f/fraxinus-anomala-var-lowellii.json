It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by samaras that are dispersed by wind. This plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
