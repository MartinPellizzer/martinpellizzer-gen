    "intro": "Festuca pratensis, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca pratensis is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its forage quality and ecological benefits. Its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions makes it a common component of grassland ecosystems."
