It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Fendleria species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Their unique morphology and striking floral displays make them popular among cactus enthusiasts and botanists alike."
