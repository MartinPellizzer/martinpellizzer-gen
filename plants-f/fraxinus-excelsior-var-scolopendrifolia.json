    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. scolopendrifolia, commonly known as the Scolopendrifolia ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are broader and more deeply lobed compared to the typical ash, often featuring a unique, almost fern-like appearance. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, shaded woodland environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
