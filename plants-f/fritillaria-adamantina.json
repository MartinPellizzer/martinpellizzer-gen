    "intro": "Fritillaria adamantina, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow, often with contrasting dark veins. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed around the base. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid conditions, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Fritillaria adamantina is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
