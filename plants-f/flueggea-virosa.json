    "intro": "Flueggea virosa, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Flueggea virosa is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging desert conditions."
