    "intro": "Ferocactus santa-maria, commonly known as the Santa Maria barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and bats. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Ferocactus santa-maria is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
