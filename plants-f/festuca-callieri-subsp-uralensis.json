    "intro": "Festuca callieri subsp. uralensis, commonly known as Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
