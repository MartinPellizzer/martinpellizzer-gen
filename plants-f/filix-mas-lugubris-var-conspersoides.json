It is characterized by its drooping fronds that give it a melancholic appearance, hence its scientific name. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves with a distinctive, finely textured surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
