    "intro": "Forficaria, commonly known as the common buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. They typically grow in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Forficaria species are often found in areas with rich, loamy soil and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
