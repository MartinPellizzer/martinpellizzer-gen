    "intro": "Filago arvensis subsp. lagopus, commonly known as the common filago, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by wind."
