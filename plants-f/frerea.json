    "intro": "Frerea, commonly known as the \"butterfly flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm climates. They are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Frerea species typically have opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
