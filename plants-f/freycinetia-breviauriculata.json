    "intro": "Freycinetia breviauriculata, commonly known as the short-auriculate freycinetia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compact spikes, which are typically borne on the leaf sheaths. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a common sight in moist, shaded habitats. Freycinetia breviauriculata is often used in traditional practices and is valued for its ornamental and practical uses in local communities."
