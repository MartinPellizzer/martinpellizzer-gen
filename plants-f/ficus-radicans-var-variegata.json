    "intro": "Ficus radicans var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Fig Vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and striking variegated leaves that feature white and yellow markings. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to climb or cascade makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelves. Regular pruning helps maintain its shape and encourages new growth."
