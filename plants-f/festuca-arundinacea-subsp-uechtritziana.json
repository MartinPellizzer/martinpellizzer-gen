    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea subsp. uechtritziana, commonly known as the Uechtritzian meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This subspecies is often found in moist meadows and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
