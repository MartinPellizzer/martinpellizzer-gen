    "intro": "Fichtea, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces small, purple-coned seed cones that mature to release winged seeds. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Fichtea is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
