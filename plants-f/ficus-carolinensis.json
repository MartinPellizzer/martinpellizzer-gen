    "intro": "Ficus carolinensis, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elongated leaves that are arranged in a distinctive whorled pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are typically not eaten by humans. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indoor environments with moderate light and consistent care. Ficus carolinensis is also known for its adaptability and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
