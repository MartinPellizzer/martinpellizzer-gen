    "intro": "Ferocactus emoryi, commonly known as Emory's barrel cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a solitary, columnar cactus with a ribbed, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. Its spines are typically yellow to brown and are arranged in clusters along the ribs. Ferocactus emoryi is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
