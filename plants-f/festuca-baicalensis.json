    "intro": "Festuca baicalensis, commonly known as Baikal fescue, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, temperate environments. Festuca baicalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal landscapes."
