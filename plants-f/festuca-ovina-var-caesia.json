    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. caesia, commonly known as blue sheep fescue, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking blue-gray foliage, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense mats that prevent erosion. Festuca ovina var. caesia is also relatively drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established."
