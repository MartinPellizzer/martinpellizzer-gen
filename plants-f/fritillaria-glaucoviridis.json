    "intro": "Fritillaria glaucoviridis, commonly known as the greenish fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale green to yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or brown rim. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive, globe-shaped bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
