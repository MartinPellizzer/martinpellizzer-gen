    "intro": "Fagonia harpago f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple fagonia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cactaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and clusters of small, vibrant purple flowers. Native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant's leaves are reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh habitat. Its unique morphology and coloration make it a distinctive and visually appealing species within the cactus family."
