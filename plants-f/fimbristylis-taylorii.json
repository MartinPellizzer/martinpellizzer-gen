It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. Native to Australia, it thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, and its reproductive structures are typical of the sedge family.
