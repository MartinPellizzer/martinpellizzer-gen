    "intro": "Festuca muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
