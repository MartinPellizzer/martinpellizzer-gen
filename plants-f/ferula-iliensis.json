It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and feathery leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often harvested for their aromatic compounds, which have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
