    "intro": "Fritillaria meleagroides var. plena, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features tall, upright stems that bear clusters of vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The flowers are typically arranged in a crown-like pattern at the top of the stem, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are broad, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette at the base. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun exposure."
