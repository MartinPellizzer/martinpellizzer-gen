    "intro": "Fosterella gracilis, commonly known as the slender fosterella, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Fosterella gracilis is well adapted to sandy soils and salty air, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
