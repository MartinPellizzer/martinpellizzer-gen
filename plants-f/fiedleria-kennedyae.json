It is native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its deep green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers. It is notable for its unique floral structure, which features prominent stamens and a specialized corolla. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fiedleria kennedyae is considered an endangered species."
