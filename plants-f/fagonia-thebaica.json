    "intro": "Fagonia thebaica, commonly known as the desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and prickly leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, round fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
