    "intro": "Friedlandia serpyllifolia, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
