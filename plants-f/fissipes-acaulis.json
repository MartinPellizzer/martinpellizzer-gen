    "intro": "Fissipes acaulis, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Fissipes acaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and barren habitats."
