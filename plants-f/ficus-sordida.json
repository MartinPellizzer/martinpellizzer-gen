    "intro": "Ficus sordida, commonly known as the sordid fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces both male and female flowers, which are typically concealed within the foliage. Ficus sordida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
