    "intro": "Ficus pilosa, commonly known as the hairy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in spherical, woody syconia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens due to its ornamental value. The leaves are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
