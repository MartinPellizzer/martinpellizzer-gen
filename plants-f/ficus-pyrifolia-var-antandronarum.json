    "intro": "Ficus pyrifolia var. antandronarum, commonly known as the Antandronara fig, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and broad, ovate leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
