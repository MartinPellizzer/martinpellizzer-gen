    "intro": "Filix-mas villosa, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and spore-producing structures. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features long, serrated fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Filix-mas villosa reproduces via spores rather than seeds, a typical trait of ferns."
