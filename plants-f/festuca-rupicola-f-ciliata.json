    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliate rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often adorned with ciliate (fringed) margins. This variety thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
