    "intro": "Ficus uncinata var. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy fig or woolly fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is characterized by its dense, soft pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. This plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is less prominent than in other ficus species."
