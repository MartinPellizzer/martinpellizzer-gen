    "intro": "Ficus scaberrima, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically sour and not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Ficus scaberrima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
