    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. berlandieriana, commonly known as the Mexican ash, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
