    "intro": "Frankenia pallida, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Frankenia pallida is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
