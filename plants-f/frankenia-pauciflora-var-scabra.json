It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Frankenia pauciflora var. scabra is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
