    "intro": "Festuca caldasii, commonly known as the Caldas mountaingrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Festuca caldasii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
