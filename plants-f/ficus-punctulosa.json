    "intro": "Ficus punctulosa, commonly known as the punctuated fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are often dotted with small, raised bumps or spots, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may turn reddish or yellowish depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus punctulosa is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
