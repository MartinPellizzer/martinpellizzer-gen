It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Fidelia trivialis is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in waste areas, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a common but often overlooked member of the Apiaceae family."
