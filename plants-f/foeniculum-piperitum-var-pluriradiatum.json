    "intro": "Foeniculum piperitum var. pluriradiatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved fennel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds, similar to those of common fennel, are also used in cooking and traditional medicine. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the standard fennel, making it a distinctive ornamental and edible plant."
