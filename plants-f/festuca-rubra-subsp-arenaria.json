    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sandy fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, heathlands, and open woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is drought-tolerant and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor habitats."
