    "intro": "Fagonia charoides, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spine-tipped fruits. Its leaves are usually small, thick, and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Fagonia charoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
