    "intro": "Funckia alpina, commonly known as the alpine funckia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Funckia alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a symbol of the rugged beauty of mountain ecosystems."
