    "intro": "Festuca sibirica var. deasyi, commonly known as Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender leaves, and dense, compact inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting tolerance to frost, drought, and poor soil conditions. Its fine texture and silver-gray foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and erosion control. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, forming a low, mat-like structure that spreads slowly through rhizomes."
