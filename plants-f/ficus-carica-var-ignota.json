    "intro": "Ficus carica var. ignota, commonly known as the Persian fig, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common fig. It is characterized by its distinctive, often reddish or bronze-colored leaves, which set it apart from typical fig varieties. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically smaller and less sweet than those of the common fig. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes grown for landscape purposes."
