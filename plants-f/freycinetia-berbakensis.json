    "intro": "Freycinetia berbakensis, commonly known as the Berbak palm, is a species of palm native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
