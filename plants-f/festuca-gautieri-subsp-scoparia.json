    "intro": "Festuca gautieri subsp. scoparia, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
