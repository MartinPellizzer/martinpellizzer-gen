    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. monophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leaved ash, is a rare variant of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its entire, smooth-edged leaves, which distinguish it from the typical serrated leaves of the species. This form is a natural variation that occurs in certain regions of Europe. The plant retains the general morphology of Fraxinus excelsior, including its slender, branching habit and winged samaras. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream valleys."
