    "intro": "Fradinia geslini, commonly known as the Geslin's fradinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with intricate patterns resembling veins. The plant has slender, erect stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
