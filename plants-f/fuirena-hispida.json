    "intro": "Fuirena hispida, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Fuirena hispida is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
