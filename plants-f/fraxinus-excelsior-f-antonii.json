It is characterized by its unique, finely serrated leaves that are often lighter in color compared to the typical ash. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils and is native to parts of Europe. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
