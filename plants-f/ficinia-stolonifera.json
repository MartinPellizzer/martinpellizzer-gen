    "intro": "Ficinia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping spikerush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Australia. It forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes and spread across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It thrives in water-saturated soils and is often found in swamps, ponds, and along riverbanks. Its ability to colonize disturbed or wetland areas makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
