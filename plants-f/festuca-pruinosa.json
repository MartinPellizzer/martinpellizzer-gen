    "intro": "Festuca pruinosa, commonly known as the silvery fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which results from a waxy coating on the leaves, known as pruina. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form dense, low-growing turf. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
