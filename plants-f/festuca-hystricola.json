    "intro": "Festuca hystricola, commonly known as the hedgehog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, spiky seed heads that resemble the bristles of a hedgehog. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that adds visual interest to the landscape. Festuca hystricola is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
