It is characterized by its smooth, dark green, waxy leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, spherical fruits that mature to a reddish color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal."
