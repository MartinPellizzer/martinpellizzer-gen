    "intro": "Ficus gigantea, commonly known as the giant ficus, is a large evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
