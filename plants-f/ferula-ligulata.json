    "intro": "Ferula ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cylindrical inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Ferula ligulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, sharing some structural similarities with other members of the carrot family."
