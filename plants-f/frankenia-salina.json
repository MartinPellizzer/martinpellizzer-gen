    "intro": "Frankenia salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration, a key adaptation to its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Frankenia salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
