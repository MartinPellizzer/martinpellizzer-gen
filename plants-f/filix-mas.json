    "intro": "Filix-mas, commonly known as the common horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in rough, silica-rich nodes. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stem, which are typically found in clusters. Filix-mas thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it one of the oldest living seedless plants."
