It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of other ficus species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically consumed when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
