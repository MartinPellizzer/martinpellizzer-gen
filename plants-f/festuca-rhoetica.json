    "intro": "Festuca rhoetica, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca rhoetica is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in high-altitude areas."
