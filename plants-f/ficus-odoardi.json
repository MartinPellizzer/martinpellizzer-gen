    "intro": "Ficus odoardi, commonly known as the Odoardi fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into edible figs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus odoardi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
