    "intro": "Frankenia chilensis var. aspera, commonly known as the Chilean frankenia, is a succulent shrub native to coastal regions of South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
