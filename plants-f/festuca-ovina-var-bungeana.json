    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. bungeana, commonly known as Bunge's bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, forming a low-growing sod. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
