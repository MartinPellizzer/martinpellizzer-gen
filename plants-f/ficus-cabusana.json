    "intro": "Ficus cabusana, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, greenish-white fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
