    "intro": "Festuca rupicola var. sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging leaf arrangement and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets during the flowering season. Festuca rupicola var. sulcata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in rocky habitats."
