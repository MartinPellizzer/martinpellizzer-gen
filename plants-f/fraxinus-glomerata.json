    "intro": "Fraxinus glomerata, commonly known as the clustered ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, winged fruits. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Fraxinus glomerata is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
