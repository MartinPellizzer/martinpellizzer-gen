It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant has a robust bulb that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive harsh winter conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental value. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
