It features showy, white, waxy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Fordia incredibilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
