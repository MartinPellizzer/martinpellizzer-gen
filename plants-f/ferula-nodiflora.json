    "intro": "Ferula nodiflora, commonly known as the nodding ferula, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Ferula nodiflora is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
