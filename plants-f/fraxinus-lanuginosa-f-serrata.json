    "intro": "Fraxinus lanuginosa f. serrata, commonly known as the silky ash or serrated ash, is a variant of the silky ash tree native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically opposite, with serrated margins that contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
