    "intro": "Fimbristylis salbundia subsp. pentaptera, commonly known as the five-winged sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its subspecies distinction is characterized by the presence of five prominent, wing-like structures on the fruiting spikes. The botanical features of this plant make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
