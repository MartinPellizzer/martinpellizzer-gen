    "intro": "Fagopyrum capillatum, commonly known as common buckwheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with slender lobes, and its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows. Buckwheat is also cultivated for its seeds, which are used in food and as a cover crop in agriculture."
