    "intro": "Frankenia peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along shorelines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the dry season. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and succulent, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Frankenia peruviana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
