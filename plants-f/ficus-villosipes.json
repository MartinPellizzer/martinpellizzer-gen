    "intro": "Ficus villosipes, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus villosipes is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities."
