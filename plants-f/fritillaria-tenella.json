    "intro": "Fritillaria tenella, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Middle East. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red, arranged in a tall, erect spike. The plant has a distinctive crown-like cluster of leaves at the base, which gives it its common name. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Fritillaria tenella is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is adapted to well-drained, sunny environments."
