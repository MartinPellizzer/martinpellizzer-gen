    "intro": "Ficinia undosa, commonly known as the wavy-leaf sedum, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique leaf patterns and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
