    "intro": "Festuca croatica, commonly known as Croatian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in temperate climates and its tolerance to moderate grazing. Festuca croatica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
