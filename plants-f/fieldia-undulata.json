    "intro": "Fieldia undulata, commonly known as the wavy fieldia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It typically grows in wet meadows and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance, giving it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish, and it blooms in the summer months. Fieldia undulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
