    "intro": "Filix patens, commonly known as the walking fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically green and slightly curled at the tips. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or near water sources. Filix patens is known for its ability to regenerate from its rhizomes, making it a resilient and hardy species."
