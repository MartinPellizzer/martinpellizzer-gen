    "intro": "Festuca jenissejensis, commonly known as the Yenisei fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, temperate to subarctic environments. Festuca jenissejensis is often found in tundra and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
