    "intro": "Festuca kurtziana, commonly known as Kurtz\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
