    "intro": "Frangula capreifolia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, and it has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in various conditions. The bark and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
