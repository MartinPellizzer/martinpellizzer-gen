It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Festuca cochabambana is noted for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for researchers studying plant adaptation to extreme environments."
