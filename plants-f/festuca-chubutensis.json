    "intro": "Festuca chubutensis, commonly known as Chubut grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca chubutensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
