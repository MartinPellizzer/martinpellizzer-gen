    "intro": "Fendlera rupicola var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's fendlera, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
