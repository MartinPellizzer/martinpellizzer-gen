    "intro": "Ficus dodonaeifolia, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, cascading leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits. Ficus dodonaeifolia is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
