    "intro": "Festuca nemorum, commonly known as wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its habitat. Festuca nemorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
