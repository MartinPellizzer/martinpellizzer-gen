    "intro": "Fimbriella psycodes, commonly known as the lace lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a distinctive, finely branched thallus with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant's symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria enables it to photosynthesize and thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
