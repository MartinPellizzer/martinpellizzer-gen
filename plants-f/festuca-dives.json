    "intro": "Festuca dives, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca dives thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
