    "intro": "Fritillaria tulipifolia, commonly known as the tulip-shaped fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with contrasting markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves at the base, which die back after flowering. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and can remain dormant for several years. Fritillaria tulipifolia is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
