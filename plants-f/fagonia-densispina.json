    "intro": "Fagonia densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching structure and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Fagonia densispina is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
