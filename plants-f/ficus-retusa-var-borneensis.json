    "intro": "Ficus retusa var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Borneo and is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves that are often variegated with white or light green markings. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and air-purifying qualities. The Bornean fig is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
