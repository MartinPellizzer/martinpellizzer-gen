    "intro": "Fimbristylis biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered flatsedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown, arranged in spikelets along the stem. Fimbristylis biflora thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, and is often found in association with water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
