It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and scrublands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact size and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
