    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue to pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
