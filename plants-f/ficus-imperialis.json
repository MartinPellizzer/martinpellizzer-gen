    "intro": "Ficus imperialis, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a unique species of fig tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, thorn-covered branches and a dense, umbrella-like canopy. The plant has a thick, gnarled trunk and produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible figs. Its leaves are large, glossy, and often have a waxy texture. Ficus imperialis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
