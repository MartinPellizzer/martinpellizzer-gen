    "intro": "Fragaria elatior var. muricata, commonly known as the rough strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, with a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodland areas. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other strawberries but is valued for its wild, natural habitat and unique botanical features."
