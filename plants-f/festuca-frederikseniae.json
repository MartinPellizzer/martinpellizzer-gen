    "intro": "Festuca frederikseniae, commonly known as Frederiksen's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
