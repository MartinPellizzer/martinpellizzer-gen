    "intro": "Floscopa aquatica, commonly known as water fleabane, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Floscopa aquatica plays an important role in supporting aquatic insect populations and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
