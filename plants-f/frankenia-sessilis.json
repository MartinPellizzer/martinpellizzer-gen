    "intro": "Frankenia sessilis, commonly known as the seaside sandmat, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically opposite and oval in shape. Frankenia sessilis is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periods of drought. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is considered an important component of maritime ecosystems."
