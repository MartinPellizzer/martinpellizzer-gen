    "intro": "Festuca tolucensis, commonly known as Tolucan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Festuca tolucensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
