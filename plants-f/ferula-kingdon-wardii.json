    "intro": "Ferula kingdon-wardii, commonly known as the Kashmir ferula, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and distinctive aromatic foliage. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Pakistan and India, this plant thrives in cool, temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and its taproot is often harvested for its medicinal and aromatic properties. The plant is known for its strong, pungent odor, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, Ferula kingdon-wardii is considered a species of conservation concern."
