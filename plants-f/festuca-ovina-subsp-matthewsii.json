    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. matthewsii, commonly known as the Matthews' sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
