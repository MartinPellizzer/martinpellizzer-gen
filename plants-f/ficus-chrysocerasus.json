    "intro": "Ficus chrysocerasus, commonly known as the golden fig or the silver leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a striking silver or white variegation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically harvested when they turn a deep red or purple. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
