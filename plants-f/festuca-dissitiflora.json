    "intro": "Festuca dissitiflora, commonly known as the scattered-flower fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically produces pale green to blue-green foliage, which is often covered with short, dense hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Festuca dissitiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and resilience."
