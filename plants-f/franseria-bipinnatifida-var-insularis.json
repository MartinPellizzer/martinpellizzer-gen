    "intro": "Franseria bipinnatifida var. insularis, commonly known as the island franseria, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatifid leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
