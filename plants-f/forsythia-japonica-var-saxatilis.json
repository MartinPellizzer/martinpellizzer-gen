    "intro": "Forsythia japonica var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock forsythia, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
