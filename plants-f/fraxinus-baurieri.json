    "intro": "Fraxinus baurieri, commonly known as the Baur's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
