    "intro": "Ficus abutilifolia, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or broadly ovate. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its roots are fibrous and can be used to make rubber, which is why it is also called the rubber fig. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
