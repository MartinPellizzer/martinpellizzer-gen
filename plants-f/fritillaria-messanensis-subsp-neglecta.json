    "intro": "Fritillaria messanensis subsp. neglecta, commonly known as the Messina fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves, and its bulbs are adapted for storage and survival in Mediterranean climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
