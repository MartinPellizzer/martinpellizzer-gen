    "intro": "Ficus katendei, commonly known as the Katende fig, is a rare and unusual species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of East Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it has a distinctive, sprawling growth habit. Ficus katendei is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
