It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing mats and thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and alpine habitats."
