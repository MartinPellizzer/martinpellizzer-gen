It features delicate, arching fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Fenerivia richardiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in indoor and garden settings."
