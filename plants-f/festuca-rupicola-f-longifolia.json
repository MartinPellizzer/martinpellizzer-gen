    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved rock fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and preference for rocky or gravelly soils. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that produce narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelets, each bearing a single floret. This variety is notable for its elongated leaf blades, which distinguish it from other forms of Festuca rupicola. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil."
