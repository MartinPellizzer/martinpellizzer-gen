    "intro": "Fargesia brevissima, commonly known as the dwarf arrow bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming shrub native to China. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-green leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and cold hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes."
