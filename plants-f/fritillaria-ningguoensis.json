    "intro": "Fritillaria ningguoensis, commonly known as the Ningguo fritillary, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its bulbs are an important part of its life cycle, storing nutrients for growth and flowering. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
