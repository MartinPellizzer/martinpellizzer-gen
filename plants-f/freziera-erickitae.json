    "intro": "Freziera erickitae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre freziera, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in open habitats such as slopes and meadows. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring or early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Freziera erickitae is relatively rare and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
