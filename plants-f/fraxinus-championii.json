    "intro": "Fraxinus championii, commonly known as the Arizona ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The Arizona ash is often used in urban landscapes due to its tolerance of poor soil conditions and drought resistance."
