    "intro": "Ficus macrothyrsa, commonly known as the large-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus macrothyrsa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
