    "intro": "Ferula polyantha, commonly known as the Persian cowpea or Persian buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small buttercups. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Ferula polyantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments."
