It is a small to medium-sized tree with thick, waxy leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in small, round inflorescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its foliage is widely used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
