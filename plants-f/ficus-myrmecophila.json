    "intro": "Ficus myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is notable for its unique relationship with certain ant species, which reside in the specialized hollow stems called domatia. These domatia provide shelter for the ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. Ficus myrmecophila is also characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
