    "intro": "Festuca oraria var. halmyris, commonly known as the coastal meadow fescue, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It is a hardy perennial that plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its flowering spikes produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often overlooked but are important for pollinators in its habitat."
