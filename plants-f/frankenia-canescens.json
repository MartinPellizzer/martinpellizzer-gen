    "intro": "Frankenia canescens, commonly known as coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Frankenia canescens plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
