    "intro": "Festuca poliens, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca poliens thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its dense growth helps prevent soil erosion and provides habitat for various small organisms."
