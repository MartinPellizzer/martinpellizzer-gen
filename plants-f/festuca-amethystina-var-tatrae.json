    "intro": "Festuca amethystina var. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Tatra Mountains of Central Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat. Festuca amethystina var. tatrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
