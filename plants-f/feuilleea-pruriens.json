    "intro": "Feuilleea pruriens, commonly known as the itching leaf plant, is a tropical species characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, irritating hairs. These hairs release a mild allergenic compound, causing a tingling or itching sensation upon contact with the skin. The plant is native to humid regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Despite its irritating effects, the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
