    "intro": "Fagus gunnii, commonly known as the silver fagot, is a species of beech native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white underside on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, moist climates and thrives in temperate forests. Its bark is smooth and gray, while its leaves are oval-shaped and have a serrated edge. Fagus gunnii produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
