    "intro": "Ficus hispida var. incana, commonly known as the velvetleaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in groups. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
