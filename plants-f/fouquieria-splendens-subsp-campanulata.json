    "intro": "Fouquieria splendens subsp. campanulata, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, willow-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, are pollinated primarily by bees and hummingbirds. The species is also notable for its ability to produce a profuse display of blooms during the spring and early summer."
