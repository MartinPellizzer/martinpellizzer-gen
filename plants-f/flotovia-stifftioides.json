    "intro": "Flotovia stifftioides, commonly known as the Stifft's flotovia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
