    "intro": "Fokienia hodginsii var. kawaii, commonly known as the Japanese incense cedar, is a rare and ornamental conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by spherical cones that release lightweight seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited natural range and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and aromatic foliage."
