    "intro": "Festuca dahurica subsp. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
