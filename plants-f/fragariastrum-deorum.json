    "intro": "Fragariastrum deorum, commonly known as the celestial strawberry, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the early spring, followed by edible berries that are said to have a unique, slightly sweet and floral flavor. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found growing in shaded, rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and the difficulty of cultivating it, Fragariastrum deorum is highly valued in botanical circles."
