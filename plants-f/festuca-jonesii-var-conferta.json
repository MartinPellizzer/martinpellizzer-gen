    "intro": "Festuca jonesii var. conferta, commonly known as the dense fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage that forms a thick mat. The plant typically produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
