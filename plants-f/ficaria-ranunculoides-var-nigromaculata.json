    "intro": "Ficaria ranunculoides var. nigromaculata, commonly known as the black-spotted ficaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green leaves that have distinctive black or dark purple spots. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short stems above the leaf rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a decorative ground cover."
