    "intro": "Ficus incompta, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is well-known for its adaptability to indoor environments. Ficus incompta is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions."
