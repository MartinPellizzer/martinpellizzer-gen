It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish-white fruits. It is well adapted to humid environments and thrives in partial to full shade. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
