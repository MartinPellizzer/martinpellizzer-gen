    "intro": "Fagonia arabica var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, dry fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments with poor soil conditions. Its unique features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
