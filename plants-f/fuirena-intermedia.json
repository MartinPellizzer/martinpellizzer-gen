    "intro": "Fuirena intermedia, commonly known as the common fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Fuirena intermedia plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
