    "intro": "Frankenia hamata, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. Frankenia hamata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes."
