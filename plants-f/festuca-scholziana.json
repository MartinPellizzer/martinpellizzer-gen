    "intro": "Festuca scholziana, commonly known as Scholz's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, slender leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Festuca scholziana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
