    "intro": "Fuchsia magellanica var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered fuchsia, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant, showy blooms and compact growth habit."
