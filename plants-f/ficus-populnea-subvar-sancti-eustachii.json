    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. sancti-eustachii, commonly known as the San Eustachio fig, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the Ficus genus. It is native to specific regions of Mexico, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. Its small, clustered flowers are followed by edible figs that are often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often sought after by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
