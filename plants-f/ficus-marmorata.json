    "intro": "Ficus marmorata, commonly known as the marble fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive mottled or marbled pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits, which are typically not consumed by humans but are important for wildlife. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus marmorata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
