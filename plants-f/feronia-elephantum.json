    "intro": "Feronia elephantum, commonly known as the elephant apple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by large, green, football-shaped fruits. The fruit's outer layer, or epicarp, is thick and fibrous, while the inner pulp is juicy and edible. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and ornamental value."
