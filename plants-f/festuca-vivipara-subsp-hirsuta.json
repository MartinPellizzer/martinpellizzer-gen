    "intro": "Festuca vivipara subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy festuca, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its subspecies name. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in wet environments and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian zones."
