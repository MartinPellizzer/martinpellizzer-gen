The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Festuca olgae is characterized by its resilience to harsh climatic conditions, making it a hardy component of high-altitude ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
