    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. pubiflora, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pink to reddish flowers, which are often pubescent. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice in horticulture and landscaping."
