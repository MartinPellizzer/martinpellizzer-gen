    "intro": "Foeniculum officinale subsp. dulce, commonly known as sweet fennel, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its feathery, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant produces small, oval fruits known as seeds, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. Sweet fennel thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like anethole, contribute to its distinctive licorice-like aroma."
