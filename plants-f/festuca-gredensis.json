    "intro": "Festuca gredensis, commonly known as Gredensko grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca gredensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
