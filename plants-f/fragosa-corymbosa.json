    "intro": "Fragosa corymbosa, commonly known as the fragrant clustered shrub, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible. Fragosa corymbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
