    "intro": "Fragariastrum nivalis, commonly known as the snow strawberry, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are often compared to strawberries in taste, though they are much smaller. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
