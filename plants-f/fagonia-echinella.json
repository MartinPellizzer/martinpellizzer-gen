    "intro": "Fagonia echinella, commonly known as the spiny fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and spiny, woody stems, which provide it with a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its leaves are typically small and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Fagonia echinella plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for various desert wildlife."
