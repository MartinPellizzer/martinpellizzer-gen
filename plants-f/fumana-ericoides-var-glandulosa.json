    "intro": "Fumana ericoides var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular heath, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves are a distinctive botanical feature, aiding in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
