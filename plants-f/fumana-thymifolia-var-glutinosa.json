It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and compact growth habit."
