    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. fraterculae, commonly known as the \"Rook's grass,\" is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, wiry leaves that are often reddish in color, especially at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and grassy slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
