    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. barbulata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and drought resistance. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a low-maintenance ornamental grass."
