    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a striking aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features showy, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, making it both ornamental and ecologically significant."
