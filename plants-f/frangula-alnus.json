    "intro": "Frangula alnus, commonly known as common senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, ribbed fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. Frangula alnus is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the use of its bark in traditional remedies."
