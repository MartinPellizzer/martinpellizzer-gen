    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. lagascae, commonly known as the Lagasca fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and along the edges of bogs. Due to its low nutritional value, it is considered less desirable for forage but plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
