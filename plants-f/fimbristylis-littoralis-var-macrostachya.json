    "intro": "Fimbristylis littoralis var. macrostachya, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or brackish environments such as estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its inflorescence is characterized by elongated, hairy bracts that give it its species name \"macrostachya,\" meaning \"long-stalked.\" This plant plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
