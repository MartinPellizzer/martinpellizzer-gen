    "intro": "Ferocactus macrodiscus var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in prominent, white to pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
