    "intro": "Fleischmannia coibensis, commonly known as the Coiba fleischmannia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Fleischmannia coibensis is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in dry tropical forests or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
