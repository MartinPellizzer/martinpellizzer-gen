    "intro": "Fumaria microstachys, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a hairy, upright stem that often branches near the base, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of tubers that store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive through winter. Fumaria microstachys is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
