    "intro": "Fimbristylis multistriata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist habitats, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib, and its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, three-ranked spikelets. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by small, three-angled berries. Fimbristylis multistriata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
