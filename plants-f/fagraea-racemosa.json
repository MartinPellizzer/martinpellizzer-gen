    "intro": "Fagraea racemosa, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but have astringent properties. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy inflorescences. Fagraea racemosa is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
