    "intro": "Ficus sageretina, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called syconia. Its fruit, a small, greenish fig, is edible but typically not consumed by humans due to its mild bitterness. Ficus sageretina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
