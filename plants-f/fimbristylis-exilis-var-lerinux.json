    "intro": "Fimbristylis exilis var. lerinux, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to brownish flowers. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like inflorescence and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its preference for moist environments, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
