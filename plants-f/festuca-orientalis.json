    "intro": "Festuca orientalis, commonly known as oriental fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca orientalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a ground cover in gardens."
