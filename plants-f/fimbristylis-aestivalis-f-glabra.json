It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its three-ranked leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded soils, such as marshes, swamps, and along waterways. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the species.
