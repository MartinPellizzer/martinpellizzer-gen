    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. tenella, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
