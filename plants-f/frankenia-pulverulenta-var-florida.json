    "intro": "Frankenia pulverulenta var. florida, commonly known as Florida beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, coastal environments. The plant features small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to salt spray and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats."
