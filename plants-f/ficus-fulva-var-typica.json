    "intro": "Ficus fulva var. typica, commonly known as the variegated rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with yellow or white variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its health. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular houseplant, though it can be toxic if ingested by pets or humans."
