    "intro": "Festuca balcanica, commonly known as Balkan fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Festuca balcanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements."
