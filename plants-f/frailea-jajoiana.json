    "intro": "Frailea jajoiana, commonly known as the Jajoan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a powdery coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in spring. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in rock gardens."
