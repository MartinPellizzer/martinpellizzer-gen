    "intro": "Festuca blepharophora, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils, where it forms dense mats that help prevent erosion. Its slender, spike-like inflorescence bears small, wind-pollinated flowers, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness. Festuca blepharophora is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in harsh environments."
