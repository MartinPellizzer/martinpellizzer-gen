    "intro": "Frankenia bucharica subsp. bucharica, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia bucharica subsp. bucharica is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes."
