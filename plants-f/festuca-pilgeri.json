    "intro": "Festuca pilgeri, commonly known as Pilger's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-ranked flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Festuca pilgeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
