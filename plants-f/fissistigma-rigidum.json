    "intro": "Fissistigma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid flat-leafed lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its flat, leaf-like thallus that is usually greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, with the algal partner providing photosynthetic capability. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments. Fissistigma rigidum is often found in temperate regions and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
