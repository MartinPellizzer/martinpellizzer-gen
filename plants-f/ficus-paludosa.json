    "intro": "Ficus paludosa, commonly known as the swamp fig, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in swampy areas, often near waterlogged soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. Ficus paludosa plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
