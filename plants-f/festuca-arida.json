    "intro": "Festuca arida, commonly known as the desert grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are small and spike-like, typically appearing in late spring or early summer. Festuca arida is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
