    "intro": "Fascicularia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered star grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in gardens. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is native to South America and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun conditions. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
