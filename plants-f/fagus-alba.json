    "intro": "Fagus alba, commonly known as the European white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its seeds are encased in spiky, triangular husks and are dispersed by wind. Fagus alba plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
