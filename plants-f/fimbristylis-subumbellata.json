It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on wind pollination. Fimbristylis subumbellata is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions."
