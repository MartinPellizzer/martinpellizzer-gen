    "intro": "Fagelia alata, commonly known as the winged maple-leaf, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are often divided into five to seven lobes, with the outer lobes featuring prominent, wing-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Fagelia alata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
