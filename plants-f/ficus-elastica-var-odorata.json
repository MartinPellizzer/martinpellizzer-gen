    "intro": "Ficus elastica var. odorata, commonly known as the variegated rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically variegated with cream and green patterns, providing a striking visual appeal. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its rubbery texture is due to the high latex content in its stems and leaves. While it is not known for producing a strong fragrance, it is appreciated for its aesthetic value and air-purifying qualities."
