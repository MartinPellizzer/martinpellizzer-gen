    "intro": "Fragaria collina dumetorum, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible, red, berry-like fruits that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and can survive in harsh climates."
