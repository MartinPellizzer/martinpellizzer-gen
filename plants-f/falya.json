    "intro": "Falya, commonly known as the desert rose, is a striking flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often resembling roses. Falya is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and resilience make it both an ornamental and ecological asset in dry landscapes."
