    "intro": "Fagraea racemosa subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Fagraea racemosa."
