    "intro": "Flueggea acidothamnus, commonly known as sour thorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
