    "intro": "Festuca glaucispicula, commonly known as bluegrass or glaucous spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Festuca glaucispicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
