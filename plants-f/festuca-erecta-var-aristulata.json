    "intro": "Festuca erecta var. aristulata, commonly known as the aristate bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear purple to pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native landscapes and restoration projects. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and seasonal color changes."
