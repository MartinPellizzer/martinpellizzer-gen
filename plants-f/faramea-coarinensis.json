It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruits are small, capsule-like structures containing numerous seeds. Faramea coarinensis is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, arrowhead shape."
