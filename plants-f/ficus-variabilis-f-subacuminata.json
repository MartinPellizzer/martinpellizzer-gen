    "intro": "Ficus variabilis f. subacuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a variant of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Ficus variabilis. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in syconia, which are specialized fruiting structures. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
