    "intro": "Ficus conraui, commonly known as the Conraui fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus conraui is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
