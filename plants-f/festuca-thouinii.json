    "intro": "Festuca thouinii, commonly known as the Thouin's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca thouinii is often found in rocky soils and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
