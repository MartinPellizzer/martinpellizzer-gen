    "intro": "Fimbristylis sunilii, commonly known as the Sunil's sedge, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes grass-like plants known for their fibrous roots and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
