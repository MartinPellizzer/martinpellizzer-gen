    "intro": "Festuca nevadensis, commonly known as Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly the Sierra Nevada range. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca nevadensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
