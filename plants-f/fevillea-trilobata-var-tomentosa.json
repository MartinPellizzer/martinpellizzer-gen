    "intro": "Fevillea trilobata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly fevillea, is a unique species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing minute, black seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value lies in its unusual foliage, making it a sought-after plant for specialized gardens and collections."
