    "intro": "Festuca anomala, commonly known as mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca anomala is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
