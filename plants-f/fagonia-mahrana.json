    "intro": "Fagonia mahrana, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and other succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in harsh environments. Fagonia mahrana is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
