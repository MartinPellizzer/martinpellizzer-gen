    "intro": "Festuca cajamarcae, commonly known as the Cajamarca fescue, is a perennial grass native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Festuca cajamarcae plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
