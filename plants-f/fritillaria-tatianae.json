    "intro": "Fritillaria tatianae, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
