    "intro": "Fumaria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal fumitory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Fumaria littoralis thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shore, adapting to the harsh conditions of coastal habitats."
