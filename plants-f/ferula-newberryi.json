    "intro": "Ferula newberryi, commonly known as Newberry's giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of other members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family, and its roots can grow quite deep, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Ferula newberryi is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
