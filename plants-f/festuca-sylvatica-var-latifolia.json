    "intro": "Festuca sylvatica var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically broader than those of other Festuca species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance plant."
