    "intro": "Festuca geniculata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and often forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive mats. Festuca geniculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
