    "intro": "Festuca sumapana, commonly known as the Andean fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blueish flowers, which are typical of the Festuca genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca sumapana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
