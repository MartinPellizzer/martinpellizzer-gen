    "intro": "Festuca subspicata var. griffithiana, commonly known as Griffith's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces compact spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
