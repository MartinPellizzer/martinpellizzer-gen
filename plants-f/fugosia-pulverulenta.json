It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal partner, forming a symbiotic relationship. This lichen typically grows on moist, shaded surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks. Its name, \"powdered lichen,\" refers to its fine, powdery appearance when broken down. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
