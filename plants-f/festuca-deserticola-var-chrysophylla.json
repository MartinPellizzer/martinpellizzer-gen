    "intro": "Festuca deserticola var. chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden leaf desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which sets it apart from other Festuca species. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, with a dense, compact growth form that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
