    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. laevis, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hairless blades and compact growth habit, making it a desirable ornamental and turfgrass. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing mats with a bluish-green coloration due to its waxy leaf surfaces. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and grasslands. Festuca ovina subsp. laevis is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
