    "intro": "Ficus atricha, commonly known as the black ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by fig-like fruits. Ficus atricha is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
