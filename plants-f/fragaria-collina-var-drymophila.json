    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. drymophila, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It produces small, edible fruits that are typically red in color and have a sweet, fragrant flavor. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it has white flowers that bloom in early summer. This variant is notable for its hardiness and ability to grow in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
