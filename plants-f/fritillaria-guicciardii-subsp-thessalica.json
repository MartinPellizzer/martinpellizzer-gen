    "intro": "Fritillaria guicciardii subsp. thessalica, commonly known as the Thessalian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with intricate patterns. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
