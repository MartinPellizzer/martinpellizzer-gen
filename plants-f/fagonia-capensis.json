    "intro": "Fagonia capensis, commonly known as the Cape fagonia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its prickly stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Fagonia capensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
