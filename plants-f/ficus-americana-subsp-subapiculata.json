    "intro": "Ficus americana subsp. subapiculata, commonly known as the curly willow fig, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous leaves that often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically enclosed in a fleshy, spiky structure called a syconium. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its adaptability makes it suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments."
