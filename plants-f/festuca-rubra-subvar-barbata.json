    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. barbata, commonly known as the hairy red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and the presence of hairy structures along the leaf blades, giving it its common name. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny grasslands and rocky areas. It is a low-growing plant that forms dense mats, making it useful for erosion control and ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to withstand various environmental conditions."
