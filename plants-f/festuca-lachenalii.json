    "intro": "Festuca lachenalii, commonly known as the Lachenal's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically silver-gray in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca lachenalii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
