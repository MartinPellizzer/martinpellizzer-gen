    "intro": "Freziera grisebachii, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help insulate the plant from cold temperatures. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
