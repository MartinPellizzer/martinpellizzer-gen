    "intro": "Faramea rivularis, commonly known as the river faramea, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often accompanied by elliptical, leathery leaves. Faramea rivularis is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees or other structures. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in its native habitats."
