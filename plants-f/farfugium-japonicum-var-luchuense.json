    "intro": "Farfugium japonicum var. luchuense, commonly known as the Luchu Islands golden crown, is a perennial herb native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It features a rosette of large, broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in the summer, arranged in a distinctive crown-like inflorescence at the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long blooming period."
