    "intro": "Farsetia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Farsetia obliqua thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
