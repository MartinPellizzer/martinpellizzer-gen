    "intro": "Festuca amplissima var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and erosion control capabilities. Festuca amplissima var. elliptica is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for many garden environments."
