    "intro": "Fragaria sundaica, commonly known as the Sunda strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with a low-growing habit, featuring trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces edible, red berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but are typically smaller. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Fragaria genus."
