    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. austinii, commonly known as the Austinite ash, is a variant of the green ash tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and landscape use."
