    "intro": "Forsteria, commonly known as the snowbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the southern hemisphere, particularly in South Africa and Australia. The plants are characterized by their bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Forsteria species typically have evergreen foliage and are valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens. They prefer well-drained soils and are often cultivated for their delicate, fragrant blooms."
