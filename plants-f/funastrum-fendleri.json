    "intro": "Funastrum fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. Funastrum fendleri is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in desert landscapes."
