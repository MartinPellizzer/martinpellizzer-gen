    "intro": "Festuca fallax var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense turf make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
