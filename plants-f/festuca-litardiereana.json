It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca litardiereana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
