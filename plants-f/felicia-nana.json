    "intro": "Felicia nana, commonly known as dwarf blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
