    "intro": "Flavicoma capitata, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. Flavicoma capitata is adapted to thrive in moist, sunny environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
