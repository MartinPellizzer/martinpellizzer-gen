    "intro": "Fragaria alba, commonly known as the white strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine hairs. The fruit, though not as flavorful as cultivated strawberries, is edible and contains a mild, sweet taste. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
