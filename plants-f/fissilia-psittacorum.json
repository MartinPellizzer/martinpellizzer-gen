    "intro": "Fissilia psittacorum, commonly known as the parrot's beak, is a rare and striking member of the Lepidocarpaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its unique, twisted, and often brightly colored stems that resemble a parrot's beak. The plant is native to the Canary Islands and thrives in rocky, coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cone-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
