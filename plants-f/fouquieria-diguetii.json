    "intro": "Fouquieria diguetii, commonly known as the Mexican ocotillo, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are often covered in small, spiny leaves, which are shed during periods of drought. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its deep root system allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Fouquieria diguetii is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
