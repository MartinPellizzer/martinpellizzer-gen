    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. sandomiriensis, commonly known as the Sandomirian sheep's fescue, is a grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and pastures. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. This form is distinguished by its compact growth and unique morphological features compared to the typical *Festuca ovina*."
