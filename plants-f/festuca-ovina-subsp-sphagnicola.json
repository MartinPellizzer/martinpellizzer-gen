    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. sphagnicola, commonly known as the bog fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in acidic, moist environments such as bogs, fens, and wet meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
