    "intro": "Festuca pumila var. negrii, commonly known as the alpine meadow fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover in shaded or dry areas."
