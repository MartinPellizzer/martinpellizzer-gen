    "intro": "Ficinia brevifolia f. atrocastanea, commonly known as the dark-barked form of the narrow-leaved figs, is a horticultural variant of the species Ficinia brevifolia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which distinguishes it from the typical green-barked form. The plant is a shrub with small, narrow leaves that are usually dark green in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
