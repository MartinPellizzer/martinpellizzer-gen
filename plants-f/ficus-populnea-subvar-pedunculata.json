    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. pedunculata, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical plant characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive heart-shaped leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are typically yellow or red when mature. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance for partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its rapid growth and adaptability have also made it a common invasive species in certain regions."
