    "intro": "Fraxinus texensis, commonly known as the Texas ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 feet and has a broad, open crown with smooth, gray bark. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits that disperse seeds by wind. The tree is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
