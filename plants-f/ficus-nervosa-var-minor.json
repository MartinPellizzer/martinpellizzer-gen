    "intro": "Ficus nervosa var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Ficus nervosa. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits that are often consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation in warm climates."
