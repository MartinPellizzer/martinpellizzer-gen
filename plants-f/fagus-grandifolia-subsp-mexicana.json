    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia subsp. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican beech, is a variant of the American beech found in the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers and samaras as its reproductive structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in cloud forests. The subspecies exhibits some morphological differences from the typical Fagus grandifolia, including smaller leaves and a more compact growth habit."
