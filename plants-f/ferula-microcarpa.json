    "intro": "Ferula microcarpa, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a loose panicle, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic, resinous roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Ferula microcarpa is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting local biodiversity."
