It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats. Its common name reflects the dramatic way its flowers appear to \"dissolve\" into the landscape as they age."
