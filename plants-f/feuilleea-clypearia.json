It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that are often a vibrant shade of green, with a subtle golden hue along the edges. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Native to arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
