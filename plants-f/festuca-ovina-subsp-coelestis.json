    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. coelestis, commonly known as bluegrass or sky blue grass, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
