    "intro": "Fernandoa abbreviata, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
