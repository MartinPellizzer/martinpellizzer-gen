    "intro": "Flickingeria bicostata, commonly known as the two-costed fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into two distinct costae, or midribs, giving it its scientific name. The plant prefers shady, humid environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees in forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Flickingeria bicostata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
