    "intro": "Ferula jaeschkeana subsp. taenioloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ferula, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive grayish-blue hue. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
