    "intro": "Forbesina, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and have a glossy appearance. Forbesina species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and they are often clustered in inflorescences. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
