    "intro": "Festuca lanatifolia, commonly known as the woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca lanatifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
