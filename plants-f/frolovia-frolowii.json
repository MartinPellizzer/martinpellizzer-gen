    "intro": "Frolovia frolowii, commonly known as the silverleaf frostbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its silvery, velvety leaves and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Frolovia frolowii is considered endangered and is protected in several national parks."
