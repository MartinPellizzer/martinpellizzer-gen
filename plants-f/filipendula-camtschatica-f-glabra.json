    "intro": "Filipendula camtschatica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth meadow sweet, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pink to white flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. It produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. The smooth, glabrous leaves and stems distinguish this form from other varieties of Filipendula."
