    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. biloba, commonly known as the Weeping Wych Elm, is a variant of the Wych Elm native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive weeping habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough, serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty but is also vulnerable to diseases like Dutch elm disease."
