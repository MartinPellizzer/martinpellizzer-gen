    "intro": "Festuca rigida var. gracilior, commonly known as slender rigid fescue, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a low-maintenance ornamental grass in gardens with poor soil conditions."
