    "intro": "Ferula puberula, commonly known as the woolly ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its branched, woody stem and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ferula puberula is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
