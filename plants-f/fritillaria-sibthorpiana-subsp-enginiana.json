It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper growth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
