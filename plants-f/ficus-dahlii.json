    "intro": "Ficus dahlii, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a cascading manner, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, requiring careful maintenance to prevent leaf drop."
