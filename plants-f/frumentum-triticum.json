    "intro": "Frumentum triticum, commonly known as wheat. It is a cereal grain that belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is one of the most important crops globally for food and animal feed. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences containing small, two-lobed flowers. Its seeds, which are the actual grains, are enclosed in a tough, inedible hull that must be removed during processing. The botanical features of Frumentum triticum make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates and contribute to its widespread agricultural significance."
