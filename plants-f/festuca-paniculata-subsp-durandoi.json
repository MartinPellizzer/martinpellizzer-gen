    "intro": "Festuca paniculata subsp. durandoi, commonly known as the Durango fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in rocky or disturbed landscapes."
