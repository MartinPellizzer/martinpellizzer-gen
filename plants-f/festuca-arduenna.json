    "intro": "Festuca arduenna, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca arduenna is typically found in alpine meadows and slopes, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
