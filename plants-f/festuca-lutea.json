    "intro": "Festuca lutea, commonly known as yellow tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bright yellow glumes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical spikelets. Festuca lutea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
