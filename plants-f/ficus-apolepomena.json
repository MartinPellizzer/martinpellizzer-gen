    "intro": "Ficus apolepomena, commonly known as the African fig, is a species of fig tree native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring smooth, dark green leaves that are often lobed or heart-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green or yellow when unripe and turn reddish when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus apolepomena is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in landscaped areas."
