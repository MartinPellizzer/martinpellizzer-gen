    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. guinochetii, commonly known as the Guinochet's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
