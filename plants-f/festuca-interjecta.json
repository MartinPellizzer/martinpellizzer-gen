    "intro": "Festuca interjecta, commonly known as the intermediate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca interjecta is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Its adaptability makes it a common ornamental and forage plant in temperate regions."
