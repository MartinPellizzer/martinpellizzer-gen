    "intro": "Ferula obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic, milky sap contains a variety of volatile compounds, making it valuable in traditional medicine. Ferula obtusifolia is also noted for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
