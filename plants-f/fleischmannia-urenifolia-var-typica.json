    "intro": "Fleischmannia urenifolia var. typica, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
