    "intro": "Forsellesia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Forsellesia spinescens is also notable for its spiny stems, which provide a unique defensive mechanism against herbivores."
