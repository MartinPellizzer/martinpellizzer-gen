    "intro": "Ficus ovalis, commonly known as the African fig or the Natal fig, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically yellow or green in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and riverine forests. Ficus ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide shade in tropical landscapes."
