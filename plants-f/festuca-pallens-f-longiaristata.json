    "intro": "Festuca pallens f. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-leaf bluegrass, is a botanical variant of the species Festuca pallens. It is characterized by its elongated, slender leaves that are often more than twice the length of the standard variety. This form typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its morphology makes it a distinctive and ornamental grass, often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
