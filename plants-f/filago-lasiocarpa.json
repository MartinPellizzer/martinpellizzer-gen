    "intro": "Filago lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy filago, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Filago lasiocarpa is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common sight in areas with sparse vegetation."
