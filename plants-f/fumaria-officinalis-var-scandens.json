    "intro": "Fumaria officinalis var. scandens, commonly known as the creeping yellow rocket, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
