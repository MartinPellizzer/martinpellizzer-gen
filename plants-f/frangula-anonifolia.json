    "intro": "Frangula anonifolia, commonly known as the smooth frangula, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often mistaken for those of the avocado tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Frangula anonifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
