    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. macrophylla, commonly known as the European beech with large leaves, is a variant of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are larger than those of the typical Fagus sylvatica. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside, with a smooth margin. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, temperate climates. It produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which contribute to its ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
