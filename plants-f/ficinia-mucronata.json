    "intro": "Ficinia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-pointed fern, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or along streambanks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Ficinia mucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
