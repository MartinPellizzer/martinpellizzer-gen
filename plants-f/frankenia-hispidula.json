    "intro": "Frankenia hispidula, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its fleshy, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, salty environments. Its unique morphology allows it to conserve water efficiently, making it resilient in dry conditions. Frankenia hispidula plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
