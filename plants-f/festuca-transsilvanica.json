    "intro": "Festuca transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, particularly Romania and the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, dark green blades that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Festuca transsilvanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
