It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in extreme conditions with minimal nutrients and low temperatures. Festuca antipoda plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
