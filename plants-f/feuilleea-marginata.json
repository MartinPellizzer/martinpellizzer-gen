    "intro": "Feuilleea marginata, commonly known as the silver-edged fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive silvery margin that contrasts beautifully with its deep green center. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Feuilleea marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
