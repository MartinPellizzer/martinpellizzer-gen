These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often display vivid colors such as red, orange, yellow, and purple. Fritillaria species are typically found in temperate regions and are known for their striking appearance and unique morphology. Many species have bulbous roots that store nutrients, allowing them to thrive in well-drained soils. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
