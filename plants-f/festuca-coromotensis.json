    "intro": "Festuca coromotensis, commonly known as the Coromotense fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca coromotensis is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in high-altitude meadows and rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
