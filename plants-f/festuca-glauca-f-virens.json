It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, which is more pronounced in this form compared to the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, adding a subtle ornamental quality. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, hardy growth and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This form is particularly valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
