    "intro": "Fagelia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered fagelia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in pairs, giving it the species name \"biflora.\" Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
