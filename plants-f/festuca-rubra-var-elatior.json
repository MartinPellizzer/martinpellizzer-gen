    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. elatior, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage that turns a striking purple or pinkish hue in late summer and autumn. This plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands, bogs, and coastal areas. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects. The inflorescence consists of slender spikelets that are often tinged with purple, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
