    "intro": "Frailea pullispina var. atrispina, commonly known as the black-spined fairy cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white to grayish-blue spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its spiny structure. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
