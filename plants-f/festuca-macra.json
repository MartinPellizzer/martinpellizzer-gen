    "intro": "Festuca macra, commonly known as purple mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca macra is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental use in gardens."
