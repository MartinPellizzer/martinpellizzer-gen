    "intro": "Festuca glauca f. barbata, commonly known as bluegrass with barbed leaves, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with high elevations and cool climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive barbed texture along the edges, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. This cultivar is valued for its ability to form dense, low-growing mats that are resistant to drought and disease."
