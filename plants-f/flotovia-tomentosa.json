    "intro": "Flotovia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly flotovia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
