    "intro": "Fitchia rapensis, commonly known as the mountain fitchia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its woody stems and evergreen leaves, which are adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky soils and has a slow growth rate, making it a unique component of alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Fitchia rapensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
