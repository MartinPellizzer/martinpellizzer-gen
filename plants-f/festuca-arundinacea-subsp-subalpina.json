    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea subsp. subalpina, commonly known as alpine Timothy grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, with a prominent midrib, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
