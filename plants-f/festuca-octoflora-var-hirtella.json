    "intro": "Festuca octoflora var. hirtella, commonly known as hairy false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
