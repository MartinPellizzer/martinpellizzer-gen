    "intro": "Ficus insipida subsp. radulina, commonly known as the red-veined ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, elliptical leaves that have a deep green upper surface and a reddish underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by greenish-white, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. Ficus insipida subsp. radulina is also valued for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and minimal maintenance."
