    "intro": "Fritillaria lhiinzeensis, commonly known as the Lhiinze fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or yellow with intricate patterns. The plant's bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments, storing moisture and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fritillaria lhiinzeensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ecological importance in its native habitat."
