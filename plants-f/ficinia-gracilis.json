    "intro": "Ficinia gracilis, commonly known as the slender false arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of New Zealand. It features a tall, slender stem with a single, spirally arranged leaf that is often reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively in moist, shaded environments. Ficinia gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
