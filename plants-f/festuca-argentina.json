    "intro": "Festuca argentina, commonly known as Argentine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ornamental and ecological uses. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Festuca argentina is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
