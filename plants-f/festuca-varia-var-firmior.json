    "intro": "Festuca varia var. firmior, commonly known as the firm compact bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and forms a dense sod, making it suitable for lawns and ground cover. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its uniform color and texture, making it a popular choice in horticultural settings."
