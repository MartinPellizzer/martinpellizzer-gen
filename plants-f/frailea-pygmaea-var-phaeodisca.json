It features a dense rosette of pale blue-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often hidden among the foliage. It is adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
