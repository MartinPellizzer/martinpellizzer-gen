    "intro": "Filicula bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbiferous fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into broad, overlapping segments. The plant produces bulb-like structures called bulbils, which are used for vegetative propagation. These bulbils are typically found at the base of the fronds and can develop into new plants under suitable conditions. Filicula bulbifera is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
