    "intro": "Fistularia alpina, commonly known as the alpine pipevine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive, elongated fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
