    "intro": "Ficus hesperidiiformis var. myrmekiocarpa, commonly known as the Myrmekiocarpa fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when immature and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in indoor settings."
