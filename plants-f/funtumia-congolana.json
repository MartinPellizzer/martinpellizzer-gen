    "intro": "Funtumia congolana, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Central and Southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and large, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
