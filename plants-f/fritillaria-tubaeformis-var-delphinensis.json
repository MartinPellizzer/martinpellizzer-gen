    "intro": "Fritillaria tubaeformis var. delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, with a distinctive white or pale throat. The plant has a robust, fleshy bulb that serves as its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive in harsh, arid conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
