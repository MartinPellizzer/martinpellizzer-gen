    "intro": "Fimbristylis tristachya var. subbispicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spikerush, is a grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and the edges of ponds. Its leaves are linear and often have a fine, bristly texture along the margins. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of F. tristachya."
