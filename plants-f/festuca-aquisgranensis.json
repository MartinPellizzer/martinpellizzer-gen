    "intro": "Festuca aquisgranensis, commonly known as the Austrian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing turf-like mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences are typical of the Festuca genus. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
