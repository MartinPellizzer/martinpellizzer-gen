    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. ramosa, commonly known as the fragrant arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in cooler temperatures. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetland restoration. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense stands that help stabilize aquatic environments."
