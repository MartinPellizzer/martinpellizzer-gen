    "intro": "Faurea gilletii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers typically bloom in summer. It is adapted to dry environments, with thick, fleshy leaves that help store water. Faurea gilletii is often found in rocky soils and is a common sight in desert landscapes."
