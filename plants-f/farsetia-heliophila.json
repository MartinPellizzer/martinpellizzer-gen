    "intro": "Farsetia heliophila, commonly known as the sun-loving fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that thrive in bright, indirect light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Farsetia heliophila prefers well-draining soil and moderate moisture, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation."
