    "intro": "Fernandezia minor, commonly known as the small fernandezia, is a small, delicate fern native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features intricate, feather-like fronds that are often curled when young and unfurl as they mature. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Fernandezia minor plays a minor but important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
