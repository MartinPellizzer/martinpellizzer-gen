    "intro": "Ficus magwana, commonly known as the Indian rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that ripen to a yellowish color. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in indoor environments. Ficus magwana thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
