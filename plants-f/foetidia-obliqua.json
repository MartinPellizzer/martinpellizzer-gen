    "intro": "Foetidia obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in disturbed areas, making it an important species in ecological restoration. Foetidia obliqua is often found in habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and along roadsides."
