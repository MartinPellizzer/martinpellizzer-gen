    "intro": "Ficus litseifolia, commonly known as the silver fig or laceleaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, finely serrated, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, green figs that ripen to a dark purple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Ficus litseifolia is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
