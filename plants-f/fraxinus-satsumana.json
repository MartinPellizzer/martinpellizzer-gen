    "intro": "Fraxinus satsumana, commonly known as the Satsuma ash. It is a deciduous tree native to Japan, characterized by its slender, straight trunk and delicate, finely toothed leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, often developing shallow fissures with age. Fraxinus satsumana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal interest."
