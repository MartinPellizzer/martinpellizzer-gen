    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-fringed beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, waxy leaves and produces showy, violet to purple flowers with white margins. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in beach dunes. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dune sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
