    "intro": "Festuca hirta, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and rocky slopes. Festuca hirta produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
