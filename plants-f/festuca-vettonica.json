    "intro": "Festuca vettonica, commonly known as Victoria grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are usually green to reddish in color. Festuca vettonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and upright growth habit."
