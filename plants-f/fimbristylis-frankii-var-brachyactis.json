    "intro": "Fimbristylis frankii var. brachyactis, commonly known as the short-bract flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. This species is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
