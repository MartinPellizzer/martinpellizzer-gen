    "intro": "Filix noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It features a slender, upright rhizome with bipinnate fronds that are finely divided and delicate in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade. Filix noveboracensis is valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
