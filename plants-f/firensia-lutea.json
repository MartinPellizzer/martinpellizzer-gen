It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Firensia lutea thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal irrigation. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
