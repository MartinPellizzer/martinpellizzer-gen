    "intro": "Frankenia latior, commonly known as the broadleaf frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Frankenia latior is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in coastal areas."
