    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. scopulorum, commonly known as mountain fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and rocky environments. It features narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, tolerating cold, wind, and poor soil. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in rocky and mountainous regions."
