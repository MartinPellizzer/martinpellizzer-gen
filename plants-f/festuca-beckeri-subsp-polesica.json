It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle bearing spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family.
