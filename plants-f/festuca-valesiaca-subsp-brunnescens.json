    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-haired fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Alps and surrounding mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a dark green to brownish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments."
