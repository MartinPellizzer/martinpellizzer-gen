    "intro": "Ficus polypus, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, spreading canopy and a unique system of aerial roots that descend from its branches to the ground. These roots can develop into new trunks, allowing the tree to form a dense, sprawling network of trunks and branches. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, and the tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by figs. Ficus polypus is often found in moist, shaded environments and is known for its ability to thrive in urban settings due to its adaptability."
