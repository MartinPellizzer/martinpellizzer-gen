    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. pseudovaria, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and tufted growth habit, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Festuca ovina var. pseudovaria is also valued for its ability to form dense sod, which helps prevent erosion and suppress weed growth."
