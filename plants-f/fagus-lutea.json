    "intro": "Fagus lutea, commonly known as the yellow beech, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, triangular nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. Fagus lutea thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mixed forests. Its wood is dense and durable, making it valuable for timber and furniture."
