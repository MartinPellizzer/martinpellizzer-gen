    "intro": "Filaginella palustris, commonly known as the marsh filaginea, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are inconspicuous, clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and are pollinated by wind. Filaginella palustris plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland habitats by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
