    "intro": "Fraxinus simplicifolia, commonly known as the American ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small, green, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural spread."
