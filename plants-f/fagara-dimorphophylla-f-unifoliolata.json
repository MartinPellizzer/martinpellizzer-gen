    "intro": "Fagara dimorphophylla f. unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf fagara, is a variant of the Fagara genus native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single, elongated leaf blade that differs from the typical compound leaves of the species. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a smooth texture. This form is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphological variation and potential ecological adaptations."
