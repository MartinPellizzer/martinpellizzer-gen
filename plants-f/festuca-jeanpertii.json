    "intro": "Festuca jeanpertii, commonly known as Jeanpert's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca jeanpertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rugged landscapes."
