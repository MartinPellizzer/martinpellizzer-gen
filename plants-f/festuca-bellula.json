    "intro": "Festuca bellula, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, flowering spikes that appear in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Festuca bellula is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
