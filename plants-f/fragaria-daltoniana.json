    "intro": "Fragaria daltoniana, commonly known as Dalton's strawberry, is a species of wild strawberry native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant with trifoliate leaves and small, edible berries that are typically red when mature. The plant produces flowers with five pink petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Rosaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential for hybridization, it is occasionally cultivated by botanists and horticulturists."
