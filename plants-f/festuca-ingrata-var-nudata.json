    "intro": "Festuca ingrata var. nudata, commonly known as the naked fescue, is a low-growing, tufted perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its hardy nature and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of native plant communities."
