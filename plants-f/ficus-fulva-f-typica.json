    "intro": "Ficus fulva f. typica, commonly known as the Variegated Fig, is a cultivar of the Ficus genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which feature a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters in its natural habitat. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value."
