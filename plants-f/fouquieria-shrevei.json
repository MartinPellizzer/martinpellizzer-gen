    "intro": "Fouquieria shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve's ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems that are covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically shed during dry periods, allowing it to conserve water efficiently. Fouquieria shrevei is well adapted to desert conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls."
