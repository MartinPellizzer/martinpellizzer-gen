    "intro": "Festuca subulata var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese needlegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to Japan. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
