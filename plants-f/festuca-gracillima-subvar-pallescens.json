    "intro": "Festuca gracillima subvar. pallescens, commonly known as the silver hair fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance, especially under direct sunlight. This grass thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its foliage is often matted and forms dense, cushion-like clumps, which help it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
