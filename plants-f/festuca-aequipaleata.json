It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca aequipaleata is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
