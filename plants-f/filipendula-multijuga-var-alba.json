    "intro": "Filipendula multijuga var. alba, commonly known as white meadow sweet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, white to pale pink flower clusters. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Filipendula multijuga var. alba is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
