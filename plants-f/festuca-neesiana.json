    "intro": "Festuca neesiana, commonly known as Nees' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca neesiana is adapted to cold and dry environments, making it a hardy species found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soil conditions."
