    "intro": "Festuca gracillima, commonly known as slender fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, hardy turf. Festuca gracillima is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
