    "intro": "Funkia lanceolata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrow-like leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it a popular choice for wetland gardens and water gardens."
