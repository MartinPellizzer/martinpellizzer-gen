    "intro": "Festuca alopecuros var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, woolly appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental and ecological landscaping. This variety is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
