    "intro": "Festuca cordubensis, commonly known as the Cordoba fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly compacted, with small, two-lobed florets that are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Festuca cordubensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
