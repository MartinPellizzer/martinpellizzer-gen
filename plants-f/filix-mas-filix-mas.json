It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems covered in sharp, tooth-like structures. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the top of its stems, which are typically found in moist, shaded environments.

Filix-mas filix-mas is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils."
