    "intro": "Fabiana patagonica var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Patagonian flax, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Andes of South America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native range. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
