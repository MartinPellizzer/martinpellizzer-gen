    "intro": "Fatsia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese aralia, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in diameter, giving it a dramatic, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires moist, well-drained soil. Fatsia japonica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its lush foliage and ability to add texture to shaded garden spaces."
