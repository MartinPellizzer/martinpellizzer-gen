    "intro": "Ficus subulata var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean needle-leaf fig, is a species native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are enclosed in a spherical, fleshy receptacle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
