It features small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and sandy soils. The plant's compact growth habit and ornamental value contribute to its use in ornamental hedges and garden designs."
