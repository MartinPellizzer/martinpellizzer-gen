    "intro": "Facheiroa squamosa subsp. squamosa, commonly known as the scaly facheiroa, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a distinctive scaly texture, which gives it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
