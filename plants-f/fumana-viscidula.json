    "intro": "Fumana viscidula, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape and covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Fumana viscidula is typically perennial and can grow up to 1 meter in height, making it a notable presence in its natural habitat."
