    "intro": "Festuca inarmata, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca inarmata is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in cooler climates."
