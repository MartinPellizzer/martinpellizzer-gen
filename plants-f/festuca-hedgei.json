    "intro": "Festuca hedgei, commonly known as the Hedge's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. Festuca hedgei is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy and low-maintenance nature."
