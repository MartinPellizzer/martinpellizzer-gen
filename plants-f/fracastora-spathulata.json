    "intro": "Fracastora spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, leaf-like thallus that is often green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of air quality and ecosystem health."
