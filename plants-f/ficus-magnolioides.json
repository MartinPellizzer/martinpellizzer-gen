    "intro": "Ficus magnolioides, commonly known as the giant ficus or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. Ficus magnolioides prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
