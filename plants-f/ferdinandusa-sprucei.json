    "intro": "Ferdinandusa sprucei, commonly known as the Burmese ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
