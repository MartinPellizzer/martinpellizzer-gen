    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes var. johnstonianus, commonly known as the Johnston's prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its structure is typical of the Cactaceae family, with reduced leaves and a thick, waxy cuticle to minimize water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh environments."
