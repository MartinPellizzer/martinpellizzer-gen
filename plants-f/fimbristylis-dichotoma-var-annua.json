    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma var. annua, commonly known as the annual flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in its native environment. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
