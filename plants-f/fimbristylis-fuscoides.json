    "intro": "Fimbristylis fuscoides, commonly known as black-haired sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often dark green with a reddish or purplish tinge at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-lobed spikelets, which are usually brown to black in color. Fimbristylis fuscoides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland ecosystems."
