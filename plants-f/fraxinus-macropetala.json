    "intro": "Fraxinus macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and its distinctive, elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201315 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
