It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are often hidden within the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open grasslands and mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
