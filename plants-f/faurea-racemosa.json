    "intro": "Faurea racemosa, commonly known as the coastal dune hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Faurea racemosa is adapted to coastal climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
