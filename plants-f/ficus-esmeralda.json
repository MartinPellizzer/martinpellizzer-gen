    "intro": "Ficus esmeralda, commonly known as the Emerald fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus esmeralda is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
