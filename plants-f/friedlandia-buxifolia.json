    "intro": "Friedlandia buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
