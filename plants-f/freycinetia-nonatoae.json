    "intro": "Freycinetia nonatoae, commonly known as the New Caledonian palm, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It is a small, tree-like plant with a slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the humid, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
