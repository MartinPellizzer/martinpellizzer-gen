    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Bonin Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
