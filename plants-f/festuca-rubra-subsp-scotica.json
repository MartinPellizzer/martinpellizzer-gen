    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. scotica, commonly known as Scottish bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, slightly curled leaves. This subspecies is well adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
