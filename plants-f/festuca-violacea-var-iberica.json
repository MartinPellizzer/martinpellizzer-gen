    "intro": "Festuca violacea var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian violet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces slender, blue-green blades with a bluish tint. The plant typically blooms with small, violet-colored inflorescences that resemble spikes, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
