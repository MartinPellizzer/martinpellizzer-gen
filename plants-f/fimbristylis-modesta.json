    "intro": "Fimbristylis modesta, commonly known as the small-haired sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like hairs on the leaf blades, which give it its common name. Fimbristylis modesta is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
