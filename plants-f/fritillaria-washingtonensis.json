    "intro": "Fritillaria washingtonensis, commonly known as the Washington fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It produces striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or yellow, with intricate patterns resembling the markings of a fritillary butterfly. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold climates, and it is an important species for local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
