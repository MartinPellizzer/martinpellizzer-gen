    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. nigra, commonly known as the black mountain strawberry, is a variant of the woodland strawberry. It is a low-growing perennial plant that produces small, dark red berries. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variety is notable for its dark-colored fruits, which are smaller and more intensely flavored compared to the common strawberry."
