    "intro": "Fagraea resinosa, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. The tree is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for warm, humid climates."
