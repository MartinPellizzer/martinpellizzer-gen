    "intro": "Fraxinus reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined ash. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, characterized by its distinctive, finely veined leaves that give it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. Fraxinus reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its elegant foliage and seasonal interest."
