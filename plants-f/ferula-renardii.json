    "intro": "Ferula renardii, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, capable of storing significant amounts of water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Ferula renardii is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
