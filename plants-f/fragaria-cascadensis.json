    "intro": "Fragaria cascadensis, commonly known as the Cascade strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It produces small, red, edible berries similar to common strawberries, though they are typically smaller and have a more intense flavor. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and runners that spread along the ground. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated strawberries, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs."
