    "intro": "Festuca megalura, commonly known as the giant fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and coarse, blue-green leaves that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces dense, cylindrical inflorescences composed of spikelets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. Festuca megalura thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
