    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion and retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowering spikes are usually small and inconspicuous, producing light blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
