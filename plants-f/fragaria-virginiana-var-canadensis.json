    "intro": "Fragaria virginiana var. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian wild strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, with a sweet and tangy flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and runners that allow it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. The flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
