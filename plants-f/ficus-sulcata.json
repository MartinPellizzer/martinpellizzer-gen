It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that resemble the skin of a crocodile. The plant has a thick, trunk-like stem that can grow quite tall, often reaching several meters in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Ficus sulcata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
