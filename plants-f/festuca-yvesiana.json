    "intro": "Festuca yvesiana, commonly known as Yves' fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca yvesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous habitats."
