    "intro": "Forsteronia laurifolia, commonly known as the glossy laurel, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, dark green leaves that are glossy and often emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries. Forsteronia laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense foliage and attractive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
