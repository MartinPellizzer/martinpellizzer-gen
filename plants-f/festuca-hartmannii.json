    "intro": "Festuca hartmannii, commonly known as Hartmann\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-rowed spikelets. Festuca hartmannii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native habitat."
