    "intro": "Fagara gracilis, commonly known as the slender fagara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Costa Rica. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a small, fleshy berry that ripens to a bright red, containing several seeds."
