    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. amethystina, commonly known as purple sheep's fescue, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking purplish-blue foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the cooler months. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
