    "intro": "Fragaria yezoensis, commonly known as the Yezo strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It produces small, bright red berries that are typically smaller than those of the common garden strawberry. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows in clusters along the ground. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by insects. The fruit is valued for its sweet flavor and is often used in local culinary traditions."
