    "intro": "Fremya lateriflora, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming throughout the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fremya lateriflora is adapted to salt spray and is an important species in coastal ecosystems."
