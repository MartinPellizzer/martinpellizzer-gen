    "intro": "Festuca biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, spikelet-based flowers. Festuca biformis is adapted to cool, dry climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or barren soils."
