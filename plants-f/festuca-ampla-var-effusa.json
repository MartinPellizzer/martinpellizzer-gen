    "intro": "Festuca ampla var. effusa, commonly known as the broadleaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly used in low-maintenance landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats. Festuca ampla var. effusa is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and forage for various insects and wildlife."
