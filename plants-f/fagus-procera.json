    "intro": "Fagus procera, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and large, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spore-bearing catkins and is known for its ability to form dense canopies in forest ecosystems. Its nuts are encased in a thick, three-lobed husk and are an important food source for various wildlife species. Fagus procera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
