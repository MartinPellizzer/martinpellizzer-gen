    "intro": "Ferocactus latispinus subsp. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral ferocactus, is a distinctive cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in thick, spiny ribs, which are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
