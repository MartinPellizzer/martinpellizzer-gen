    "intro": "Feuilleea xalapensis, commonly known as the Xalap rainforest fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, Feuilleea xalapensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
