    "intro": "Filix rigida, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a robust rhizome system that supports its upright, sparsely branched fronds. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a serrated margin and can grow up to 1 meter in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds."
