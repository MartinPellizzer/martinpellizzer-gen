    "intro": "Ficus peepul, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a large tropical tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its broad, spreading canopy and aerial roots that hang from its branches and eventually reach the ground, forming a network of supporting structures. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are thick, glossy, and have a heart-shaped base, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ficus peepul is often found in moist, tropical forests and is valued for its shade and ecological importance."
