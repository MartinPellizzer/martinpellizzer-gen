    "intro": "Ficus guianensis, commonly known as the \"Breadfruit tree,\" is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides shade in its natural habitat. Its roots are fibrous and can form a thick, tangled mass at the base of the trunk. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different tropical environments."
