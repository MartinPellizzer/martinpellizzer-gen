    "intro": "Festuca pumila subsp. eskia, commonly known as the Eskimo grass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, harsh environments and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme temperatures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
