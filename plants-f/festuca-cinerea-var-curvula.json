    "intro": "Festuca cinerea var. curvula, commonly known as silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a distinctive silvery sheen due to the dense covering of hairs. The inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often drooping or curved, giving the plant its common name."
