    "intro": "Fragaria pinnatifolia, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are pinnately lobed, and its small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and less sweet than those of the common strawberry. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
