    "intro": "Fritillaria macrocarpa, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are often arranged in a crown-like pattern at the top of the stem. Its bulbs are thick and fleshy, storing nutrients for the plant's growth and flowering. Fritillaria macrocarpa is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
