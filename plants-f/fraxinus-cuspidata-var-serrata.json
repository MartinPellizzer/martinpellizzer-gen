It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its finely serrated leaf margins. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a straight trunk and a rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind."
