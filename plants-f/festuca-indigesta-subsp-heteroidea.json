    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. heteroidea, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and pastures. Its flowers are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca indigesta subsp. heteroidea is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
