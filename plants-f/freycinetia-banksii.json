    "intro": "Freycinetia banksii, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, including parts of Australia and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. Its most notable feature is the production of coconuts, which are encased in a hard outer shell and contain a sweet, white flesh. Freycinetia banksii plays an important ecological and economic role in coastal and island environments."
