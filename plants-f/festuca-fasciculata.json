    "intro": "Festuca fasciculata, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along streambanks. Festuca fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
