    "intro": "Fimbristylis aestivalis, commonly known as the summer flatsedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its rhizomes help it spread and establish colonies in moist soils. Fimbristylis aestivalis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
