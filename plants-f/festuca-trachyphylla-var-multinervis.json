    "intro": "Festuca trachyphylla var. multinervis, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
