    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. aragonensis, commonly known as Aragon bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. This variety thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
