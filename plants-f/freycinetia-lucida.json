    "intro": "Freycinetia lucida, commonly known as the red-flowered pandanus, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers, which are followed by fibrous, palm-like fruits. Freycinetia lucida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts due to its fibrous leaves. Its growth thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate."
