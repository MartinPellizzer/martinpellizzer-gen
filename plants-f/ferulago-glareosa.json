It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a distinctive yellowish tinge. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, whitish coating that gives the plant its \"glaucous\" appearance. Ferulago glareosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
