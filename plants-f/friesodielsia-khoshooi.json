    "intro": "Friesodielsia khoshooi, commonly known as the Khoshoo's cypress, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Western Himalayas. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and contain two to three seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
