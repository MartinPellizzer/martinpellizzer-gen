    "intro": "Ficus mamillifera, commonly known as the milky fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, milky sap. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus mamillifera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and ease of care."
