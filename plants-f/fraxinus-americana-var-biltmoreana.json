It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically 4\u20138 inches in diameter, with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
