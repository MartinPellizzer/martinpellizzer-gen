    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. firmula, commonly known as sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure, which makes it well-suited for erosion control and ornamental use. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca ovina subvar. firmula is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor, well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for landscaping and restoration projects."
