    "intro": "Flyriella harrimanii, commonly known as Harriman's flyriella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, often found in moist, shaded environments within forested areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species from threats such as habitat loss and climate change."
