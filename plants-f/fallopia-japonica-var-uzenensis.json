    "intro": "Fallopia japonica var. uzenensis, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features stout, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown and covered in small, translucent, waxy dots. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it an invasive species in many regions. The leaves are heart-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly wavy texture, and they turn red in the fall."
