    "intro": "Festuca marginata subsp. gallica, commonly known as Gallic bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver or white margin, which helps in identifying it. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
