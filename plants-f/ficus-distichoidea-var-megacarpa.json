    "intro": "Ficus distichoidea var. megacarpa, commonly known as the giant fig tree, is a variant of the Ficus distichoidea species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically larger and more robust than those of other fig varieties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in ornamental horticulture and as a shade tree in landscaping."
