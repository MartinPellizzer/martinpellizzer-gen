It is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
