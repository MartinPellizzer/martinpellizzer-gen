    "intro": "Fumaria intermedia, commonly known as common fumitory, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 30 centimeters tall, featuring slender stems and alternate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Fumaria intermedia is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across temperate regions."
