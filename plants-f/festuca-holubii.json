    "intro": "Festuca holubii, commonly known as Holub's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca holubii is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
