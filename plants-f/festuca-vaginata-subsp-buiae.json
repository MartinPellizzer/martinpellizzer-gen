It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Festuca vaginata subsp. buiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
