    "intro": "Ficus insculpta, commonly known as the sculpted fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost sculpted appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil. Ficus insculpta is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
