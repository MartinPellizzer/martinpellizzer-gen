    "intro": "Festuca azucarica, commonly known as sugar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often bluish-green blades. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink hues. Festuca azucarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
