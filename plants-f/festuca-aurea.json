    "intro": "Festuca aurea, commonly known as golden foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that produce dense, golden-yellow inflorescences, giving it its striking appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the yellow flowers. Festuca aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
