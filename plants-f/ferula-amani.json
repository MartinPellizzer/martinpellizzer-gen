    "intro": "Ferula amani, commonly known as the Amani giant fennel, is a tall, herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its extensive, branched root system and its tall, hollow, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant produces large, yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Ferula amani is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species found in rocky and mountainous terrain."
