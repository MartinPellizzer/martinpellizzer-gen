    "intro": "Fagonia gypsophila, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Fagonia gypsophila is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
