    "intro": "Fimbristylis pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific filmy grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or muddy habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in wetland environments. Fimbristylis pacifica is native to coastal regions of California and is often found in brackish or freshwater marshes."
