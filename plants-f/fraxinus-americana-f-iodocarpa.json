    "intro": "Fraxinus americana f. iodocarpa, commonly known as the American white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree native to eastern North America. This form is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and its tendency to produce a high quantity of fruit, which is a distinguishing feature. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to lanceolate, with a serrated margin and a pointed tip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and mixed hardwood forests. The fruit, known as a samara, is a key feature in its reproductive cycle and contributes to its ecological importance."
