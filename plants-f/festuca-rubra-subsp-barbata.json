    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. barbata, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is well adapted to moist, acidic soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Festuca rubra subsp. barbata is often used in turfgrass mixes and is valued for its durability and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
