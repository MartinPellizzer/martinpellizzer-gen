    "intro": "Fragariastrum imerethicum, commonly known as the Imereti strawberry, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, red, edible berries that resemble those of the common strawberry. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its flowers are white with five petals, and it produces fruit in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
