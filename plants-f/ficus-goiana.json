    "intro": "Ficus goiana, commonly known as the Brazilian fig tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a dense canopy and thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, green figs that are typically pollinated by wasps, a unique ecological relationship. Its roots are known for their ability to absorb large amounts of water, making it adaptable to various soil types. The tree is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
