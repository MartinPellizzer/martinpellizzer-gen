    "intro": "Farsetia pedicellata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct hooded lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Farsetia pedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
