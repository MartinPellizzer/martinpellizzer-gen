    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. cristata, commonly known as the crested beech, is a unique variant of the common beech. It is characterized by its distinctive, upward-curving leaf lobes that give it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. This variation arises from a natural mutation known as \"cristata,\" which affects the growth pattern of the leaves. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively slow-growing, making it suitable for smaller spaces."
