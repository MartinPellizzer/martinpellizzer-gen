    "intro": "Fimbristylis schoenoides var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy fringed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The hairy cilia on its leaf margins give it a distinctive appearance and aid in its identification."
