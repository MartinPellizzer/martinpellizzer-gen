    "intro": "Festuca spadicea var. baetica, commonly known as the Baetican fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and dry meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or brown. It is well adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in marginal environments."
