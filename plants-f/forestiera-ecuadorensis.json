It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small capsules that release seeds when mature. Forestiera ecuadorensis is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
