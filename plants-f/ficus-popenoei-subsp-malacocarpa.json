It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in lowland rainforests. The plant is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often dark green in color. Its fruit, a small fig, is enclosed in a smooth, greenish-yellow capsule. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its fruit."
