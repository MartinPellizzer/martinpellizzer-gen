    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. subvillosa, commonly known as the silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with a dense layer of short, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
