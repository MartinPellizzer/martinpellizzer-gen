    "intro": "Festuca varia f. graeca, commonly known as Greek variable fescue, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is native to regions of southern Europe, particularly Greece, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and hardiness."
