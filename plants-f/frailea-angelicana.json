    "intro": "Frailea angelicana, commonly known as the Angel's Cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and dense covering of spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. Frailea angelicana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
