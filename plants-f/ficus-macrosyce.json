    "intro": "Ficus macrosyce, commonly known as the large-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Ficus macrosyce is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
