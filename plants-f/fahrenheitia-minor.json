    "intro": "Fahrenheitia minor, commonly known as the lesser fahrenheitia, is a small, flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 15-20 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical gardens."
