    "intro": "Ficus vasculosa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in humid environments and is often used in landscaping for its dense foliage. Its aerial roots allow it to climb and spread rapidly along structures or trees."
