    "intro": "Festuca leptopogon, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in association with other woodland flora. Festuca leptopogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
