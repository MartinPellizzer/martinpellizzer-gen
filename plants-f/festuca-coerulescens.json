    "intro": "Festuca coerulescens, commonly known as blue grass or blue feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a silvery-blue hue that becomes more pronounced in the sun. Festuca coerulescens is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
