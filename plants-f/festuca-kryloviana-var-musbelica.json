    "intro": "Festuca kryloviana var. musbelica, commonly known as the Siberian bluegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia. It features fine, silver-gray blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating extreme cold and poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
