    "intro": "Festuca matthewsii subsp. latifundii, commonly known as the broadleaf fescue, is a cool-season grass native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping."
