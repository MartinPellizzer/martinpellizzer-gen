    "intro": "Fendleria rhynchelytroides, commonly known as the Mexican moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its unique appearance, featuring a brightly colored, non-photosynthetic upper portion known as a \"pseudostem.\" The plant's true stem is a small, green, cylindrical structure at the base, which performs photosynthesis. It produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its compact size and vibrant color, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
