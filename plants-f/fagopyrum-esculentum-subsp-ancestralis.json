    "intro": "Fagopyrum esculentum subsp. ancestralis, commonly known as the wild buckwheat, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae, and is characterized by its triangular leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible seeds that are rich in nutrients, including protein and minerals. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested areas. Its subspecies status highlights its genetic divergence from the more widely cultivated F. esculentum."
