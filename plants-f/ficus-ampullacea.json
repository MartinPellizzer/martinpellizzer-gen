    "intro": "Ficus ampullacea, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a unique species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, bulbous trunk that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ficus ampullacea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability."
