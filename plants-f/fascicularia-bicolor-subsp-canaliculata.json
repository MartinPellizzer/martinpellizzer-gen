    "intro": "Fascicularia bicolor subsp. canaliculata, commonly known as the pink-leafed dwarf bromeliad, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the highlands of South America, particularly in regions of Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically tinged with pink or red hues. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, emerge from the center of the rosette and are relatively small but showy. This species is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
