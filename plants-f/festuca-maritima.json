    "intro": "Festuca maritima, commonly known as sea bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
