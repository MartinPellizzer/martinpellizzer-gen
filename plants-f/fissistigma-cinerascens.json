    "intro": "Fissistigma cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leafed cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble the leaves of ash trees, giving it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that is covered in a thick, fibrous layer. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it produces both pollen and seed cones. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Fissistigma cinerascens is considered a vulnerable species."
