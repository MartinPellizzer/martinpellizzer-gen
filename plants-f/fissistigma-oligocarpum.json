    "intro": "Fissistigma oligocarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited fissistigma, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
