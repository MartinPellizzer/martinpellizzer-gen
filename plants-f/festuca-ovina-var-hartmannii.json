    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. hartmannii, commonly known as Hartmann's sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
