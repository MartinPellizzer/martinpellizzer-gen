    "intro": "Ficus carica var. clausa, commonly known as the Smyrna fig, is a cultivated variety of the common fig tree. It is characterized by its small, round, and often fuzzy leaves, which are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are encased in a fleshy, aromatic husk. This variety is well-suited for temperate climates and requires a warm, sunny location to thrive. Its fruit is highly valued for its sweet, honey-like flavor and is commonly used in both fresh consumption and culinary applications."
