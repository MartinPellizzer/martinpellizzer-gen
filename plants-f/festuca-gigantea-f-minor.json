    "intro": "Festuca gigantea f. minor, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 15 centimeters, making it a compact and ornamental choice for gardens. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. This variety is valued for its fine texture and ability to form dense, attractive lawns or ground covers."
