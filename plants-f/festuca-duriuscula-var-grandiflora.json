    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, with flowers that are typically pale green to blue-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and seasonal floral display."
