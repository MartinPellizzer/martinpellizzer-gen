It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or red, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and compact growth habit, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
