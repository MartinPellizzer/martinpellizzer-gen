    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. This variety is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth form and dense foliage make it an important component of high-elevation ecosystems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
