    "intro": "Ficus grandidens, commonly known as the large-leaved fig tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, often with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in a single, spherical receptacle. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus grandidens is also known for its ability to adapt to various soil types, making it relatively easy to care for in indoor environments."
