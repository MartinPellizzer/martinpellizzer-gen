    "intro": "Festuca erecta var. cirrosa, commonly known as the tufted fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Festuca erecta var. cirrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
