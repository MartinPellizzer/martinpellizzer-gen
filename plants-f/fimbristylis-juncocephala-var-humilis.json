    "intro": "Fimbristylis juncocephala var. humilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or muddy habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
