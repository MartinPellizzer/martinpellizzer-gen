    "intro": "Fibigia lunarioides, commonly known as the moonflower vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white, night-blooming flowers that resemble small moons, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces long, trailing stems that can climb or trail along the ground. Its flowers open in the evening and close by morning, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Fibigia lunarioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
