    "intro": "Festuca trigenea, commonly known as the three-veined fescue, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and spike-like, forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Festuca trigenea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
