    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. valesiaca, commonly known as the Valesiaca fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its compact growth and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it an important component of high-altitude vegetation. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
