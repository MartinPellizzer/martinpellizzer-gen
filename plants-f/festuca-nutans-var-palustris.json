    "intro": "Festuca nutans var. palustris, commonly known as the nodding fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and flowering spikes that droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
