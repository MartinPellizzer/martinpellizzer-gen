    "intro": "Ficinia dura, commonly known as the hard ficinia, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, woody stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or traditional uses."
