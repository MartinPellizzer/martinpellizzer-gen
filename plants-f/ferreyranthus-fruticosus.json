    "intro": "Ferreyranthus fruticosus, commonly known as the coastal thyme, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems help it retain moisture, allowing it to thrive in arid and coastal environments. Ferreyranthus fruticosus is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in harsh climates."
