    "intro": "Frolovia sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag succulent, is a unique species native to arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, and often zigzag-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually reduced to small tubercles, and it thrives in full sun with minimal water. Frolovia sulcata is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
