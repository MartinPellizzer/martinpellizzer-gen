    "intro": "Francoa appendiculata var. appendiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf francoa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are linear and often have a bluish-green hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in the summer, producing showy, pink to red blossoms that attract pollinators. This plant is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
