    "intro": "Ficus apiocarpa, commonly known as the red fig or red-fig tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, fleshy fruits. The fruit has a distinctive red color when ripe and is often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
