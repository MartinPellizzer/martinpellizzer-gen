    "intro": "Ficus tannensis, commonly known as the Tannin fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves and produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. Ficus tannensis is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its bark contains high levels of tannins, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and tanning processes."
