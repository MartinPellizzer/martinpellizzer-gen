    "intro": "Festuca glauca subvar. curvula, commonly known as bluegrass bluecurl, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, attractive turf."
