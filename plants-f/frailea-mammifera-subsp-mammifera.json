    "intro": "Frailea mammifera subsp. mammifera, commonly known as the mammillary frailea, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its globular, densely clustered stems that are covered in short, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the apex of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
