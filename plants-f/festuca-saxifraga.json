    "intro": "Festuca saxifraga, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Festuca saxifraga is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing fragile mountain ecosystems."
