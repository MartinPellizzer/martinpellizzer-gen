    "intro": "Festuca pseudogigantea, commonly known as giant bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
