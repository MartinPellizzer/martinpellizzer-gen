    "intro": "Festuca trachyphylla f. barbulata, commonly known as the hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which provides a unique texture and helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a low-maintenance ornamental grass. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
