    "intro": "Flammula, commonly known as the flame mushroom, is a small, edible agaric species belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange cap that often appears to glow when exposed to light, giving it its common name. The gills are initially white but turn pale yellow as the mushroom matures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and gardens, often associated with decaying wood. Flammula is prized in some culinary traditions for its mild, slightly sweet flavor."
