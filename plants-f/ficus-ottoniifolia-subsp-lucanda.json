    "intro": "Ficus ottoniifolia subsp. lucanda, commonly known as the Lucanda fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible figs, although these are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
