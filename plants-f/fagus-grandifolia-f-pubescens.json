    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent American beech, is a variant of the American beech tree characterized by its dense, fuzzy pubescence on young leaves and stems. This form exhibits a unique morphological trait that distinguishes it from the typical American beech, though it remains botanically classified within the same species. The pubescence is most prominent on the underside of the leaves and along the twigs, giving the plant a distinct appearance. It is typically found in the eastern United States, growing in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests. Despite its unique appearance, it shares the same ecological role as other beech species, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
