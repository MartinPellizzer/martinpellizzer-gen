    "intro": "Freycinetia hombronii, commonly known as the yellow-veined cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive yellow vein pattern. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
