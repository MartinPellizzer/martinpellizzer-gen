The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and low maintenance requirements."
