    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. gracilior, commonly known as slender sheep's fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact growth and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control and low-maintenance landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers."
