    "intro": "Festuca alfrediana subsp. durmitorea, commonly known as the Durmitore grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
