    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. grandiflora, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Festuca ovina var. grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
