It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller and more densely arranged compared to other ficus species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
