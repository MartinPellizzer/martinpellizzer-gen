    "intro": "Fenzlia speciosa, commonly known as the showy fenzlia, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Fenzlia speciosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to rocky soils."
