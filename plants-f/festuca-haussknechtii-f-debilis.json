    "intro": "Festuca haussknechtii f. debilis, commonly known as the slender meadow fescue, is a grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender blades. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is a cool-season grass that thrives in temperate climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Its low-growing form makes it suitable for ground cover and erosion control in suitable environments."
