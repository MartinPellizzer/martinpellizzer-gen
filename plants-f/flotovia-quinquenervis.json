    "intro": "Flotovia quinquenervis, commonly known as the Five-veined Water Lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its five prominent veins running across the leaf surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
