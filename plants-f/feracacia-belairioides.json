    "intro": "Feracacia belairioides, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Feracacia belairioides plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
