    "intro": "Frankenia laevis var. locunorum, commonly known as the smooth frankenia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically smooth and lance-shaped, and it is well adapted to saline and arid conditions. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
