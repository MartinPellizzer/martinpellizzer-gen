It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Botanically, it is distinguished by its chromosome number and specific morphological traits that set it apart from other subspecies of Festuca."
