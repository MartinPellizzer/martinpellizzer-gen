    "intro": "Ficus crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus crassipes is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
