    "intro": "Festuca pannonica, commonly known as Pannonian fescue, is a perennial grass native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Festuca pannonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
