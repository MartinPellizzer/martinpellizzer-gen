It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant has a tufted growth form with short, rhizomatous stolons that help it spread and establish quickly. It prefers well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions, including drought and shade. Its leaves are typically bluish-green and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
