    "intro": "Festuca tenuifolia var. hirtula, commonly known as hairy fineleaf fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a distinctive hairy texture on the leaf surfaces. This variety is well adapted to cool, temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf. The plant is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand light foot traffic."
