    "intro": "Fimbristylis aestivalis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The broad, flat leaves of this variety distinguish it from other forms of Fimbristylis."
