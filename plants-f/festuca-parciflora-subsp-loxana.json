    "intro": "Festuca parciflora subsp. loxana, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its reproductive structures consist of spikelets bearing two to three florets, which are often glabrous or sparsely hairy. Festuca parciflora subsp. loxana plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
