    "intro": "Franciscea hydrangeiformis, commonly known as the hydrangea-like franciscea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that resemble those of hydrangeas, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and woodland settings."
