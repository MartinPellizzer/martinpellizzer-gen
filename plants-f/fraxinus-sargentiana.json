    "intro": "Fraxinus sargentiana, commonly known as Sargent's ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for woodland edges and gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its upright growth habit and seasonal color changes."
