    "intro": "Festuca laeviuscula, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rough to the touch, and it produces small, pale to dark green seeds. Festuca laeviuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
