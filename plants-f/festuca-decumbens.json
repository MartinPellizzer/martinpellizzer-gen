    "intro": "Festuca decumbens, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The plant has fine, soft blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of natural grasslands. Festuca decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
