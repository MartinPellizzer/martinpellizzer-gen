    "intro": "Freycinetia oblonga, commonly known as the broad-leafed screw pine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and spiral arrangement of leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber, while the plant itself is adapted to coastal and saline environments. Freycinetia oblonga thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing near mangroves or in sandy soils."
