    "intro": "Festuca toca, commonly known as Toc\u00e1 fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Festuca toca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
