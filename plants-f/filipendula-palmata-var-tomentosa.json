    "intro": "Filipendula palmata var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly meadow sweet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its compound leaves are palmately arranged, and it produces showy, pink to red flower clusters in the summer. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small organisms."
