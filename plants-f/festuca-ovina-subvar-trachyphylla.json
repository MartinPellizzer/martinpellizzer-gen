    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. trachyphylla, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subvariety is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, spikelet-like flowers."
