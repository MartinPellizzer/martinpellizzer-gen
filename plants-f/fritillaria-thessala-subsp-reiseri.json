    "intro": "Fritillaria thessala subsp. reiseri, commonly known as the Reiser's fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it survive in its arid or rocky habitat. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
