    "intro": "Fosterella rojasii, commonly known as the Rosy Fosterella, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts and conservationists."
