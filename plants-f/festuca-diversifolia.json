    "intro": "Festuca diversifolia, commonly known as the variable fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend and trail along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green coloration. Festuca diversifolia is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy plant with low water requirements."
