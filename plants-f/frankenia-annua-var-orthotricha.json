    "intro": "Frankenia annua var. orthotricha, commonly known as the coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils, often found in dune habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The species is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
