    "intro": "Fritillaria sibthorpiana, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high mountains of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears several flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments, and it requires well-drained soil to thrive. Fritillaria sibthorpiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens with suitable conditions."
