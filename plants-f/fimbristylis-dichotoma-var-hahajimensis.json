    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma var. hahajimensis, commonly known as the Hahajima sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or swampy habitats, often in coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Fimbristylis. This variant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
