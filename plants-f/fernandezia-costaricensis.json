    "intro": "Fernandezia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually pinnate and covered in fine, soft hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Fernandezia costaricensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
