    "intro": "Festuca squamulosa, commonly known as the squamulose fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with small, scale-like structures called squamulose. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca squamulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
