    "intro": "Feuilleea dominicensis, commonly known as the Island Leaf Plant, is a rare tropical species native to the Caribbean island of Dominica. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight iridescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
