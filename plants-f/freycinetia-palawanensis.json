    "intro": "Freycinetia palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan screw pine, is a unique plant native to the Philippines. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant has a thick, woody stem that is covered in a fibrous, spongy layer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Freycinetia palawanensis is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, making it a resilient species in tropical regions."
