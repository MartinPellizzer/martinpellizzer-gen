    "intro": "Ficus wardii, commonly known as the African rubber fig, is a tropical plant native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is a member of the Moraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-white fruits that are edible but often not consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying qualities. Ficus wardii is also valued for its adaptability and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
