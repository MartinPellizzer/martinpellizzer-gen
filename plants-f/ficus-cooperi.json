    "intro": "Ficus cooperi, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible figs, though these are not commonly consumed by humans. Ficus cooperi is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value."
