    "intro": "Ficus howii, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, spherical fruits that turn yellow or red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor conditions. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, making proper care essential for its health."
