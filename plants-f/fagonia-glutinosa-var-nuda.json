    "intro": "Fagonia glutinosa var. nuda, commonly known as the naked fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and branched, often thorny stems. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, red fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Fagonia glutinosa var. nuda is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
