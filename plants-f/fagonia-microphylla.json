It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Fagonia microphylla is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
