    "intro": "Festuca psammophila subsp. dominii, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its low-growing structure and drought tolerance make it an important component of stabilizing sandy environments."
