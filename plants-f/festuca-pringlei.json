    "intro": "Festuca pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pringlei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
