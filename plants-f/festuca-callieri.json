It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca callieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
