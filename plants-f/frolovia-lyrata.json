    "intro": "Frolovia lyrata, commonly known as the lyratic frostflower, is a rare perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble lace, and its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pale blue and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates. Its unique morphology includes a rosette growth pattern and a specialized root system that helps it retain moisture. Frolovia lyrata is of interest to botanists due to its potential medicinal properties and its role in high-altitude ecosystems."
