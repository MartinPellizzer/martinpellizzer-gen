It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The tree produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is well adapted to wetland environments and plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance in such habitats."
