    "intro": "Festuca hypsophila, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its foliage is often blue-green in color, which gives it its common name. Festuca hypsophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
