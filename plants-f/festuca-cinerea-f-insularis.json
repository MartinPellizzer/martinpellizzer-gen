    "intro": "Festuca cinerea f. insularis, commonly known as the Islandgray fescue, is a grass species native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in salty, wind-swept environments. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Festuca cinerea, distinguished by its unique coloration and ecological adaptations. It is often found in maritime climates, growing on dunes and rocky shores. Its resilience to harsh conditions makes it an important plant for stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
