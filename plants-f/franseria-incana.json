    "intro": "Franseria incana, commonly known as the silverleaf franseria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Franseria incana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
