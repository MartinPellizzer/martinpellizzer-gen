    "intro": "Fernandezia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Fernandezia lanceolata is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
