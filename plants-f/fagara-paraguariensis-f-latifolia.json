    "intro": "Fagara paraguariensis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved fagara, is a variant of the fagara plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
