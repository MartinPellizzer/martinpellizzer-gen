    "intro": "Ficus ciliolosa, commonly known as the silky fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible figs, which are typically clustered in spherical infructescences. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ficus ciliolosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate shade and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
