    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf European beech, is a rare and distinctive form of the European beech. It is characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical beech, which gives it a unique appearance. This variety is primarily found in specific regions of Europe, often in areas with particular microclimates. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath, and they turn a striking yellow in autumn. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
