    "intro": "Ficus forsteriana, commonly known as the Forster's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fig-like fruits that are encased in a greenish-brown husk, which ripens to a yellowish color. Ficus forsteriana thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and ornamental gardening."
