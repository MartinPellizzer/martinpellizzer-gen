    "intro": "Ficus carica var. caffra, commonly known as the Cape fig, is a variant of the common fig tree native to South Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, green figs that turn yellow or red when mature, containing a sweet, edible pulp surrounded by a fibrous husk. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a fruit-bearing plant in suitable climates."
