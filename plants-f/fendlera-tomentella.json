    "intro": "Fendlera tomentella, commonly known as the silky fendlera, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which provide a distinctive appearance and aid in reducing water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Fendlera tomentella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
