It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces compact inflorescences with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscaping projects."
