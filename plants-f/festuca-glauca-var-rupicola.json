    "intro": "Festuca glauca var. rupicola, commonly known as bluegrass or mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cooler climates with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
