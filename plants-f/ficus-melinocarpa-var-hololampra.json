    "intro": "Ficus melinocarpa var. hololampra, commonly known as the golden fig or the honey fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glossy green leaves and small, clustered yellowish-green fruits. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits, which have a sweet, honey-like flavor. The varietal name 'hololampra' refers to its striking golden coloration, which is more pronounced in the fruit than in the leaves."
