It features tall, narrow leaves that are often wavy or undulating, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor gardens."
