    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. nigrescens, commonly known as black muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark purple to black foliage, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, and it produces small, fluffy flower heads that are wind-pollinated. Festuca heterophylla var. nigrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
