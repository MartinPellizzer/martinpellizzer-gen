    "intro": "Fritillaria legionensis, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a robust, fleshy bulb that stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in its natural habitat."
