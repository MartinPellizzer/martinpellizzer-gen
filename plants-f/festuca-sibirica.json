    "intro": "Festuca sibirica, commonly known as Siberian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and other northern regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Festuca sibirica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
