    "intro": "Ficus mollissima, commonly known as the velvet fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Ficus mollissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
