It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer.
