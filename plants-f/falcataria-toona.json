    "intro": "Falcataria toona, commonly known as the white toon, is a tropical tree belonging to the Meliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, simple, and often palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the tree can grow up to 30 meters tall in its native habitat. Falcataria toona is valued for its timber and is often used in reforestation efforts due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
