    "intro": "Ficus itoana, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus itoana is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
