    "intro": "Freziera ekmanii, commonly known as the dwarf freziera, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
