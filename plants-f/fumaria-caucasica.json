    "intro": "Fumaria caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian smokeplant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Caucasus region. It features delicate, slender stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, with opposite, lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their two-lipped structure, typical of the Fumariaceae family. Fumaria caucasica is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges."
