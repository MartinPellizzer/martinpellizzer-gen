    "intro": "Festuca pontica, commonly known as Pontic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region and parts of southeastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with fine, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are small and often green or reddish in hue. Festuca pontica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
