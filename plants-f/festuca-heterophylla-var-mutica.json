    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. mutica, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, while the inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Festuca heterophylla var. mutica is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological value and ability to stabilize dune ecosystems."
