It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and large, simple, ovate leaves that are typically pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
