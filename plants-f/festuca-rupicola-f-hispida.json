    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. hispida, commonly known as the hispid rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, often hairy stems that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The leaves are narrow, rough, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, open panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry slopes, gravelly plains, and disturbed sites."
