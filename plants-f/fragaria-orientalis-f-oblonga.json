    "intro": "Fragaria orientalis f. oblonga, commonly known as the oriental strawberry, is a botanical variant of the oriental strawberry species. It is characterized by its elongated, oblong-shaped fruit, which differs from the typical round form of most strawberries. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are often smaller than those of the common garden strawberry. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial sunlight. This cultivar is valued for its unique fruit shape and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as for its edible berries."
