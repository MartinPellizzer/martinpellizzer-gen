    "intro": "Festuca villosa, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, wiry leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like clusters of grass-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Festuca villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
