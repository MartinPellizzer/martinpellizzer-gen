    "intro": "Ficus grewiifolia var. remblas, commonly known as the Remblas fig, is a variant of the Ficus grewiifolia species. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among indoor gardeners due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
