    "intro": "Festuca cavillieri, commonly known as the Alaskan fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca cavillieri has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
