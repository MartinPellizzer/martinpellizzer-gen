    "intro": "Fraxinus bracteata, commonly known as the green ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and compound leaves that are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruits are samaras, or winged seeds, that are dispersed by wind. The bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees."
