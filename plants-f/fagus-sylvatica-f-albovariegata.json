    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined European beech, is a striking variant of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its distinctive white and silver variegation on the leaves, which contrasts with the typical dark green foliage. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. This unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is less hardy than the common beech and requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
