    "intro": "Festuca gamisansii subsp. aethaliae, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
