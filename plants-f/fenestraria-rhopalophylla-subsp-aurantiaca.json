It features small, fleshy leaves with translucent windows that allow light to reach the chloroplasts for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
