    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. supinoides, commonly known as creeping sheep's fescue, is a low-growing grass species characterized by its prostrate growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming growth. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
