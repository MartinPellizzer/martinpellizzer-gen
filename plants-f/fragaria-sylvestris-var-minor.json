    "intro": "Fragaria sylvestris var. minor, commonly known as the wild strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are smaller and more intensely flavored than those of the cultivated strawberry. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas and along forest edges. Its botanical features make it a popular subject in horticulture and botanical studies."
