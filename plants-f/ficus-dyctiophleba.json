    "intro": "Ficus dyctiophleba, commonly known as the giant ficus, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of figs. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its adaptability, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in warm climates."
