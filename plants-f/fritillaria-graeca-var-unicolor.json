    "intro": "Fritillaria graeca var. unicolor, commonly known as the Greek dog's tooth tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing one to three flowers, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base that stores nutrients for the next growing season. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
