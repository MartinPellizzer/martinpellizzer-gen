    "intro": "Fendlera rupicola, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Fendlera rupicola is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert regions."
