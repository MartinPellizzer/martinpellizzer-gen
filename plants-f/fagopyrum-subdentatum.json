    "intro": "Fagopyrum subdentatum, commonly known as the Japanese buckwheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated or subdenticulate margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in a three-lobed, leathery capsule that matures in the fall. Fagopyrum subdentatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
