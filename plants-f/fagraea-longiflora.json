    "intro": "Fagraea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered fagraea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
