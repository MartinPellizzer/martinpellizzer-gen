    "intro": "Fagraea carnosa, commonly known as the white star tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. Fagraea carnosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to grow successfully."
