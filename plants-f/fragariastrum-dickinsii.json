    "intro": "Fragariastrum dickinsii, commonly known as the Dickinsii strawberry, is a rare and unique species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, edible berries that have a distinct flavor profile compared to common strawberries. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it produces white flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
