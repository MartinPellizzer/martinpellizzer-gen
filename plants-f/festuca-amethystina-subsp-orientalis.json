    "intro": "Festuca amethystina subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with blue or purple hues. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its neat, compact growth habit. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Festuca amethystina."
