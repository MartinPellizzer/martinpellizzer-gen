    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. saximontana, commonly known as the saximontana sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense foliage. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with silver or blue, adding a distinctive visual appeal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in cooler climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
