    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. polycolea, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it thrive in various soil types. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, with a prominent midrib, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Festuca ovina subsp. polycolea is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
