    "intro": "Fragaria collina var. soyeriana, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature, though they are often smaller and less flavorful than common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is typically cultivated in controlled environments rather than in open fields."
