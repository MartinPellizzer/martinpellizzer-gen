    "intro": "Fagonia arabica, commonly known as the desert henna or sand henna, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruiting bodies that contain toxic compounds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though caution is required due to its potential harmful effects. Fagonia arabica plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems by preventing soil erosion."
