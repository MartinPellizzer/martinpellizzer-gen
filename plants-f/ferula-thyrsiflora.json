    "intro": "Ferula thyrsiflora, commonly known as the Kashmiri ferula, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, contributing to its distinctive scent. Ferula thyrsiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual impact."
