    "intro": "Fragaria vesca subvar. hauchecornei, commonly known as the Hauchecorne strawberry, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the wild strawberry. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fragaria genus. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are often overlooked due to their modest size. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its genetic uniqueness and potential for breeding programs."
