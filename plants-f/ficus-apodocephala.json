    "intro": "Ficus apodocephala, commonly known as the small-leaved fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. Its fruit, known as a fig, is typically small and edible, though it is not as widely consumed as other fig species. Ficus apodocephala is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
