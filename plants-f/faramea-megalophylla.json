    "intro": "Faramea megalophylla, commonly known as the giant faramea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Faramea megalophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
