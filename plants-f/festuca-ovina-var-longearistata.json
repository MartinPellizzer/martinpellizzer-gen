    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. longearistata, commonly known as the longawn sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a distinctive elongated base that gives it its scientific name. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
