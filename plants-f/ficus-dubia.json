    "intro": "Ficus dubia, commonly known as the rare fig tree, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when immature and turn yellow or red when ripe. Ficus dubia is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other ficus species."
