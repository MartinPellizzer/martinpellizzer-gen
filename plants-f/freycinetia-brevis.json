    "intro": "Freycinetia brevis, commonly known as the short-leaf freycinetia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Pandanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Freycinetia brevis is typically grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
