    "intro": "Festuca cinerea subf. aversa, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland margins. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to greenish flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The subspecies aversa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and reduced leaf density compared to other forms of Festuca cinerea."
