It features fine, silver-blue foliage that is densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
