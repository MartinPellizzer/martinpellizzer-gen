    "intro": "Fagonia scoparia, commonly known as desert fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody, branched stems that are adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Fagonia scoparia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
