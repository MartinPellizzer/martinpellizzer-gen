    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash or rostrated ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically green in summer and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. This variety is well-suited for smaller landscapes due to its compact growth and adaptability to various soil types."
