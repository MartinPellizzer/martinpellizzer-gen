    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. austini-megaphylla, commonly known as the Austini-Megaphylla green ash, is a variant of the green ash tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 4 to 8 inches long and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it often exhibits a pyramidal or irregular shape. This variety is adapted to a range of soil types and is often found in moist, woodland habitats."
