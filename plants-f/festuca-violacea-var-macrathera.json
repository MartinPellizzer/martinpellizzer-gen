    "intro": "Festuca violacea var. macrathera, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that typically grow between 30 and 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces dense, dark green foliage with a bluish tinge, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often tinged with purple or violet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and color."
