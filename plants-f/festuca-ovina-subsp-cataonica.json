    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. cataonica, commonly known as the Cataonic sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
