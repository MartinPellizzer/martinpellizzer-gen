    "intro": "Filipendula kiraishiensis, commonly known as the Kiraishi meadow sweet, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into cylindrical seed heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Filipendula kiraishiensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
