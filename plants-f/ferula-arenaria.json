    "intro": "Ferula arenaria, commonly known as the desert cowparsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a umbel. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Ferula arenaria is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
