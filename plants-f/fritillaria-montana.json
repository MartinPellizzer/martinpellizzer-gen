    "intro": "Fritillaria montana, commonly known as the Sierra lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high elevations, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its stem is usually unbranched and erect. Fritillaria montana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
