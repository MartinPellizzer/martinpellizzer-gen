    "intro": "Festuca rubra proles multiflora, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Festuca rubra proles multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a low-maintenance turf."
