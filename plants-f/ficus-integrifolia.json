    "intro": "Ficus integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically smooth and entire. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ficus integrifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
