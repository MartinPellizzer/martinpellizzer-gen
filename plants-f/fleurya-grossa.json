    "intro": "Fleurya grossa, commonly known as the broad-leafed fleurya, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Fleurya grossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
