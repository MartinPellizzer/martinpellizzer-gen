    "intro": "Fritillaria crassifolia var. hermonis, commonly known as the Hermon fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or red with contrasting black markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
