    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. laeviglumis, commonly known as the smoothleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
