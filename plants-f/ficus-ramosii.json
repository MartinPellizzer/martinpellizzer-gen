    "intro": "Ficus ramosii, commonly known as the Chinese banyan or small-leaf banyan, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spreading canopy and aerial roots that help it climb and anchor itself to other trees. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a pointed tip. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by round, greenish fruits that turn yellow when mature. Ficus ramosii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
