    "intro": "Frondaria, commonly known as the \"butterfly fern,\" is a unique genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. These fronds are typically bi-lobed and resemble the wings of butterflies, giving the plant its evocative common name. Frondaria thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's reproductive structures are concealed within specialized leaf bases, which protect the spores until they are ready to be dispersed. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
