    "intro": "Ficinia ecklonea, commonly known as the Cape fescue, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce minute flowers that are wind-pollinated. Ficinia ecklonea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
