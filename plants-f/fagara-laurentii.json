    "intro": "Fagara laurentii, commonly known as the Jamaican laurier or black laurier, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value comes from its dense, compact growth and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Fagara laurentii is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and aromatherapy."
