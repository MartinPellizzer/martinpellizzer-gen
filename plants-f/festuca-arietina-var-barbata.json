    "intro": "Festuca arietina var. barbata, commonly known as the barbed goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a distinctive barbed appearance on the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in erosion control and as a forage plant in arid environments."
