    "intro": "Franca, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the genus Fraxinus in the olive family, Oleaceae. The plant is characterized by its dense, almost round crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind."
