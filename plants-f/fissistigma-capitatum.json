    "intro": "Fissistigma capitatum, commonly known as the clustered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It is native to parts of Africa and is often found in humid, forested areas. The berries it produces are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal."
