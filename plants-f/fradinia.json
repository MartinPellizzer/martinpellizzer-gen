It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often form umbels, and its leaves are typically pinnately divided. The plant is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Fradinia species are known for their ornamental value due to their unique, lantern-like seed pods. They are generally easy to cultivate and thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade."
