    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland, meadows, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
