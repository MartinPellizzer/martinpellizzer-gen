    "intro": "Fritillaria ariana, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are upright and bear the showy flowers. Fritillaria ariana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
