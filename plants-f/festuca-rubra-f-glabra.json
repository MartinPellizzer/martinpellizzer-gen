The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which appear in late summer. Its leaves are smooth and hairless, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other fescue varieties. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
