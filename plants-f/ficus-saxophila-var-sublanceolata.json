    "intro": "Ficus saxophila var. sublanceolata, commonly known as the sublanceolate fig, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green to yellowish in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and specific growing conditions, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
