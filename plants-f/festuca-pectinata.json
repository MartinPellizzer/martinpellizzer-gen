    "intro": "Festuca pectinata, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca pectinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer."
