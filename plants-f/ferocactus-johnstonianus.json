    "intro": "Ferocactus johnstonianus, commonly known as the Johnston's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by fruit that contains edible seeds. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Ferocactus johnstonianus is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient plant in its natural habitat."
