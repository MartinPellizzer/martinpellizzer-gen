    "intro": "Ferula pimenovii, commonly known as the Pimenov's giant fennel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, feathery leaves that resemble those of other members of the carrot family. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Ferula pimenovii is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
