    "intro": "Fraxinus grandifolia, commonly known as the largeleaf ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are often larger than those of other ash species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. Its root system is relatively shallow, making it susceptible to windthrow, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Fraxinus grandifolia plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
