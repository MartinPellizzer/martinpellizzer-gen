    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. gaetula, commonly known as the red fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features fine, needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a bluish-gray hue under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its dense growth habit helps prevent erosion and provides habitat for small insects and birds."
