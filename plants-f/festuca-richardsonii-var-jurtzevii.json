    "intro": "Festuca richardsonii var. jurtzevii, commonly known as the Richardson\u2019s fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, dark green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is valued in restoration projects and native landscaping."
