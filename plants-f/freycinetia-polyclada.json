    "intro": "Freycinetia polyclada, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its large, broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and cuisine. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish flowers followed by fleshy, red or orange berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense thickets in moist, coastal environments. Freycinetia polyclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in many island communities."
