    "intro": "Frailea pygmaea var. pulcherrima, commonly known as the Pink Fairy Cactus, is a compact, branching cactus native to southern Africa. It features small, cylindrical stems that are typically pink to reddish in color, often adorned with white to pink spines. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pink, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
