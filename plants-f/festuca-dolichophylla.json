    "intro": "Festuca dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Festuca dolichophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
