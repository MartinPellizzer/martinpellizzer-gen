    "intro": "Festuca sulcata var. wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for use in dry landscapes and as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and ability to form a lush, low-maintenance lawn."
