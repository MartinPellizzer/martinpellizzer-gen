    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior proles australis, commonly known as the European ash, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and serrated leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and is often found in mixed forests. The bark is smooth when young but becomes fissured with age, and the wood is valued for its strength and workability."
