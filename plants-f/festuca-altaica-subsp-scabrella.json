    "intro": "Festuca altaica subsp. scabrella, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold and arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects in suitable climates."
