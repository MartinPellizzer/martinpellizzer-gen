    "intro": "Festuca caprina var. macra, commonly known as the tall sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. It is often used in ornamental landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological value in supporting pollinators."
