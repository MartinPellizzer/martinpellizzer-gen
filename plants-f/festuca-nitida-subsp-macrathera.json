    "intro": "Festuca nitida subsp. macrathera, commonly known as silverhair fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca nitida subsp. macrathera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
