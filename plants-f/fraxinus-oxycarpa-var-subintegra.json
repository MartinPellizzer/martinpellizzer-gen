    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa var. subintegra, commonly known as the Sierra Madre ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are often retained longer into the winter compared to other ash species, and it is adapted to dry, rocky soils in its native habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
