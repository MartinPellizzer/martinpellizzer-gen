    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. nigrescens, commonly known as red fescue var. darkening, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its dark green foliage. It is a low-growing, tufted perennial that typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass and landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability. The dark green coloration of its leaves is a distinguishing feature of this particular form."
