    "intro": "Fragaria caroliniensis, commonly known as the Carolina strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small red berry, develops in late summer and is edible, though less flavorful than the cultivated strawberry. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
