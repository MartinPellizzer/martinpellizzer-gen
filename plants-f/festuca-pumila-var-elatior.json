    "intro": "Festuca pumila var. elatior, commonly known as the tall alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces slender, blue-green blades with a fine texture, and its compact growth habit makes it ideal for erosion control in alpine settings. It is often found in alpine meadows and on slopes, where it forms dense, resilient ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and horticultural use in specialized gardens."
