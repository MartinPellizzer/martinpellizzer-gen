    "intro": "Festuca rupicola subsp. brunnescens, commonly known as the brownish mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a pale to dark green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in rocky or difficult soils."
