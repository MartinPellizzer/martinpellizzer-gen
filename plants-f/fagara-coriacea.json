    "intro": "Fagara coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved soursop, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a fruit that is typically spiny and resembles a soursop, though it is not closely related to the true soursop. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Fagara coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
