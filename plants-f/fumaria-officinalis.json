    "intro": "Fumaria officinalis, commonly known as common fumitory, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiral-shaped seed pods that contain numerous tiny, dark seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Fumaria officinalis has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and detoxifying properties."
