    "intro": "Ficus storckii, commonly known as the Storck's fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are encased in a tough, fibrous husk. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Ficus storckii is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
