    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. timbalii, commonly known as Timbal's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and poor soil quality. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience in alpine ecosystems."
