    "intro": "Fagara mauiensis var. anceps, commonly known as the Maui fern tree, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fern-like foliage and woody structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the native forests of Hawaii. Its leaves are compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and it produces small, white flowers followed by red berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
