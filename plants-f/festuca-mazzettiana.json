    "intro": "Festuca mazzettiana, commonly known as Mazzetti's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca mazzettiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and hardy nature."
