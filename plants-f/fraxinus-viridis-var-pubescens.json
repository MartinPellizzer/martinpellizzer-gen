    "intro": "Fraxinus viridis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent green ash, is a variant of the green ash tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, finely pubescent (hairy) leaves that are typically a vibrant green on both sides. The leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib. This variety produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions."
