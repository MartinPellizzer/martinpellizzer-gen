    "intro": "Funkia ovata var. albopicta, commonly known as the white-veined daylily, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features striking, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often white-veined, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and wetlands. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense clumps over time."
