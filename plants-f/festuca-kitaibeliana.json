    "intro": "Festuca kitaibeliana, commonly known as Kitaibel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca kitaibeliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or arid landscapes."
