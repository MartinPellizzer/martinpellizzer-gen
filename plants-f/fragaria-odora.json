    "intro": "Fragaria odora, commonly known as the sweet william strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they are smaller and less flavorful than common garden strawberries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Its unique scent and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for both decorative and culinary purposes."
