    "intro": "Festuca pulchella var. jurana, commonly known as the Jurana bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which appear in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
