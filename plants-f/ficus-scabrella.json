    "intro": "Ficus scabrella, commonly known as the rough fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a distinctive rough, raised texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits. Its root system is extensive and can be used for soil stabilization in erosion-prone areas. Ficus scabrella is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in humid, warm climates with indirect sunlight."
