    "intro": "Festuca alopecuroides, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to eastern North America. It features fine, blue-green blades that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to silver-green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
