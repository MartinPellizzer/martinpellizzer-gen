    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. molinieri, commonly known as Molinier's sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy slopes, meadows, and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
