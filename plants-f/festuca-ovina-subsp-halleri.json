    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. halleri, commonly known as Haller's sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
