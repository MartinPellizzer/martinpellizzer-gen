    "intro": "Fagraea tubulosa, commonly known as the white-flowered glorybower, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Fagraea tubulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
