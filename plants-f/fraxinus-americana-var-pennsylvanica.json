    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. pennsylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 feet, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, green, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, winged samaras that disperse by wind, aiding in its propagation."
