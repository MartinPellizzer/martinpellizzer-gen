    "intro": "Ficus ilicina, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, waxy leaves. The plant has thick, dark green foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically consumed by humans. Ficus ilicina is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
