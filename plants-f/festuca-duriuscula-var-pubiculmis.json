    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. pubiculmis, commonly known as the pubescent fescue, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
