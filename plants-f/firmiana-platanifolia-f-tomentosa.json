    "intro": "Firmiana platanifolia f. tomentosa, commonly known as the silky sycamore or silky maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to provide shade in urban and suburban landscapes."
