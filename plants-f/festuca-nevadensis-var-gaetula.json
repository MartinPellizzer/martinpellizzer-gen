    "intro": "Festuca nevadensis var. gaetula, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fescue, is a perennial grass native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 8,000 feet. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
