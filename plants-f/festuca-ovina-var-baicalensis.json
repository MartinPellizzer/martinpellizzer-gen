    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. baicalensis, commonly known as Baikal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
