    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. cretacea, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky or dry soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine and coastal environments due to its tolerance of harsh conditions. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive turf-like cover."
