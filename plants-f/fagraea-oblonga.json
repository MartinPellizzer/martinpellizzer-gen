It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green foliage and striking clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. Fagraea oblonga is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and attractive foliage.
