    "intro": "Frenela robusta var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited robust frenel, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red upon maturity. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its resilience, it is often used in coastal vegetation restoration projects."
