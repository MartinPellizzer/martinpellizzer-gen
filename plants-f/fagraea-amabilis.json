    "intro": "Fagraea amabilis, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and can grow up to 15 cm in length. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fagraea amabilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
