    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. trachyphylla, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are usually arranged in compact clusters, with small, awned flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
