    "intro": "Fraxinus nana, commonly known as the dwarf ash, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring a compact, multi-stemmed form. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are serrated along the edges. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a samara, a winged seed that aids in wind dispersal."
