    "intro": "Funkia liliifolia, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and emerge from rhizomatous stems. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Funkia liliifolia is valued in landscaping for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
