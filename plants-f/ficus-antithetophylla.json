    "intro": "Ficus antithetophylla, commonly known as the antithetophylla fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs that are often consumed by local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
