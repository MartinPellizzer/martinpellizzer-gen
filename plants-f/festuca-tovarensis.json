    "intro": "Festuca tovarensis, commonly known as Tovar grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded grassland habitats."
