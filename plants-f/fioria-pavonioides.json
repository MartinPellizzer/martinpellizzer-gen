    "intro": "Fioria pavonioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season. Fioria pavonioides is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
