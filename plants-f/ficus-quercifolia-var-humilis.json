    "intro": "Ficus quercifolia var. humilis, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Ficus quercifolia. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and indirect sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
