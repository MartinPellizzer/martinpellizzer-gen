    "intro": "Fagelia hartwegii, commonly known as Hartweg's fagelia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Fagaceae, which includes oaks and beeches. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and produces small, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. Fagelia hartwegii is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited scientific study."
