    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. oelandica, commonly known as the Oeland meadow grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to parts of Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and flowering spikes that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging wetland environments."
