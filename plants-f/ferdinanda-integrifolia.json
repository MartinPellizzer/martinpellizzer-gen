    "intro": "Ferdinanda integrifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered milk tree, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments."
