This plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaf structure is composed of a single, undivided frond that exhibits a delicate, feathery texture. Feuilleea unifoliolata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories.
