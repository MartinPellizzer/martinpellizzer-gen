    "intro": "Franklinia, commonly known as Franklinia alatamaha, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its attractive, urn-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are oval and evergreen, providing a dense canopy. Unfortunately, Franklinia is now considered extinct in the wild, with only a few cultivated specimens remaining."
