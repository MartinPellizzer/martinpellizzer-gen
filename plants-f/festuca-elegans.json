    "intro": "Festuca elegans, commonly known as bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, forming dense, low-growing lawns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Festuca elegans is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
