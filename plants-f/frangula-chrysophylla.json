    "intro": "Frangula chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which turns red in the fall, making it a visually distinctive plant. The species belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes other aromatic plants such as citrus and buckthorn. Its small, dark blue berries are edible but typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
