    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. maritima, commonly known as sea sheepgrass, is a coastal grass species adapted to harsh maritime environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. Festuca ovina var. maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
