    "intro": "Freycinetia strobilacea, commonly known as the cycad fern or the cycad-like plant, is a unique species belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, featuring a stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
