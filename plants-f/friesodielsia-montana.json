    "intro": "Friesodielsia montana, commonly known as the mountain friesodielsia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
