    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes subsp. rostii, commonly known as the Mexican horsehair cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
