    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. juglandifolia, commonly known as the hazelnut white ash, is a variant of the American ash tree characterized by its unique foliage. It features broad, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface that turns yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in eastern North America."
