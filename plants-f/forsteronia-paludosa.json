    "intro": "Forsteronia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh forsteria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and marshes. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Forsteronia paludosa plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
