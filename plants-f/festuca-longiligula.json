    "intro": "Festuca longiligula, commonly known as the long-leaved fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and woodlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Festuca longiligula is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
