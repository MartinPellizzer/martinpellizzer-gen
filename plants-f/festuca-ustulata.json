    "intro": "Festuca ustulata, commonly known as the scorched fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions. Its flowering spikes are typically pale green to golden in color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca ustulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
