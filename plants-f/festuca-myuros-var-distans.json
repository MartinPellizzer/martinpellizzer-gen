It is characterized by its fine, upright blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late spring to early summer. Festuca myuros var. distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
