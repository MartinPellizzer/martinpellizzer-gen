    "intro": "Ferreyranthus vernonioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Its hardy nature makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, providing a unique texture and visual interest in garden settings."
