    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica f. megaphylla, commonly known as the Florida ash, is a variant of the green ash tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical green ash, which are often described as having a more pronounced, elongated shape. The leaves are typically a dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a smooth margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
