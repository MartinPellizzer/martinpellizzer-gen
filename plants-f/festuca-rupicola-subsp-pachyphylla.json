    "intro": "Festuca rupicola subsp. pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and dark green, thick, and leathery leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
