    "intro": "Fracastora alpestris, commonly known as the alpine fraxinella, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are tiny and greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Fracastora alpestris is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine habitats."
