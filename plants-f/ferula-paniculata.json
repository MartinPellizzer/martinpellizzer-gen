    "intro": "Ferula paniculata, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile compounds such as anethole and fenchone. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of parsley, contributing to its common name. Ferula paniculata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
