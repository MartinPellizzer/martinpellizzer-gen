    "intro": "Ficus prinoides var. genuina, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a compact, slow-growing species native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly variegated appearance. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits, though these are not typically consumed by humans. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored ornamental plant."
