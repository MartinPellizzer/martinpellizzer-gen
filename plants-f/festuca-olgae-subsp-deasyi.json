    "intro": "Festuca olgae subsp. deasyi, commonly known as Deasy's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant typically blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce pale to dark blue flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in high-altitude environments with low nutrient availability. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
