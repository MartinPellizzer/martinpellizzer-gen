    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. minor, commonly known as the rock grass or dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
