It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green foliage, which is often used in ornamental landscaping. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, requiring minimal maintenance. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that add visual interest during the spring and summer months."
