    "intro": "Frankenia reuteri, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salty sea air and sandy soils. Frankenia reuteri is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of drought and salt spray."
