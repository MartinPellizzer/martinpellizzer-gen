    "intro": "Ficus caprificus, commonly known as the small-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus caprificus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
