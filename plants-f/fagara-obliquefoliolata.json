    "intro": "Fagara obliquefoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fagara, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in the understory of humid forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that are arranged in an alternate pattern. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or greenish-white, and it produces berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals."
