    "intro": "Ferula lancerotensis, commonly known as the Lancerote fennel, is a rare endemic plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and tall, branched inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the island's unique climate and soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a strong, pungent odor, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
