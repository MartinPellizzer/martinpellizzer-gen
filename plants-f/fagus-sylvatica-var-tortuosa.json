    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted European beech, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European beech. It is characterized by its irregular, twisted trunk and branches, which give it a unique, almost otherworldly appearance. This variation is primarily the result of natural genetic mutations and environmental factors. The leaves are typically dark green and glossy, similar to those of the standard European beech. It is often found in shaded, moist forest environments where it can thrive without competition from other species."
