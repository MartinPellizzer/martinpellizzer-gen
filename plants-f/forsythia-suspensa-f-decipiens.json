    "intro": "Forsythia suspensa f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive forsythia, is a variant of the common forsythia, characterized by its unique floral morphology. This plant is a deciduous shrub native to China, known for its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The \"decipiens\" form exhibits a distinctive trait where the flowers appear to be fully open but are actually in a closed, bud-like state, creating a deceptive visual effect. Botanically, it possesses opposite, simple leaves and produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Its ornamental value lies in its unusual floral display, making it a sought-after plant in horticulture."
