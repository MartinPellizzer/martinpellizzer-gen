    "intro": "Feuilleea coccinea, commonly known as the Crimson Leaf Plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which becomes even more intense under direct sunlight. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface. Feuilleea coccinea thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its sensitivity to direct heat and cold."
