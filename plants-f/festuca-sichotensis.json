    "intro": "Festuca sichotensis, commonly known as the Sichotengrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Festuca sichotensis produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
