    "intro": "Fibraurea elliptica, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a straight, cylindrical trunk with a smooth, dark bark. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Fibraurea elliptica is well adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its hard, heavy wood is valued for construction and traditional uses."
