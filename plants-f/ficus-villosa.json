    "intro": "Ficus villosa, commonly known as the hairy fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus villosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
