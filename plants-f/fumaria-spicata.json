    "intro": "Fumaria spicata, commonly known as the spiked glory of the field, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fumariaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, spiky seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often overlooked member of the flora in its native range."
