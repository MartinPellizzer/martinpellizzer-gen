    "intro": "Forcipella involucrata, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant that belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habit, with specialized structures called bladders that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its bladders for nutrient acquisition. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
