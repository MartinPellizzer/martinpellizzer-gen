    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjevic fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
