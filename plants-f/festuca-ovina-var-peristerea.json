    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. peristerea, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy choice for erosion control. Its low maintenance requirements and drought tolerance further contribute to its popularity in both natural and cultivated settings."
