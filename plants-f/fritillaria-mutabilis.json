    "intro": "Fritillaria mutabilis, commonly known as the Turk's cap lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, purple, and even red, often changing hue as they bloom. The plant produces a cluster of showy, upward-facing blooms on a sturdy stem, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically appearing after the flowers have faded. Fritillaria mutabilis is well-suited for rock gardens and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
