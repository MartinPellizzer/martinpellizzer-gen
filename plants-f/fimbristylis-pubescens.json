It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Fimbristylis pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
