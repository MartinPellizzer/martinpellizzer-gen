    "intro": "Ficus confertifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact cluster. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus confertifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
