It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
