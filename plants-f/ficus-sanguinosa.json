    "intro": "Ficus sanguinosa, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, greenish-white fruits. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus sanguinosa is also valued for its air-purifying properties and adaptability to indoor environments."
