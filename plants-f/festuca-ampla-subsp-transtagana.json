    "intro": "Festuca ampla subsp. transtagana, commonly known as the Trans-Tatra fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
