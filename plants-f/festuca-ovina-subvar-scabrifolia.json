    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. scabrifolia, commonly known as roughleaf sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in alpine meadows, dry slopes, and disturbed soils due to its drought tolerance and adaptability. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects and native landscaping."
