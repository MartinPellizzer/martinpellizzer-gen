    "intro": "Fumaria bastardii var. jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's fumitory, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small,\u692d\u5706\u5f62 seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
