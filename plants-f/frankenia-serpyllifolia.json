    "intro": "Frankenia serpyllifolia, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, salty environments. The plant produces small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune habitats. Frankenia serpyllifolia is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
