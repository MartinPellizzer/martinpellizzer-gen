    "intro": "Festuca cleefiana, commonly known as Cleef's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca cleefiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and resilient nature."
