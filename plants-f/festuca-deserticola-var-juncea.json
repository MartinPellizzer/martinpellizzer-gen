    "intro": "Festuca deserticola var. juncea, commonly known as desert bluegrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to thrive in poor soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Festuca deserticola var. juncea is often found in desert scrub and sand dune ecosystems, playing a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
