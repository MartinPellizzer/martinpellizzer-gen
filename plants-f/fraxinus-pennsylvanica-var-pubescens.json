    "intro": "Fraxinus pennsylvanica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Southern ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its compound leaves, which are opposite and have 7 to 13 leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that disperses by wind, contributing to its natural spread. The tree is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, well-drained habitats."
