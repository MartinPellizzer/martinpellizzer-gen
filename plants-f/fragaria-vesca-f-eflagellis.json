    "intro": "Fragaria vesca f. eflagellis, commonly known as the flagellate strawberry, is a botanical variant of the wild strawberry. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted fruit pedicels, which give it its name. The plant retains the typical features of Fragaria vesca, including its trifoliate leaves and small, edible berries. It is primarily found in temperate regions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
