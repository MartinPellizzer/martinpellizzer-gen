    "intro": "Festuca rupicola var. coziae, commonly known as Cozze\u2019s rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
