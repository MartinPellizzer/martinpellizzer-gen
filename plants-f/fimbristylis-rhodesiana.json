It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it forms dense, grass-like clumps. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
