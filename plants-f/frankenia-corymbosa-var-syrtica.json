    "intro": "Frankenia corymbosa var. syrtica, commonly known as the coastal frankenia, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Frankenia corymbosa var. syrtica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
