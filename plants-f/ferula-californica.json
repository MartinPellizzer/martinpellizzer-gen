    "intro": "Ferula californica, commonly known as the California cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a tall, slender stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and silvery-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fibrous, and the plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Ferula californica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal practices."
