    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. durissima, commonly known as hard sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
