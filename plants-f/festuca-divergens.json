    "intro": "Festuca divergens, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca divergens is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
