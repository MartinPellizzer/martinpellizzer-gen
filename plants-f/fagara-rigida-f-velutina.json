    "intro": "Fagara rigida f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet-leafed fagara, is a variant of the Fagara rigida species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often producing fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
