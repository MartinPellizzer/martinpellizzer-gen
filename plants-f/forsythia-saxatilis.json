    "intro": "Forsythia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock forsythia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, turning a deep green during the growing season."
