    "intro": "Fuerstia ternata, commonly known as the three-leaved euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often trifoliate, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a cyathium, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stem is typically branched and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Fuerstia ternata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in regions with low rainfall."
