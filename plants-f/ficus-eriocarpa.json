    "intro": "Ficus eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits. The woody structure of the plant makes it suitable for indoor cultivation, though it requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
