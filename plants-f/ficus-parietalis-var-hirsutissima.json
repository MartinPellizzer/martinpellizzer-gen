    "intro": "Ficus parietalis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy wall fig, is a rare and less commonly cultivated species within the Ficus genus. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other ficus varieties. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to rock surfaces or trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Despite its unique appearance, it is not widely available in commercial horticulture, making it a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts."
