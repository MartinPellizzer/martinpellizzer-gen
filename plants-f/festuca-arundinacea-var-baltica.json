    "intro": "Festuca arundinacea var. baltica, commonly known as Baltic tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, coarse stems and dark green, narrow leaves. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in forage production and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth. The plant produces dense, tufted inflorescences that contain small, spike-like flowers."
