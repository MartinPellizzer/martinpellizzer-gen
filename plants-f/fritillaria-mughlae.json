It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a central bulb. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
