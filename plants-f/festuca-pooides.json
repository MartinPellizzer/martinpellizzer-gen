    "intro": "Festuca pooides, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Festuca pooides produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in natural habitats."
