    "intro": "Festuca haenkei var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features fine, tufted blades with a distinctive blue-green hue, which is due to its high chlorophyll content. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
