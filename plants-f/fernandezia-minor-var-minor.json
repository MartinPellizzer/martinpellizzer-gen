It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
