    "intro": "Fritillaria conica, commonly known as the Crown Imperial, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, red, and even purple. The plant produces a tall, upright stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, crowned with a cluster of large, showy flowers. Its bulbs are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it important to handle with care. Fritillaria conica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
