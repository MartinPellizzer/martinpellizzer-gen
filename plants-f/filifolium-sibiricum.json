    "intro": "Filifolium sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian filifolium, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a bluish-green hue that helps it withstand harsh climates. Filifolium sibiricum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments."
