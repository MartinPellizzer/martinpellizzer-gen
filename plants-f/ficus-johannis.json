    "intro": "Ficus johannis, commonly known as the Johannes fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus johannis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
