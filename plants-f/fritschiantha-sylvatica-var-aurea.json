It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring and early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
