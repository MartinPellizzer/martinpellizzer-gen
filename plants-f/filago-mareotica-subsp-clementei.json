It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
