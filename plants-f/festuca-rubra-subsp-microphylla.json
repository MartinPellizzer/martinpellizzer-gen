    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. microphylla, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, low-growing growth habit. The plant typically forms tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is widely used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
