It features small, waxy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with succulent, dark green leaves that are somewhat fleshy. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
