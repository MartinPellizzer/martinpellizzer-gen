    "intro": "Ficus columnaris, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, columnar trunk and cascading clusters of small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
