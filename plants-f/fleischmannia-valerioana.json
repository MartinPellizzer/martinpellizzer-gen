    "intro": "Fleischmannia valerioana, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds. Fleischmannia valerioana is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
