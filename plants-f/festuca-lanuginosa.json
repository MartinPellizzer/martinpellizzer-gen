    "intro": "Festuca lanuginosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Festuca lanuginosa is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for various insect and bird species."
