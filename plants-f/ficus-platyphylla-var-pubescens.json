It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters in cultivation. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a broad, ovate shape with a slightly wavy margin. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage."
