    "intro": "Filix patula, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dark green, leathery, and often slightly hairy fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Filix patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, evergreen foliage."
