    "intro": "Festuca purpurea, commonly known as purple false brome, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Festuca purpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
