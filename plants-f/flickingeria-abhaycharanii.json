    "intro": "Flickingeria abhaycharanii, commonly known as the Abhaycharan's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the dense, humid forests of northeastern India. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf and blooms during the monsoon season. Its flowers are small, measuring approximately 1\u20132 centimeters in diameter, and are arranged in a loose, terminal inflorescence. Due to its restricted habitat and limited population, Flickingeria abhaycharanii is considered a critically endangered species, requiring urgent conservation efforts."
