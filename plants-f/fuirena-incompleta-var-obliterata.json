    "intro": "Fuirena incompleta var. obliterata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, pale green or white flowers that lack petals, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
