    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca f. arida, commonly known as the arid festuca, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread and colonize rocky or sandy soils effectively. This subspecies is often found in alpine and steppe environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
