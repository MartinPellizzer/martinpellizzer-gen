    "intro": "Fimbristylis trichoides, commonly known as the hairy bristlegrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats or tufts, often found in wet or seasonally flooded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, clustered flowers. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Fimbristylis trichoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
