    "intro": "Filix-mas \u00d7 dowellii, commonly known as the cross between the common horsetail and the Dowell's horsetail, is a hybrid fern that exhibits characteristics of both parent species. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant has a tall, slender stem with whorled branches, and its leaves are typically small and needle-like. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila at the tips of the branches. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland habitats."
