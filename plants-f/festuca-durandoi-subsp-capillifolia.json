    "intro": "Festuca durandoi subsp. capillifolia, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered with short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Festuca durandoi subsp. capillifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
