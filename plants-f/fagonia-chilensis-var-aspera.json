    "intro": "Fagonia chilensis var. aspera, commonly known as the Chilean fagonia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, woody fruits containing a single seed. It is adapted to survive in dry, saline soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. Its botanical features make it an important plant in the study of desert flora and ecological resilience."
