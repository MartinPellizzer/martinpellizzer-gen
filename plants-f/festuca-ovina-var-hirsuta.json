    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to cooler climates and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
