    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. capillata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. Festuca ovina subsp. capillata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
