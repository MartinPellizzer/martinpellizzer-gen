    "intro": "Furcraea demouliniana, commonly known as the Demoulin's sword fern, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant is adapted to dry climates, featuring a thick, fibrous root system and a waxy leaf surface to reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, spathaceous fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in warm, dry environments."
