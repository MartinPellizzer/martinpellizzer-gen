    "intro": "Ficus millingtonifolia, commonly known as the Millington's fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, greenish-yellow figs that mature to a reddish color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
