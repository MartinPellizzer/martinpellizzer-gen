    "intro": "Fagelia nana, commonly known as the dwarf fagelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, decorative shrub."
