    "intro": "Fuirena chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-stemmed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often submerged stems and small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates using specialized bladder-like structures. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface. Fuirena chlorocarpa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it can efficiently capture prey."
