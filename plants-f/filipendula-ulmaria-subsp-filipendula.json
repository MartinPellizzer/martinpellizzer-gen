It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the plant often grows in moist meadows and along stream banks. It produces a distinctive, aromatic, and slightly bitter scent, particularly when the leaves are crushed. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
