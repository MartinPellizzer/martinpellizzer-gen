    "intro": "Fimbristylis squarrosa subsp. esquarrosa, commonly known as the woolly sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
