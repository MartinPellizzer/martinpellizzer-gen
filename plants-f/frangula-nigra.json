    "intro": "Frangula nigra, commonly known as Canadian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Frangula nigra is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
