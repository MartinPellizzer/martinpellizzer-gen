It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, typical of the olive family. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed that aids in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
