    "intro": "Festuca malyi, commonly known as Maly's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Festuca malyi thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
