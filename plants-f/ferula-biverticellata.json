    "intro": "Ferula biverticellata, commonly known as the two-branched ferula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compound umbels of small, white flowers. The plant produces a strong-smelling, aromatic resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant thrives in dry, rocky soils, often growing in Mediterranean climates."
