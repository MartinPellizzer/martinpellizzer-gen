    "intro": "Fuertesimalva jacens, commonly known as the creeping wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green or reddish in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Fuertesimalva jacens is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in horticultural settings."
