    "intro": "Ferula arenosa, commonly known as the desert cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. Ferula arenosa is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its resinous sap has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a source of natural gum and in traditional medicine."
