    "intro": "Ferula drudeana, commonly known as the Persian cow's milk, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fibrous, containing a resinous sap that has been used in traditional medicine. Ferula drudeana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
