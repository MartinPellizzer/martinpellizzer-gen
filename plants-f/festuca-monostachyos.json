    "intro": "Festuca monostachyos, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Festuca monostachyos is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and environmental adaptability."
