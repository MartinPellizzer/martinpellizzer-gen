    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ash, is a subspecies native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal growth habit and its finely toothed, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by winged samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is less common than other ash species."
