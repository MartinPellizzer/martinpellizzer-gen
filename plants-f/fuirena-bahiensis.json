    "intro": "Fuirena bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahamian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant is typically found growing in coastal areas and moist soils, often along the edges of mangrove forests. Its vines can climb or trail along the ground, and the leaves are heart-shaped with a rough texture. Fuirena bahiensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
