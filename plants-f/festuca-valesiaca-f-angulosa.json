It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf sheaths, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca valesiaca f. angulosa is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
