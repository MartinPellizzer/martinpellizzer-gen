    "intro": "Ficus subpuberula, commonly known as the pubescent fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Ficus subpuberula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
