    "intro": "Festuca scirpifolia var. glyceriantha, commonly known as the glyceriantha fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
