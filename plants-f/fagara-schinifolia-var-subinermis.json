It is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by elliptical, dark blue to black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of humid forests. The botanical features of this plant make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
