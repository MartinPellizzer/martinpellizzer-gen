    "intro": "Ficus similis, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indoor conditions with moderate light and regular watering. However, it can be toxic to pets if ingested, making it important to keep it out of reach of animals."
