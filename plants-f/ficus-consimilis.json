    "intro": "Ficus consimilis, commonly known as the weeping fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish color. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments. However, it can be sensitive to changes in temperature and light, requiring careful maintenance to prevent leaf drop."
