    "intro": "Freirea ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori freirea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Rwenzori Mountains in eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
