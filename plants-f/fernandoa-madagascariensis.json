It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Fernandoa madagascariensis is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
