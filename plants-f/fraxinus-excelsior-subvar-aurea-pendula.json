It is characterized by its pendulous branches and distinctive golden-yellow foliage that turns amber in autumn. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, silky texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This variety is often cultivated in parks and gardens for its aesthetic value and shade-providing capabilities."
