    "intro": "Festuca wallichiana, commonly known as Himalayan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Festuca wallichiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
