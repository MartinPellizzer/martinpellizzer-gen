    "intro": "Festuca barrelieri, commonly known as Barrelier's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Festuca barrelieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
