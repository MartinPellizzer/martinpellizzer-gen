    "intro": "Ficus populnea subvar. typica, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that mature to a reddish color. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ability to thrive indoors with moderate light and regular watering. The species is also valued for its rubber-like latex, which has been historically used in various industrial applications."
