    "intro": "Ficus squamosa, commonly known as the silver fig or glossy fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus squamosa is also popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and adaptability to indoor conditions."
