    "intro": "Flueggea suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub-like species that typically grows in coastal and desert environments, often as a hemiparasitic plant, deriving some of its nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can survive prolonged drought periods."
