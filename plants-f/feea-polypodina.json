    "intro": "Feea polypodina, commonly known as the red-stemmed polypod, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Feea polypodina is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
