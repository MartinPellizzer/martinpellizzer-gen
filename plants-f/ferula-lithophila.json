    "intro": "Ferula lithophila, commonly known as the Lithuanian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin that is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Ferula lithophila thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs and slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of alpine flora and medicinal plant resources."
