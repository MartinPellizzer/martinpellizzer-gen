    "intro": "Filipendula ulmaria f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent meadow sweet, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of Filipendula ulmaria. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
