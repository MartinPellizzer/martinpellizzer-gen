    "intro": "Ficus sarmentosa var. sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with long, slender stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along surfaces. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but generally not for humans. This species is often used in horticulture for its ability to cover walls, trellises, and other structures."
