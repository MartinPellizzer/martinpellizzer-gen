    "intro": "Filipendula auriculata f. chionea, commonly known as the snowdrop filipendula, is a botanical variant of the common meadow sweet. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This form is noted for its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical species."
