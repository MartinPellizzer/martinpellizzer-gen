    "intro": "Fissistigma xylopetalum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when ripe. Fissistigma xylopetalum is notable for its unique adaptations to survive in extreme environmental conditions."
