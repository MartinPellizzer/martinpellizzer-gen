    "intro": "Ficus paludica, commonly known as the swamp fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is well adapted to periodic flooding. Its roots help stabilize soil and it plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
