    "intro": "Franciscea macrophylla, commonly known as the giant francesca, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of bark that provides protection against harsh coastal conditions. Franciscea macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
