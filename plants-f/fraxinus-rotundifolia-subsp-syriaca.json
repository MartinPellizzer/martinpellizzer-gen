    "intro": "Fraxinus rotundifolia subsp. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian ash, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its oval to round leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to a range of climate conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional landscaping."
