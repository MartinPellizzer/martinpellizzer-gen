    "intro": "Fimbristylis tonensis, commonly known as the Vietnamese sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a triangular cross-section, a characteristic feature of many sedges. Fimbristylis tonensis produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of its flowering stems."
