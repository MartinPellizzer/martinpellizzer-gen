    "intro": "Festuca hircina, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. Festuca hircina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
