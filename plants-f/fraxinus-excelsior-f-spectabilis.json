    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. spectabilis, commonly known as the showy ash, is a rare and distinctive form of the common ash. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, and often pendulous leaves that are a deep green with a silvery underside. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist woodland habitats across Europe. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage, which makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
