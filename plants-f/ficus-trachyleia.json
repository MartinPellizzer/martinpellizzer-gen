It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by green, round fruits that turn yellow when mature. It is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The tree is also valued for its rubbery latex, which has been used in traditional applications."
