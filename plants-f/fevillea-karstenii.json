    "intro": "Fevillea karstenii, commonly known as the Karsten's fevillea, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. Native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil, it is characterized by its unique, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of a maple tree. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing epiphytically on trees. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
