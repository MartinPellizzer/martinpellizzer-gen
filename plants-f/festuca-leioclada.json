    "intro": "Festuca leioclada, commonly known as the blue false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca leioclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky and disturbed sites."
