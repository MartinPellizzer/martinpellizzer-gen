    "intro": "Frangula scopulorum, commonly known as the rock-frangula, is a shrub native to the rocky habitats of western North America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Frangula scopulorum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on steep slopes and cliffs. Its structure and growth patterns make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
