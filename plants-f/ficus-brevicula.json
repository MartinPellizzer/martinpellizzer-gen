    "intro": "Ficus brevicula, commonly known as the dwarf rubber plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by white, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not for humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements. Its compact size makes it suitable for indoor spaces where space is limited."
