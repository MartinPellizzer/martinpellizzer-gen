    "intro": "Fraxinus angustifolia var. persica, commonly known as the Persian ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its long, narrow leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged fruits called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. The Persian ash is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
