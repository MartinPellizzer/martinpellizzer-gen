It typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged fruits called samaras.
