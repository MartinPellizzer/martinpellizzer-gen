    "intro": "Festuca subulata var. fraseriana, commonly known as Fraser's sedge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
