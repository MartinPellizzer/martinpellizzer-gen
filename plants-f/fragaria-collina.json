    "intro": "Fragaria collina, commonly known as the alpine strawberry, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the common strawberry. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Fragaria collina is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high altitudes."
