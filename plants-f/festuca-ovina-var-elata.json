    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. elata, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Festuca ovina var. elata is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
