    "intro": "Flaveria longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf flaveria, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Flaveria longifolia is also notable for its role in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
