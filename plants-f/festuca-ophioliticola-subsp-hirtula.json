    "intro": "Festuca ophioliticola subsp. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific alpine and subalpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its subspecies name. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often reddish or brownish in color. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
