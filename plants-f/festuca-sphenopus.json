    "intro": "Festuca sphenopus, commonly known as narrowleaf fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Festuca sphenopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
