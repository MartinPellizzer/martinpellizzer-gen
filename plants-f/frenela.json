    "intro": "Frenela, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Frenela species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They are also sometimes cultivated for their ability to thrive in poor soils."
