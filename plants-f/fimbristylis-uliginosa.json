    "intro": "Fimbristylis uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp flat sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Fimbristylis uliginosa is an important component of the flora in many coastal and inland wetlands."
