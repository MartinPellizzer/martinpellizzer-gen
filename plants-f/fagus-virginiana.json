It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, spiky husks that enclose its edible, sweet nuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The American beech plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
