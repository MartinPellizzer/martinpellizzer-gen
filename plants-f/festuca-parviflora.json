    "intro": "Festuca parviflora, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to white flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Festuca parviflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
