    "intro": "Farsetia lunarioides, commonly known as the moonflower fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble the shape of a crescent moon. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Farsetia lunarioides is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
