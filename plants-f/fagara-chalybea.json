    "intro": "Fagara chalybea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, bark-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. Fagara chalybea is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and tool-making. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
