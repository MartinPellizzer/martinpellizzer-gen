    "intro": "Festuca norica, commonly known as Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca norica is well adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
