    "intro": "Fraxinus oxyphylla var. rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ash, is a variant of the ash tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Fraxinus oxyphylla. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous clusters, which are followed by samaroid fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
