    "intro": "Freycinetia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed pandanus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and thatching. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-angled berries. It thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often growing in dense stands. Freycinetia oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines."
