    "intro": "Festuca kemerovensis, commonly known as Kemerovo fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Siberia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
