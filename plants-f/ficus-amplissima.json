    "intro": "Ficus amplissima, commonly known as the Giant Ficus or Ficus Rubra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus amplissima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
