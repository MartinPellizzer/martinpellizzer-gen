    "intro": "Fagara dissita var. hispida, commonly known as the rough-hairy fagara, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
