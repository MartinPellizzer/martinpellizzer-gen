    "intro": "Ficus acamptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pointed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by edible figs, which are a key feature of its botanical profile. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus acamptophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
