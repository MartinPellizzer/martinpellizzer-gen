It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. It has hairy leaves and produces small, disc-like flower heads that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Flaveria pringlei is also noted for its role in ecological studies due to its unique genetic traits and potential for hybridization with other species."
