    "intro": "Ficus carinata, commonly known as the warty fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, warty bark and glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Ficus carinata thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
