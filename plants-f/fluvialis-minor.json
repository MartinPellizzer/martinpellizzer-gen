    "intro": "Fluvialis minor, commonly known as the lesser fluvial grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found along streams and rivers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
