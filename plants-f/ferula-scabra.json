    "intro": "Ferula scabra, commonly known as the rough ferula, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its taproot is thick and fibrous, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils. Ferula scabra is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
