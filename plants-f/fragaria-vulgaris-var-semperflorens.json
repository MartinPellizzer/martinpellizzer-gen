    "intro": "Fragaria vulgaris var. semperflorens, commonly known as the everbearing strawberry, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, edible berries that are typically smaller and less flavorful than those of the common garden strawberry. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers that develop into fruit throughout the growing season. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of fruit in cooler climates. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to bear fruit multiple times during the growing season."
