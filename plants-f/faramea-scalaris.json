    "intro": "Faramea scalaris, commonly known as the scalloped faramea, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red or orange berries. Faramea scalaris is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively uncommon in gardens outside its native range."
