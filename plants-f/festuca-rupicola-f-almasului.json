    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. almasului, commonly known as Almasul's rockgrass, is a horticultural form of a perennial grass native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It features fine, silver-gray foliage with a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring cooler climates. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is increasingly popular among gardeners specializing in alpine and rock garden plants."
