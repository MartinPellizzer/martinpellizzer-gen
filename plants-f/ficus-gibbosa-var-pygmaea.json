    "intro": "Ficus gibbosa var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf fig tree, is a compact, slow-growing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically small and rounded, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is usually not large or showy. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
