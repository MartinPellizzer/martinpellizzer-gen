    "intro": "Ferula elegans, commonly known as the Persian cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of volatile oils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a fern-like appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Ferula elegans is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
