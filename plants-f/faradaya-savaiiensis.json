    "intro": "Faradaya savaiiensis, commonly known as the Sumba sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Indonesian island of Sumba. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Faradaya savaiiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
