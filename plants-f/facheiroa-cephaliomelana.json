    "intro": "Facheiroa cephaliomelana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it has adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and adapted for water conservation, while its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
