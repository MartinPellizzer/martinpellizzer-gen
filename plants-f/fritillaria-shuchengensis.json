    "intro": "Fritillaria shuchengensis, commonly known as the Shucheng fritillary, is a rare and endemic bulbous plant native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a single, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and blooms in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
