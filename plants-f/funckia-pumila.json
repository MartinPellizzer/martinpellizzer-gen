    "intro": "Funckia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf funckia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its slow growth and drought tolerance, it is a low-maintenance plant ideal for xeriscaping."
