    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. rubra, commonly known as red mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. Festuca ovina subsp. rubra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
