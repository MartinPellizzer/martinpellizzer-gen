    "intro": "Funkia subcordata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a popular choice for water gardens and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture. Funkia subcordata is also valued for its ability to help stabilize soil and improve water quality in wetland environments."
