    "intro": "Fragariastrum collettianum, commonly known as the Collett's strawberry, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to the cultivated strawberries of the genus Fragaria. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible berries that are smaller and less sweet than common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
