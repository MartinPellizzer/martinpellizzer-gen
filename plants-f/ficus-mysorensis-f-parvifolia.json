It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its inflorescences produce both male and female flowers, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine due to their purported therapeutic properties."
