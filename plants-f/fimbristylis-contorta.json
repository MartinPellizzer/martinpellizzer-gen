    "intro": "Fimbristylis contorta, commonly known as the twisted sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctively twisted appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Fimbristylis contorta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support wetland biodiversity."
