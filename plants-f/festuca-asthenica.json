    "intro": "Festuca asthenica, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca asthenica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
