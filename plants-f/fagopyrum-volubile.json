    "intro": "Fagopyrum volubile, commonly known as climbing buckwheat, is a perennial vine native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Fagopyrum volubile is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
