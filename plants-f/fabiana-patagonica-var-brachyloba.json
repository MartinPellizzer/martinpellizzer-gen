    "intro": "Fabiana patagonica var. brachyloba, commonly known as Patagonian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open landscapes. This variant is distinguished by its shorter floral lobes compared to the typical form of Fabiana patagonica."
