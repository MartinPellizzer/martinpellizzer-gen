    "intro": "Fevillea cordifolia var. hederacea, commonly known as the heart-leaf ivy, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used as a decorative foliage plant in hanging baskets or trained on trellises. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening."
