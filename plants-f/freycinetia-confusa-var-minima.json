    "intro": "Freycinetia confusa var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf freycinetia, is a rare and compact variant of the freycinetia genus native to New Caledonia. It is a flowering plant characterized by its small, narrow leaves and inconspicuous, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and restricted distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
