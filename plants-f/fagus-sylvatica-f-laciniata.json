    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. laciniata, commonly known as the dissected European beech, is a striking variant of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its finely serrated, deeply lobed leaves that create a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. This form is a natural variation that occurs in certain regions of Europe, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The leaves turn a vibrant yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and can thrive in well-drained, fertile soil."
