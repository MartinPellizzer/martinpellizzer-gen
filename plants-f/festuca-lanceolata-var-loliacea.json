    "intro": "Festuca lanceolata var. loliacea, commonly known as slender fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for insects and soil stabilization."
