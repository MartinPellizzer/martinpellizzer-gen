    "intro": "Flourensia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous flourensia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it exudes a resinous scent when damaged. Flourensia resinosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
