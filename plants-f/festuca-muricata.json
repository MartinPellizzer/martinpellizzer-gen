It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Festuca muricata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a common ornamental and ecological plant in gardens and natural habitats."
