    "intro": "Festuca marginata subsp. timbalii, commonly known as the Timbalii fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a distinctive silver-gray margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca marginata subsp. timbalii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
