    "intro": "Ficus crassipedicellata, commonly known as the rough-leaved fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are usually rough to the touch, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes pubescent underside. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature, though they may change color depending on the species. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Ficus crassipedicellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
