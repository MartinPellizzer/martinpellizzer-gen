    "intro": "Ficaria calthifolia, commonly known as the meadow foxfire, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Ficaria calthifolia is often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges."
