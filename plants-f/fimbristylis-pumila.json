It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems are usually short and bear small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Fimbristylis pumila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
