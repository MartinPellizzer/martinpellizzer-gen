The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are usually green or brown in color. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. Fimbristylis horsfieldii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
