    "intro": "Floresia, commonly known as the \"flower of the island,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines. Floresia species are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and their leaves are usually ovate or elliptical in shape. The flowers are often clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences, making them visually striking in their natural habitat."
