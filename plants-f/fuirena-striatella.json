    "intro": "Fuirena striatella, commonly known as the striped liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinct, striated appearance on its surface. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a spiral pattern and are covered with a waxy cuticle to prevent desiccation. Fuirena striatella plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
