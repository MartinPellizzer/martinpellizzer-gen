    "intro": "Ficus myxifolia, commonly known as the swamp fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, round figs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its ability to tolerate wet conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
