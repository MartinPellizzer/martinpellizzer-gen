    "intro": "Fremontia obispoensis, commonly known as the Obispo's fremontia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in canyons and slopes with limited moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fremontia obispoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
