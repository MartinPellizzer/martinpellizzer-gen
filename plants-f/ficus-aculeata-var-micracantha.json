    "intro": "Ficus aculeata var. micracantha, commonly known as the silver ficus or silver star ficus, is a tropical plant characterized by its striking silver-white variegation on its broad, heart-shaped leaves. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. The plant has a compact growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, green fig fruits that are typically not edible for humans. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
