    "intro": "Ferulago trifida var. kermanensis, commonly known as Kerman's ferulago, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Iran. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions with its succulent stems and reduced leaf structures. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
