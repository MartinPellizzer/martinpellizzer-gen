    "intro": "Fraxinus ornus var. salicifoliolata, commonly known as the weeping ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its drooping branches and soft, feathery foliage. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are elliptical with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface, often turning yellow in the autumn. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and urban landscapes. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
