    "intro": "Festuca barrazae, commonly known as the Barraza's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Festuca barrazae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or alpine habitats."
