It is a member of the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with long, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found growing near coastal areas or in moist lowland forests. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
