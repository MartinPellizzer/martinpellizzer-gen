    "intro": "Filix \u00d7 boottii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Adiantum capillus-veneris* and *Adiantum pedatum*. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, hairy structures called indusia. Filix \u00d7 boottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
