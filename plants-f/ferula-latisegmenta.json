    "intro": "Ferula latisegmenta, commonly known as the broad-segmented ferula, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive floral structures. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features a tall, slender stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its umbellate inflorescence consists of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is known for its strong, resinous scent, which is attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its tissues."
