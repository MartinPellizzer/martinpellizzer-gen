    "intro": "Ficus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible figs. Ficus stenophylla is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
