    "intro": "Fuirena mollicula, commonly known as the silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other flowering plants. The plant has a slender, yellowish stem covered in soft, hair-like structures that give it its common name. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters. Fuirena mollicula is found in various parts of Europe and is considered a rare and elusive species."
