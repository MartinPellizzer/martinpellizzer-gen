    "intro": "Festuca racemifera, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue-green leaves that are adapted to cold and high-altitude environments. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically blue to purple in color, adding to its ornamental value. Festuca racemifera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient plant suitable for ecological restoration projects in harsh climates."
