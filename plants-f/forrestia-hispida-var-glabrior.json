    "intro": "Forrestia hispida var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth forestiera, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, though the varietal name \"glabrior\" suggests a smoother texture compared to the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable plant for ornamental landscaping. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
