    "intro": "Festuca trabutii, commonly known as Trabut's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and poor soils, making it a resilient species. Festuca trabutii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
