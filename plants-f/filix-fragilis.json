    "intro": "Filix fragilis, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Filix fragilis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and adaptability."
