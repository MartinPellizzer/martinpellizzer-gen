    "intro": "Festuca leysseri, commonly known as alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically forms dense, low-growing tussocks with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Festuca leysseri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
