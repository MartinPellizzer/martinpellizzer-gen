    "intro": "Festuca calva, commonly known as the slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping. Festuca calva is also an important component of certain ecological systems, supporting a variety of insect and bird life."
