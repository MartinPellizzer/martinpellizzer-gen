    "intro": "Fritillaria karelinii, commonly known as the Caucasian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, often with contrasting purple or black markings. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasons. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
