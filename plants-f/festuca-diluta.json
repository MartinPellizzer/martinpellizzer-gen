    "intro": "Festuca diluta, commonly known as slender fescue, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Festuca diluta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to form attractive, low-maintenance ground cover."
