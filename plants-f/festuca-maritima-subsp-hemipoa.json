    "intro": "Festuca maritima subsp. hemipoa, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy, salt-affected soils and is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
