    "intro": "Felicia, commonly known as the \"sunflower of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of about 100 species, many of which are native to Africa, the Mediterranean region, and parts of Asia. These plants are characterized by their bright yellow or orange flowers, which are typically daisy-like in appearance. Felicia species are often shrubs or herbs, with small, narrow leaves and a tendency to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. They are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
