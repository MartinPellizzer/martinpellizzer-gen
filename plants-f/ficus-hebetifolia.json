    "intro": "Ficus hebetifolia, commonly known as the pale fig or hairy fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its pale green, hairy leaves that are often clustered at the tips of its branches. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible figs, though these are typically not consumed by humans. Ficus hebetifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
