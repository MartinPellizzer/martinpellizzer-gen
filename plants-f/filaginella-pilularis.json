    "intro": "Filaginella pilularis, commonly known as the ball moss, is a species of epiphytic liverwort found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It typically grows on trees, rocks, or other surfaces in humid environments. Filaginella pilularis plays a role in providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
