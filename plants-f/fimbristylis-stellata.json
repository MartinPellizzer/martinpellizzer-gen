It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikelets that give it a star-like appearance. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as swamps and seasonally flooded areas. Its leaves are linear and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Fimbristylis stellata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
