    "intro": "Ficus sechellarum, commonly known as the Seychelles fig, is a rare and endemic species native to the Seychelles archipelago. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and is protected in its native range."
