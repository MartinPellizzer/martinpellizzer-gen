    "intro": "Fraxinus albicans, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with 9 to 13 leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant. The wood of Fraxinus albicans is strong and flexible, historically valued for basket-making and tool handles."
