These plants are characterized by their fragrant, citrus-like fruits that are edible both when unripe and ripe. The leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, while the flowers are typically white or pale yellow. Fortunella species are often grown for their ornamental value and unique fruit, which can be eaten whole. They thrive in warm climates and require well-drained soil for optimal growth."
