    "intro": "Festuca brevipaleata, commonly known as the short-paleate fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
