    "intro": "Forasaccus diandrus, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and green veined leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent lip and spurred petals, which are adaptations for specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Forasaccus diandrus is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
