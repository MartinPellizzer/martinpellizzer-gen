    "intro": "Ficus convexa, commonly known as the glossy fig or the African rubber plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant has a woody stem that can grow quite tall, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Ficus convexa produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by fig-like fruits, though the fruits are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its lush foliage."
