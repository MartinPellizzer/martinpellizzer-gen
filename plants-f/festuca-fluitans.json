    "intro": "Festuca fluitans, commonly known as floating fescue, is a perennial grass species that thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on the surface of water bodies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Due to its adaptability, Festuca fluitans is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
