    "intro": "Festuca sulcata var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock festuca, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
