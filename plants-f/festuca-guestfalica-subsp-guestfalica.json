    "intro": "Festuca guestfalica subsp. guestfalica, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
