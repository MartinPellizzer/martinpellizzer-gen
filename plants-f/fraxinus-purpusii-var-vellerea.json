    "intro": "Fraxinus purpusii var. vellerea, commonly known as the Vellerea ash, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the ash tree. It is native to specific regions of China, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its finely textured, silvery-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, while its fruits are elongated samaras that disperse seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
