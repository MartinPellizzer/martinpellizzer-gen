    "intro": "Fumaria ballii var. tiznitensis, commonly known as the Tiznit fumitory, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces elongated, spiral-shaped seed pods that release seeds through a mechanism involving explosive dehiscence. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This variety is native to North Africa, particularly Morocco, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
