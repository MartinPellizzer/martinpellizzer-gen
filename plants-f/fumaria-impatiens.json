    "intro": "Fumaria impatiens, commonly known as the common fumitory, is a flowering plant in the family Fumariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Fumaria impatiens is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
