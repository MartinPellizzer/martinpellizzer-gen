    "intro": "Festuca tenuiflora var. biuncialis, commonly known as the slenderflower fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
