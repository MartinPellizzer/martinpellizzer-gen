It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in marginal environments."
