    "intro": "Frailea pseudogracillima, commonly known as the slender rock cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. It is a small, globular cactus with a short, cylindrical stem that often branches at the base. The plant features pale green to bluish-green spiny stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in late spring or early summer. Frailea pseudogracillima is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
