    "intro": "Festuca cepacea, commonly known as purple meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Festuca cepacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
