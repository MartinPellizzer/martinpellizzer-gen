    "intro": "Ficus aurantiacea, commonly known as the orange fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, orange-colored fruits that are similar in appearance to figs. It thrives in humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. Ficus aurantiacea is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
