    "intro": "Festuca aristata, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often adorned with a distinctive white or pale blue hue. Festuca aristata thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize slopes in alpine landscapes."
