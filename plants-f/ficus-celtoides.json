    "intro": "Ficus celtoides, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, trailing growth habit and small, waxy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ability to cover structures or ground surfaces. Ficus celtoides is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and adaptability to various soil types."
