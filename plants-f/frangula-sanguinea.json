    "intro": "Frangula sanguinea, commonly known as scarlet baneberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its striking red berries that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of its toxic, ornamental berries in late summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
