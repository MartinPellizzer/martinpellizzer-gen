    "intro": "Fegimanra, commonly known as the Moonshade Bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking, pale lavender petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant has a compact, bushy structure with dark green, waxy leaves that reflect moonlight. Its roots are rich in alkaloids and are used in traditional medicine for their calming properties. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, it is highly sought after by botanists and herbalists alike."
