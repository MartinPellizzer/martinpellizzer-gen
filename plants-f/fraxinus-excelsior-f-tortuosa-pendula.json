    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior f. tortuosa-pendula, commonly known as the twisted weeping ash, is a unique form of the common ash tree. It is characterized by its contorted, twisted branches that cascade in a weeping manner, creating an ornamental and visually striking appearance. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and ovate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse by wind. This form is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its distinctive form and aesthetic value in gardens."
