    "intro": "Fraxinus oxycarpa f. edentata, commonly known as the toothless white ash, is a variant of the white ash tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin that lacks the serrations found in the typical species. The plant is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience to urban environments."
