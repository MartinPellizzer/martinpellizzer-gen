    "intro": "Faustula, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and tall, unbranched stems bearing clusters of small, greenish or reddish flowers. Faustula species are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance. They are typically herbaceous perennials, though some species may have a woody base."
