    "intro": "Festuca diandra, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a dull green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca diandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
