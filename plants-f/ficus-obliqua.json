    "intro": "Ficus obliqua, commonly known as the wild fig or tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Ficus obliqua thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its versatile nature makes it both ecologically and economically significant in its native regions."
