    "intro": "Fragaria orientalis var. concolor, commonly known as the pale-flowered strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, edible berries that are typically less flavorful than those of common strawberries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and a fibrous root system adapted to rocky soils. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
