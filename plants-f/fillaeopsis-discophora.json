    "intro": "Fillaeopsis discophora, commonly known as the disc-shaped leaf fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, round sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is relatively rare and is found in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
