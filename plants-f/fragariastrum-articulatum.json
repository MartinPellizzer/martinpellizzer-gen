    "intro": "Fragariastrum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive jointed stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to strawberries but are typically smaller and have a more acidic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and culinary potential, it is of interest to both botanists and horticulturists."
