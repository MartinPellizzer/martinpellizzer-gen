    "intro": "Ficus diabolica, commonly known as the Devil's fig, is a species of fig tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, gnarled trunk that gives it an eerie appearance. The plant produces small, inedible fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in dense forests. Due to its unique appearance and association with superstition, it is sometimes considered an ominous plant in local folklore."
