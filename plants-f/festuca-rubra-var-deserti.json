    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. deserti, commonly known as desert bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish sheen, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to poor soil conditions and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
