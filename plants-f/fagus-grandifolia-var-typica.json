    "intro": "Fagus grandifolia var. typica, commonly known as the American beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, edible beechnuts encased in spiny husks, which are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The American beech is also valued for its durable wood and its role in ecological succession."
