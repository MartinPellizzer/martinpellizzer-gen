    "intro": "Festuca trachyphylla f. firmulacea, commonly known as the firm-leaf fescue, is a cool-season grass that exhibits dense, tufted growth. It is characterized by its narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant typically forms low-growing sods and is well-suited for erosion control in dry, rocky soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
