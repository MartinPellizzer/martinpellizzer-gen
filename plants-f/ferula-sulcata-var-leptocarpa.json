    "intro": "Ferula sulcata var. leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its taproot is thick and fibrous, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
