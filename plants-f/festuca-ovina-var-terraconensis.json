    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. terraconensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and stabilize soil, contributing to erosion control. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, adding ornamental value to its habitat."
