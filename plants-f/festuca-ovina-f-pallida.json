    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. pallida, commonly known as silverblue fescue, is a cool-season grass that exhibits a distinct silver-blue hue due to its fine, densely packed leaves. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to silver flowers, which are typically short-lived and appear in late spring to early summer. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover, helping to prevent erosion in harsh environments. Festuca ovina f. pallida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
