    "intro": "Festuca ovina f. subspicata, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Festuca ovina f. subspicata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
