    "intro": "Fraxinus elongatifolia, commonly known as the elongated ash, is a species of flowering plant in the olive family, Oleaceae. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive elongated shape. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively fast-growing, making it a valuable ornamental and ecological species."
