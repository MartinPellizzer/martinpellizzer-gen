    "intro": "Festuca denticulata, commonly known as the toothed fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with small teeth along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Festuca denticulata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
