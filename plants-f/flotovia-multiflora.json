    "intro": "Flotovia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered flotovia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in partial to full sunlight and prefers well-drained, moist soils. Flotovia multiflora is often found in woodland edges and moist meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
