    "intro": "Festuca inermis subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy false bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming a carpet-like appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety texture. It is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
