    "intro": "Ficus lumutana, commonly known as the Lumutana fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits. Ficus lumutana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
