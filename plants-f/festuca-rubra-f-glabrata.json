    "intro": "Festuca rubra f. glabrata, commonly known as red fescue, is a cool-season grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, carpet-like appearance. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. It is often used in lawn and turfgrass applications due to its drought tolerance and ability to withstand foot traffic. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, pale green to reddish flowers."
