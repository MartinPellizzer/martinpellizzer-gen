    "intro": "Feuilleea cauliflora, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its striking, velvety foliage. It is native to the humid tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom directly from the stems, a phenomenon known as cauliflory. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, silky texture that gives it its common name. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
