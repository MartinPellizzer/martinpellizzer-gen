It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive spotted pattern. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. Its bulbs are adapted for survival in arid conditions, storing water and nutrients. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soils."
