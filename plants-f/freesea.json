    "intro": "Freesea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that resemble small sea urchins. Native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean, it thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found along shorelines. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Freesea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
