It features bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has heart-shaped, smooth leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a notable wildflower."
