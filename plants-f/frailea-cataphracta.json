    "intro": "Frailea cataphracta, commonly known as the rock cactus or the dragon's tongue cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is a small, globular plant with a dense covering of spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are relatively short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
