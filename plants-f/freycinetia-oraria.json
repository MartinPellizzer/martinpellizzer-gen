    "intro": "Freycinetia oraria, commonly known as the coastal pandanus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often lined with small, sharp teeth. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Freycinetia oraria thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
