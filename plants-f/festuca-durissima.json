    "intro": "Festuca durissima, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Festuca durissima is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for landscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and ability to maintain color throughout the growing season."
