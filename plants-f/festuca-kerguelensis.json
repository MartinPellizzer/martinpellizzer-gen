    "intro": "Festuca kerguelensis, commonly known as Kerguelen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subantarctic region, particularly the Kerguelen Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue, with a short ligule at the base. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various arthropods in its native habitat."
