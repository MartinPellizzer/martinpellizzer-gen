    "intro": "Freycinetia inouei, commonly known as the Hainan freycinetia, is a rare cycad species native to the Hainan Island in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, ellipsoid seeds. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
