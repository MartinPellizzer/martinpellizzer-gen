    "intro": "Festuca fontqueriana, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca fontqueriana is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
