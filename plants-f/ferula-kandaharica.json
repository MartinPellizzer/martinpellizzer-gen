It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ferula kandaharica thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
