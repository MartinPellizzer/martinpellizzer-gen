It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in a terminal umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic resinous sap is a notable feature, often used in traditional medicine. Ferula sadleriana is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
