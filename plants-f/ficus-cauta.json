    "intro": "Ficus cauta, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals. Ficus cauta is often used in horticulture as a ground cover due to its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
