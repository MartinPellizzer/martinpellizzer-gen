It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and compact, blue-gray foliage that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
