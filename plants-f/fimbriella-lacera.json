    "intro": "Fimbriella lacera, commonly known as the fringed bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowering stems bear small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Fimbriella lacera is known for its unique trapping mechanism, which contributes to its role as a carnivorous plant in its ecosystem."
