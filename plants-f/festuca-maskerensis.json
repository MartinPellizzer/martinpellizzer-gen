    "intro": "Festuca maskerensis, commonly known as the Masker's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually compact and produce small, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca maskerensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
