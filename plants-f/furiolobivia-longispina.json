It is characterized by its elongated, spiny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
