    "intro": "Ficus alnifolia, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant in the Moraceae family, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often elongated and pointed. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not typically consumed by humans. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus alnifolia is also known for its air-purifying qualities and ability to improve indoor air quality."
