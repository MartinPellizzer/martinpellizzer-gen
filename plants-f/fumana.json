    "intro": "Fumana, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue or white petals that resemble mist or smoke, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a short flowering period, typically during the cooler months, and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical name, *Fumana*, reflects its mist-like appearance, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not widely available in commercial horticulture."
