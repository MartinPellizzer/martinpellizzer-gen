    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. cryophila, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold, mountainous regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, silver-green foliage. This subspecies thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine tundras and rocky slopes. Its compact growth and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological significance in cold environments."
