    "intro": "Festuca myuros f. major, commonly known as the tall meadow fescue, is a variant of the meadow fescue species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender grass blades that can grow up to 1 meter in height, making it a distinctive feature in grasslands and meadows. The plant has a clump-forming growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological and agricultural systems."
