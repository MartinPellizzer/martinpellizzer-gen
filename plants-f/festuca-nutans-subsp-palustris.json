    "intro": "Festuca nutans subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, arching stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
