    "intro": "Fragaria ovalis var. quinata, commonly known as the quinata strawberry, is a botanical variant of the strawberry plant characterized by its unique leaf morphology and fruit structure. It typically features trifoliate leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and its flowers are usually white with five petals. The fruits are small, aggregate berries that develop from multiple achenes, each containing a single seed. This variety is native to certain regions of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild flavor. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in botanical collections."
