    "intro": "Ficus toxicaria, commonly known as the crown of thorns, is a unique member of the Moraceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, palm-like structure. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a striking appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
