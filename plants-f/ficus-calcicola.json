    "intro": "Ficus calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fig, is a species native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found on rocky or limestone soils. Its fruit, which is a small, green fig, is an important food source for local wildlife. Ficus calcicola is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
