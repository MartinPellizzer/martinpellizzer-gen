    "intro": "Ficus discifera, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces small, greenish flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically clustered in spherical syconia. Ficus discifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
