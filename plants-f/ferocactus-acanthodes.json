    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes, commonly known as the spiny hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in thick, ribbed spines, providing both protection and water retention. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Ferocactus acanthodes is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
