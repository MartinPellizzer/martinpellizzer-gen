    "intro": "Ferula korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's giant fennel, is a tall, perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, followed by feathery seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and can grow quite large, often reaching lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Ferula korovinii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
