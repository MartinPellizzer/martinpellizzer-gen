    "intro": "Fraxinus xanthoxyloides, commonly known as the yellow ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and opposite, compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in floodplain forests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts."
