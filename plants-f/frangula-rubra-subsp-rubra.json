    "intro": "Frangula rubra subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark reddish bark and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, black berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riparian areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
