    "intro": "Fedia carnosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked due to its foliage. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Fedia carnosa is also considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
