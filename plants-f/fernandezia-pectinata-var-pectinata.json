    "intro": "Fernandezia pectinata var. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate fern, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound fronds with pectinately arranged pinnae, giving it a distinctive, feather-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to the humid, temperate climates of its native habitat."
