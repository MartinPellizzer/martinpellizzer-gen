    "intro": "Fraxinus parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has slender, often zigzagging branches. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
