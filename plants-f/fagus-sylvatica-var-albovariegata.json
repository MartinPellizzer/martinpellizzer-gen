    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica var. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-veined European beech, is a striking variant of the European beech tree. This plant is characterized by its distinctive white or silver veins on the leaves, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a broad, spreading crown. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks, which are a food source for various wildlife species."
