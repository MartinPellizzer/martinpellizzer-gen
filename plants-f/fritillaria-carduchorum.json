    "intro": "Fritillaria carduchorum, commonly known as the Persian fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
