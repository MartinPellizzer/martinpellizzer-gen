    "intro": "Fissistigma sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dense, greenish coloration and produces small, spherical capsules for reproduction. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on a single, undifferentiated body called a thallus. Fissistigma sphaerocarpum is often used as an indicator species for assessing the health of humid, undisturbed ecosystems."
