    "intro": "Festuca orthophylla var. eriostoma, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and compact growth habit, making it a desirable ornamental plant. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive silky texture due to the dense covering of short, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-growing turf-like stands."
