    "intro": "Fraxinus profunda, commonly known as the deep ash, is a rare and elusive species of ash tree native to the dense, moist forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its deep green, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems, forming a dense canopy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its roots are highly fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it a valuable species for wetland restoration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fraxinus profunda is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
