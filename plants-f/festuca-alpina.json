    "intro": "Festuca alpina, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. This plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with low temperatures and strong winds. Festuca alpina is often found in meadows, tundra, and slopes above the tree line. Its ability to withstand harsh conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
