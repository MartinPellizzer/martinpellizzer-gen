    "intro": "Ficus crassiramea subsp. stupenda, commonly known as the Stupendous Fig, is a rare and striking species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and green, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when mature, and it has a dense, bushy growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in specialized botanical collections."
