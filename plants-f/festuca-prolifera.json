    "intro": "Festuca prolifera, commonly known as the creeping fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Festuca prolifera thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
