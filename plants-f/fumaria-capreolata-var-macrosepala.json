    "intro": "Fumaria capreolata var. macrosepala, commonly known as the large-sepaled bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fumariaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive bladder-like structures called pseudobulbs, which are used for storage and reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting insect pollinators."
