    "intro": "Festuca nubigena, commonly known as cloud grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Festuca nubigena is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
