    "intro": "Ficus semilanata, commonly known as the variegated fig tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves with a combination of green, white, and yellow patterns. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its leaves are glossy and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its tropical environment. Ficus semilanata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
