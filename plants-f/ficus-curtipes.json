    "intro": "Ficus curtipes, commonly known as the dwarf fig or miniature fig, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features smooth, dark green leaves that are typically small and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green figs that are not typically consumed by humans but are important for local wildlife. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its slow growth and tolerance of low light conditions. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for bonsai and decorative purposes."
