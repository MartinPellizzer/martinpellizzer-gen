    "intro": "Fagus macrophylla, commonly known as the Tasmanian ash, is a deciduous tree native to Tasmania, Australia. It belongs to the beech family (Fagaceae) and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces small, cup-shaped fruits called nuts, which are enclosed in a woody husk. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. The bark is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more rugged as the tree matures."
