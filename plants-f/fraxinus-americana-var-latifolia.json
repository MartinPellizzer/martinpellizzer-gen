    "intro": "Fraxinus americana var. latifolia, commonly known as the American winged maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This variety is closely related to the common white ash but is distinguished by its broader leaves and unique winged seeds."
