    "intro": "Filipendula multijuga var. multijuga, commonly known as meadow sweet, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are important for pollinators, including bees and butterflies, and the plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
