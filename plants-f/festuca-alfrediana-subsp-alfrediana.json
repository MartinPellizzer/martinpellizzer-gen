    "intro": "Festuca alfrediana subsp. alfrediana, commonly known as Alfred's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control in marginal lands."
