    "intro": "Festuca kingii var. rabinosa, commonly known as the Rabinosa fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
