    "intro": "Fragariastrum nerimaniae, commonly known as the rare alpine strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but are much smaller and less commonly found. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to cold, high-altitude environments."
