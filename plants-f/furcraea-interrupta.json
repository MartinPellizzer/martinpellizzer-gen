    "intro": "Furcraea interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted furcraea, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its robust, upright stems and long, narrow leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters, which appear at the ends of the stems. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in full sun with minimal water."
