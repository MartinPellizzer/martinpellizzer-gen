    "intro": "Ficus sumatrana var. microsyce, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for certain animals but not generally consumed by humans. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
