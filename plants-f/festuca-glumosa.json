    "intro": "Festuca glumosa, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Festuca glumosa is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects."
