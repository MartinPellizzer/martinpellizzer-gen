    "intro": "Festuca lechleriana, commonly known as Lechler's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually bluish-green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca lechleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or alpine settings."
