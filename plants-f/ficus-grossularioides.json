    "intro": "Ficus grossularioides, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying qualities. Ficus grossularioides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to maintain its lush foliage."
