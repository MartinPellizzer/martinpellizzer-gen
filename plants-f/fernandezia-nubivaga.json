    "intro": "Fernandezia nubivaga, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests where humidity is consistently high. The plant has narrow, feathery fronds that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing cones, are concealed within the foliage, a characteristic common in many ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Fernandezia nubivaga is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a vulnerable species."
