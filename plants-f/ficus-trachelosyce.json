    "intro": "Ficus trachelosyce, commonly known as the white-veined fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, inedible fig-like fruits that are rarely seen due to the plant's enclosed inflorescence. Ficus trachelosyce is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
