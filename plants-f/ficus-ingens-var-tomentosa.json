    "intro": "Ficus ingens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly fig, is a large, evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its size and unique foliage, it is a popular choice for ornamental planting in tropical and subtropical gardens."
