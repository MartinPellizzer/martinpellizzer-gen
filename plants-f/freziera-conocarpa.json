    "intro": "Freziera conocarpa, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Freziera conocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
