    "intro": "Fumaria bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Fumariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, ascending stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces elongated, slender pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Fumaria bracteosa thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for garden use."
