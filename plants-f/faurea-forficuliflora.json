    "intro": "Faurea forficuliflora, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access groundwater. Its flowers are typically 2\u20134 inches in diameter and have five petals with a distinctive, narrow, blade-like shape. Faurea forficuliflora is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
