    "intro": "Fragaria vesca proles eflagellis, commonly known as the flagellated strawberry, is a rare and intriguing variant of the common strawberry. This plant exhibits unique botanical features, including elongated, whip-like structures on its fruiting bodies, which set it apart from typical strawberries. The foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Fragaria genus. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. Despite its unusual appearance, it retains the genetic traits of its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical research."
