    "intro": "Fraxinus pallida, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and compound leaves with five to nine leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in drooping clusters, followed by samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The white ash is valued for its strong, flexible wood, which has been used historically for various purposes."
