It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive wavy pattern on the petals. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
