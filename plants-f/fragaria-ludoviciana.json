    "intro": "Fragaria ludoviciana, commonly known as the Louisiana strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Its berries are edible and have a tart flavor, though they are not as commercially cultivated as other strawberry species. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
