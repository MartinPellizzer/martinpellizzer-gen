    "intro": "Ficus nishimurae, commonly known as the Nishimura fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Japan, specifically on the island of Shikoku. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly wavy margin. It produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Ficus nishimurae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
