    "intro": "Festuca poluninii, commonly known as the Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Festuca poluninii thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its ability to withstand extreme temperatures makes it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
