    "intro": "Fuscospora, commonly known as the black puffball, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Tulasnellaceae. It is characterized by its dark, spherical fruiting bodies that appear in clusters on decaying wood. The spores are released in a powdery form, which gives the fungus its common name. Fuscospora is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and damp woodlands. It plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
