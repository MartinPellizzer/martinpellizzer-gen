    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. indigesta, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and tufted growth habit, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and dry meadows. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Festuca duriuscula var. indigesta is generally considered a low-nutritious forage plant, making it less desirable for livestock grazing."
