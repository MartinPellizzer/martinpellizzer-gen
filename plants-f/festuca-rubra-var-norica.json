    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. norica, commonly known as Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has fine, dark green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its ability to form dense, durable turf. Festuca rubra var. norica is also important in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
