    "intro": "Fimbristylis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf threadgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Fimbristylis stenophylla is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
