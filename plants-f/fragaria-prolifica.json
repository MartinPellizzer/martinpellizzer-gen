    "intro": "Fragaria prolifica, commonly known as the prolific strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, edible fruits. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and flowers with five white petals, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its vigorous growth, it can spread rapidly and is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats."
