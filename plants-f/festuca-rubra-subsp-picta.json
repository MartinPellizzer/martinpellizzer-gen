    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. picta, commonly known as the painted bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and distinctive red or purple coloration on the leaf tips, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant typically forms dense, carpet-like mats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Festuca rubra subsp. picta is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in moist habitats."
