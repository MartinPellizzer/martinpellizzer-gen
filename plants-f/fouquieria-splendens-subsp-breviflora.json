    "intro": "Fouquieria splendens subsp. breviflora, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub-like plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, woody stem that branches into many small, narrow leaves. It is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system to access water. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert regions."
