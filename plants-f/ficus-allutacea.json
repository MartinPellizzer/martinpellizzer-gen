    "intro": "Ficus allutacea, commonly known as the silver ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by yellowish fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ornamental value. Its roots can also be used in traditional medicine in certain regions."
