    "intro": "Feuilleea catharinae, commonly known as the Catherine's leaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves that are often adorned with intricate silver veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the late spring and early summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
