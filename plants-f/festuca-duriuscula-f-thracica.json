    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula f. thracica, commonly known as the Thrace mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded grassland areas."
