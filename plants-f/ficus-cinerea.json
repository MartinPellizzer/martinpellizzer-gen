    "intro": "Ficus cinerea, commonly known as the gray ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fig fruits, which are typically not consumed by humans. Ficus cinerea thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its ability to tolerate low light makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
