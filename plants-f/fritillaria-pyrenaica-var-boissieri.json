    "intro": "Fritillaria pyrenaica var. boissieri, commonly known as the Pyrenean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically orange or reddish in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
