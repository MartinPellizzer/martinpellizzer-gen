It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spike-like inflorescences, which bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
