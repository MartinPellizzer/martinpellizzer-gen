    "intro": "Fraxinus floribunda, commonly known as the flowering ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters during early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. The tree produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
