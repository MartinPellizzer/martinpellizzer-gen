    "intro": "Fritillaria euboeica, commonly known as the Euboean fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Greek island of Euboea. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is typically found in open woodlands and meadows, where it blooms in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
