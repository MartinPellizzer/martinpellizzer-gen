    "intro": "Fagus antarctica var. sublobata, commonly known as the Antarctic beech, is a rare and cold-adapted species native to the Southern Hemisphere. It is a member of the Fagaceae family, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and production of edible nuts. The leaves are typically broad and lobed, with a distinctive sublobate shape that sets it apart from other beech varieties. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
