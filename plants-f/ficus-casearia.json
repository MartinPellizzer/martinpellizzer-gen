    "intro": "Ficus casearia, commonly known as the Hawaiian fig, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and the Marquesas Islands. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig fruits that are small and sweet. Ficus casearia thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
