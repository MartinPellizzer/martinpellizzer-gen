    "intro": "Fritillaria taipaiensis var. zhouquensis, commonly known as the Zhouqu fritillary, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
