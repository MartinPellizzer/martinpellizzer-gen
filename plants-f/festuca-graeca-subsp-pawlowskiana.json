    "intro": "Festuca graeca subsp. pawlowskiana, commonly known as the Greek bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green foliage that remains dense and compact throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and ability to form dense mats, contributing to erosion control in rocky or arid environments."
