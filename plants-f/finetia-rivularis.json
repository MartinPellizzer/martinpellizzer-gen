    "intro": "Finetia rivularis, commonly known as the river finetia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions. It typically grows near water sources, such as streams and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, trailing stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the rainy season. Finetia rivularis plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
