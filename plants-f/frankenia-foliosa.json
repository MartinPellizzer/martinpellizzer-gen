    "intro": "Frankenia foliosa, commonly known as coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle splash of color to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Frankenia foliosa is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
