    "intro": "Fleischmannia matudae, commonly known as the Matudae nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades such as tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, often blooming at night. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a rough texture, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched as it matures. Fleischmannia matudae is adapted to survive in dry environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand high temperatures."
