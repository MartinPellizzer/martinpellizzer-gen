    "intro": "Ficus carica var. violacea, commonly known as the violet fig, is a cultivar of the common fig tree characterized by its unique violet-colored leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value, with foliage that ranges from deep purple to bluish-green hues. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, providing a striking visual contrast to the tree's fruit. While it produces small, edible figs, the primary appeal of this plant lies in its foliage rather than its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
