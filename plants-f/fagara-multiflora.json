    "intro": "Fagara multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered fagara, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are typically clustered at the ends of the branches. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Fagara multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
