    "intro": "Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa nothosubsp. cuneifolia, commonly known as the cuneifolia strawberry, is a hybrid subspecies of the cultivated strawberry. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and slightly smaller, more acidic berries compared to typical strawberries. This subspecies is often found in cooler climates and thrives in well-drained soil. It is valued for its unique flavor profile and is used in both ornamental and culinary contexts. Due to its genetic complexity, it is a subject of interest in plant breeding and botanical research."
