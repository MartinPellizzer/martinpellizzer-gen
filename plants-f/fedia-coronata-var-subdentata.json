    "intro": "Fedia coronata var. subdentata, commonly known as the subdenticulate fedia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often in shaded forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive subdenticulate margin, giving it its botanical variant name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
