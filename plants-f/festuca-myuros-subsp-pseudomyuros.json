    "intro": "Festuca myuros subsp. pseudomyuros, commonly known as silvergrass or creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
