    "intro": "Ficus glomerata var. elongata, commonly known as the weeping fig or Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a cascading appearance, and its dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in indoor conditions with moderate light and regular watering. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice for both ornamental and indoor gardening."
