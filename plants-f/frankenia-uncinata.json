    "intro": "Frankenia uncinata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils along the shoreline. The plant features narrow, silvery-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology helps it survive in harsh, salty environments. Frankenia uncinata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
