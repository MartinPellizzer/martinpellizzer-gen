    "intro": "Fragariastrum valderium, commonly known as the Valderian strawberry, is a rare and delicate species of wild strawberry. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and edible, sweet-tart berries. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant has a low-growing habit with trifoliate leaves and produces fruit in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
