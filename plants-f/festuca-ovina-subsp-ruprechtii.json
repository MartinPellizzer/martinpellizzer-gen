    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. ruprechtii, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple florets, typical of the Festuca genus. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
