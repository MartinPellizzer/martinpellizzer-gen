    "intro": "Flotovia, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their ability to float on the surface of water, supported by specialized air-filled sacs called bladders. The bladders are used to trap small aquatic organisms, which the plant then digests for nutrients. Flotovia species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their unique adaptations allow them to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic habitats."
