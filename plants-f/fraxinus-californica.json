    "intro": "Fraxinus californica, commonly known as the California ash, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 feet and has a broad, spreading crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
