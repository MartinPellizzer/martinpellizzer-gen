    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana var. cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Florida Keys. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. This variety is relatively rare and has specific ecological roles in its native habitats."
