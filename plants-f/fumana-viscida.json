    "intro": "Fumana viscida, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that exude a sticky substance, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are often alternate and have a rough, textured surface. Fumana viscida is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
