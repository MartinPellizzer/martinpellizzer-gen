    "intro": "Festuca pallens var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shady fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
