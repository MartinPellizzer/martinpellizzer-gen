    "intro": "Ferocactus stainesii var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in prominent, radial spines. The plant produces showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This variety is also noted for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils."
