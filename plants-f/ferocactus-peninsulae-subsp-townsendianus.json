    "intro": "Ferocactus peninsulae subsp. townsendianus, commonly known as Townsend's barrel cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines and a dense coating of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to desert environments. The subspecies is notable for its relatively small size compared to other ferocactus species, with mature plants reaching heights of up to 2 meters."
