It is a perennial herb that produces small, edible fruits with a sweet and aromatic flavor. The plant has trifoliate leaves and pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with other strawberry species."
