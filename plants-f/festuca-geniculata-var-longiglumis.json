It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets with elongated glumes, which give it its distinguishing name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
