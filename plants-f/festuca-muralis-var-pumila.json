    "intro": "Festuca muralis var. pumila, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growths that often carpet rocky or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for alpine and rocky environments. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, contributing to its compact appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca muralis var. pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging habitats."
