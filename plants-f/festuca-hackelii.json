    "intro": "Festuca hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Festuca hackelii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
