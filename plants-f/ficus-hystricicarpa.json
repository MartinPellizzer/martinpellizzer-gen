    "intro": "Ficus hystricicarpa, commonly known as the spiny fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring thick, waxy leaves that are often spiny along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. Its roots are fibrous and capable of forming symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
