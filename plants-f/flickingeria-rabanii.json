    "intro": "Flickingeria rabanii, commonly known as the banana orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, banana-like pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Flickingeria rabanii is considered a conservation concern."
