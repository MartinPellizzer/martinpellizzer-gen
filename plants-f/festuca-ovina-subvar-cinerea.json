    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. cinerea, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, blue-green flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
