    "intro": "Frankenia scabra, commonly known as coastal bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Frankenia scabra is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system."
