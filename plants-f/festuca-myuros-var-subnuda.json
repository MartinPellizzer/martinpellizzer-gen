    "intro": "Festuca myuros var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked false brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, hairless stems that often lie prostrate or form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically lack the tufts of hair found in other Festuca species. This variety is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in challenging conditions."
