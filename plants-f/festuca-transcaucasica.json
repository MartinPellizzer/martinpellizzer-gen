    "intro": "Festuca transcaucasica, commonly known as Transcaucasian fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and semi-arid environments. Festuca transcaucasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky and degraded habitats."
