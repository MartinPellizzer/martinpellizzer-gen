    "intro": "Freycinetia biroi, commonly known as the Tahiti cycad, is a unique plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a significant component of the island's endemic flora. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
