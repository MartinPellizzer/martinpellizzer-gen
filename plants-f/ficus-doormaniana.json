    "intro": "Ficus doormaniana, commonly known as the Doormaniana fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are usually heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus doormaniana is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
