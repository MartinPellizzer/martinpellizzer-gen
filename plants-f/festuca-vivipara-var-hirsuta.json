    "intro": "Festuca vivipara var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy festuca, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca vivipara var. hirsuta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
