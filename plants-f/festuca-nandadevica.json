    "intro": "Festuca nandadevica, commonly known as Nanda Devi grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet with short, awned lemmas, which are distinctive features of the Festuca genus. Nanda Devi grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
