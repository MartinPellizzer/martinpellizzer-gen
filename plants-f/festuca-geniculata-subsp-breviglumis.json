It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are shorter and more compact compared to other subspecies of Festuca geniculata. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
