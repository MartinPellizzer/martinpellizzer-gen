    "intro": "Fedia tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with three prominent teeth along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
