    "intro": "Ficus ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri fig, is a species of fig tree native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its roots are robust and can help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Ficus ituriensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
