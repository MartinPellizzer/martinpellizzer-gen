It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
