    "intro": "Fallopia multiflora var. hypoleuca, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread rapidly and become invasive in non-native regions. The plant has heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves and produces small, creamy-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in urban areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
