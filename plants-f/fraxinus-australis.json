    "intro": "Fraxinus australis, commonly known as the Australian ash, is a deciduous tree native to southern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201315 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a rounded crown. The tree has opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The bark is smooth and light grey when young, becoming fissured and darker with age."
