    "intro": "Festuca macrophylla, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive purple-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Festuca macrophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
