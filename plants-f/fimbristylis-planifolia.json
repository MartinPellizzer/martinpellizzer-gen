    "intro": "Fimbristylis planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family. Fimbristylis planifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
