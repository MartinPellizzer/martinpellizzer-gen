    "intro": "Ficinia laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and delicate, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Ficinia laciniata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its intricate, lacy appearance, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
