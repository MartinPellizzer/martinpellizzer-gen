    "intro": "Falcatifolium falciforme var. kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) fronds that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
