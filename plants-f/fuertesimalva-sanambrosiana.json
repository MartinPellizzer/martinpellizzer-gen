    "intro": "Fuertesimalva sanambrosiana, commonly known as the San Ambrosiana fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a compact, creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in limestone-rich soils. Its spores are dispersed through wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
