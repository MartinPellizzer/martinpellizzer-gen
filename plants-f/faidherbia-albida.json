    "intro": "Faidherbia albida, commonly known as the African acacia or umbrella thorn, is a deciduous tree native to dry regions of Africa. It is characterized by its umbrella-shaped crown and long, thin, thorned branches. The tree has bipinnate leaves that are shed during the dry season, allowing it to conserve water. Its pale yellow flowers are followed by flat, winged pods that contain seeds. Faidherbia albida plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation and soil improvement in arid environments."
