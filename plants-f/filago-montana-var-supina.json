It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, creeping stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Filago montana var. supina is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations."
