    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior aucubifolia, commonly known as the European ash with aucubifolia foliage, is a hybrid or variant of the European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, aucubifolia-type leaves that resemble those of the aucuba plant, with a waxy, glossy surface and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in woodland areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This variant is less common in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage."
