    "intro": "Ficus martinicensis, commonly known as the banyan tree, is a species of fig tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and can grow into a sprawling tree with a massive canopy. The plant has a unique ability to produce aerial roots that hang from its branches and can take root in the soil, forming additional trunks. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Ficus martinicensis is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in warm environments."
