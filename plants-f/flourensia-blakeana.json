    "intro": "Flourensia blakeana, commonly known as Blake's flourensia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert plains. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
