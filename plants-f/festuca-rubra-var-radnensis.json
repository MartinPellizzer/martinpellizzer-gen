    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. radnensis, commonly known as red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Festuca rubra var. radnensis is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
