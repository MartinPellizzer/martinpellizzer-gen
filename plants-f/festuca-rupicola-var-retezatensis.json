    "intro": "Festuca rupicola var. retezatensis, commonly known as the Retezat fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, greenish-brown florets. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing soil in harsh, high-altitude habitats."
