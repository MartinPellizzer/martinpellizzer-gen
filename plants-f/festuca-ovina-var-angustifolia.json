It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense turf. The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
