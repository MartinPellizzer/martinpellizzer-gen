    "intro": "Franciscea acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf franciscea, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
