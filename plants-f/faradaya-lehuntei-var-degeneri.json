    "intro": "Faradaya lehuntei var. degeneri, commonly known as the Degener's faradaya, is a rare and endangered plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae, characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions for survival. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural range, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to prevent its extinction."
