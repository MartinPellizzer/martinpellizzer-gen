    "intro": "Ficus recurva var. pedicellata, commonly known as the weeping fig or pendula ficus, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping, cascading branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant has smooth, dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in indoor environments with moderate light and consistent care."
