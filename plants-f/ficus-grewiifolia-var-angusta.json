    "intro": "Ficus grewiifolia var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Ficus grewiifolia. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs, which are typically consumed fresh or dried. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its compact size and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
