    "intro": "Ficus sphenophylla, commonly known as the mountain fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, waxy leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife and humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
