    "intro": "Fuirena nana, commonly known as the dwarf fuirena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by gardeners interested in native flora."
