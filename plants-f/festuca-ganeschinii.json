    "intro": "Festuca ganeschinii, commonly known as Ganeschini fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
