    "intro": "Fagelia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky fagelia, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rough, often sticky bark and opposite, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Fagelia viscosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems where it is native."
