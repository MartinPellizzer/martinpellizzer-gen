    "intro": "Fimbrorchis sagittifera, commonly known as the arrowleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
