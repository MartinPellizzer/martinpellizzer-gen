    "intro": "Festuca heterophylla var. homophylla, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Blue grama is often used in native plant landscapes and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
