    "intro": "Faidherbia albida var. glabra, commonly known as the African brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and bipinnate leaves that turn red and drop in response to seasonal drought. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for agroforestry and land rehabilitation efforts."
