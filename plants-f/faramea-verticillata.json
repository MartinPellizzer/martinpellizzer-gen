It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
