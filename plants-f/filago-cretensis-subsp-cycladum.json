    "intro": "Filago cretensis subsp. cycladum, commonly known as the Cycladic filago, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Cyclades islands in Greece. It is a small, herbaceous annual with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
