    "intro": "Festuca duriuscula var. marginata, commonly known as the margins grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a distinctive silver or white margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute blue to purple flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
