    "intro": "Festuca castilloniana, commonly known as Castillon's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or semi-arid regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
