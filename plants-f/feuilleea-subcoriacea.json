    "intro": "Feuilleea subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved feuillea, is a unique plant species characterized by its thick, leathery foliage. Its leaves are typically elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, granular texture that gives them a slightly rough feel. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Feuilleea subcoriacea is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it demonstrates remarkable drought tolerance."
