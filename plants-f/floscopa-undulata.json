    "intro": "Floscopa undulata, commonly known as the wavy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, undulating petals that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Floscopa undulata is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
