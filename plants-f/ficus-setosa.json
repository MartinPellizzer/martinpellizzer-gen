    "intro": "Ficus setosa, commonly known as the small-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits known as figs. Ficus setosa thrives in humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties. Its ability to adapt to various light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
