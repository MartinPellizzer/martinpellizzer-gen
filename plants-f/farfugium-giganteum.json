    "intro": "Farfugium giganteum, commonly known as giant marsh tarweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features large, broadly rounded leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter, often with a waxy texture and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the summer, which are arranged in a circular pattern at the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for wet garden landscapes."
