    "intro": "Fouha, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and highly valued tree species native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the genus *Pterocarpus* in the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, fouha is now critically endangered and protected under international conservation laws."
