It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence known as a corymb. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
