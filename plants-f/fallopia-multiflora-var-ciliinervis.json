    "intro": "Fallopia multiflora var. ciliinervis, commonly known as the smoothleaf Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features robust, hollow stems that are often reddish-brown in color and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender peduncles. Its leaves are alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy underside, and have a distinctive ciliate (frayed) edge. This variant is often confused with other species of Fallopia due to its similar morphology and rapid growth habit."
