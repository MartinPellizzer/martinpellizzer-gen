    "intro": "Fragaria abnormis, commonly known as the abnormal strawberry, is a rare and unusual species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, including elongated, leaf-like structures and a reduced number of petals compared to typical strawberries. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often less flavorful and more acidic than those of common strawberries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in temperate regions. Due to its rarity and distinctive features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
