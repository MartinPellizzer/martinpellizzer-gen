    "intro": "Festuca psammophila subsp. muellerstollii, commonly known as the sand fescue, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal areas, and disturbed sites. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
