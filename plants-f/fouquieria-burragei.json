    "intro": "Fouquieria burragei, commonly known as the Burrage's ocotillo, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its long, spiny stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water, relying on deep root systems to access groundwater. Its flowers bloom in response to rainfall, often appearing after seasonal storms, making it a striking feature of desert landscapes. Fouquieria burragei plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and birds."
