    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. gaucheri, commonly known as the Alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
