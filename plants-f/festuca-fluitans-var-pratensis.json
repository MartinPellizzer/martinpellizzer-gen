    "intro": "Festuca fluitans var. pratensis, commonly known as watergrass or rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to aquatic environments and is often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and lakes. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
