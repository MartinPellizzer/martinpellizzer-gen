    "intro": "Friesodielsia oligophlebia, commonly known as the narrow-veined fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with closely spaced, slender veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
