    "intro": "Festuca crinum-ursi, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, tufted stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Festuca crinum-ursi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
