    "intro": "Festuca rubra subsp. oraria, commonly known as coastal bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime climates with salt spray and strong winds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and form dense mats near the ground. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
