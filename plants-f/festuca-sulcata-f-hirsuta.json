    "intro": "Festuca sulcata f. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy festuca, is a variant of the tall fescue species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades. It is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in open woodlands and grassy slopes. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for ornamental and landscaping purposes. Its foliage is typically dark green with a bluish tinge, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a dense, low-maintenance ground cover."
