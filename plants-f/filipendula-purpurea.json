    "intro": "Filipendula purpurea, commonly known as meadow sweet, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fragrant, yellowish-green flower clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Filipendula purpurea is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a source of natural dye."
