    "intro": "Ferocactus acanthodes subsp. tortulispinus, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in dense, sharp spines. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its fruits are fleshy, edible berries that are often consumed by both humans and animals. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, storing water in its thick stems and photosynthesizing efficiently in low-water environments."
