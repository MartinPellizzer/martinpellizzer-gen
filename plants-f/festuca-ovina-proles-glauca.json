    "intro": "Festuca ovina proles glauca, commonly known as blue sheep fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like clumps and is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue or greenish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their subtle coloration. This species is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
