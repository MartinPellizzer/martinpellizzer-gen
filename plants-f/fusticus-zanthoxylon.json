    "intro": "Fusticus zanthoxylon, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to parts of Africa. It is a medium to large-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The bark is thick, fissured, and often has a yellowish or brownish hue, which contributes to its common name. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The tree produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it is valued for its durable timber and ornamental qualities."
