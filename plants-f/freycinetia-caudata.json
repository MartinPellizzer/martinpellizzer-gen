    "intro": "Freycinetia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed cycad, is a unique plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Freycinetia caudata is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy species in tropical climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
