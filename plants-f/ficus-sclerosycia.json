    "intro": "Ficus sclerosycia, commonly known as the rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania, and thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its fruit, which is small and green, is edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Ficus sclerosycia is well adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
