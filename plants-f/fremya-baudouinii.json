    "intro": "Fremya baudouinii, commonly known as the Baudouin's lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Fremya baudouinii is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping in dry climates."
