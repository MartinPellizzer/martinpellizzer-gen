    "intro": "Festuca uniglumis subsp. agrestis, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are usually pubescent, giving it a rough texture, and it is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Festuca uniglumis subsp. agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
