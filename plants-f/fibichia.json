    "intro": "Fibichia, commonly known as the \"buttercup tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Fibichia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
