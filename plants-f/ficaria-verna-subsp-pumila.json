    "intro": "Ficaria verna subsp. pumila, commonly known as the winter beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
