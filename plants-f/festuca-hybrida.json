    "intro": "Festuca hybrida, commonly known as tall fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed flowers. Tall fescue is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a popular choice for lawns and pastures. Its deep root system helps it withstand drought and tolerate grazing, contributing to its widespread use in agricultural and horticultural settings."
