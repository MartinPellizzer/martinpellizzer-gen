    "intro": "Ferula alaica, commonly known as the Afghan cow's milk plant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers and has a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. Its roots are particularly valued for their medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits. Ferula alaica thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat."
