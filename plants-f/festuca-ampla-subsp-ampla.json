It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with small, awnless flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, rocky habitats. Festuca ampla subsp. ampla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
