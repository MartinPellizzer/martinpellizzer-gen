    "intro": "Fallugia acuminata var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandthorn, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
