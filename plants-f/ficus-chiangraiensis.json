    "intro": "Ficus chiangraiensis, commonly known as the Chiang Mai fig or Thai fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces edible figs that are typically green when mature, though they may turn red or yellow depending on the variety. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. Ficus chiangraiensis is also valued for its air-purifying properties and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
