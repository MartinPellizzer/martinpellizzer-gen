    "intro": "Ficus soroceoides var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone fig, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those rich in calcium, which gives it its specific epithet \"calcicola.\" This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
