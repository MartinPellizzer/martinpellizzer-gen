It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by greenish-white fig fruits, which are typically eaten by birds and other animals. It is well adapted to humid, warm climates and can thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Ficus imbricata is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air and is a popular houseplant."
