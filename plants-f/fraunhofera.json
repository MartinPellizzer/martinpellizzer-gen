    "intro": "Fraunhofera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, which gives the plant its common name. Fraunhofera species are typically shrubs or small trees that can grow up to several meters in height. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and other humid environments."
