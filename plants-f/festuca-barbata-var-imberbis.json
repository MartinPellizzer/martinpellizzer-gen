    "intro": "Festuca barbata var. imberbis, commonly known as the hairless false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often hairless, giving it its varietal name \"imberbis,\" meaning \"without hairs.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
