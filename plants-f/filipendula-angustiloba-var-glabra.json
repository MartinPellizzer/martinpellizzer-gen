    "intro": "Filipendula angustiloba var. glabra, commonly known as narrow-leaved meadow sweet, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered with soft, grayish hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly toothed margin. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems, which set it apart from other varieties of Filipendula."
