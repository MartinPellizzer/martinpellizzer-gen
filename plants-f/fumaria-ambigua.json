    "intro": "Fumaria ambigua, commonly known as the common fumitory, is a flowering plant in the family Fumariaceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are alternate, often with a hairy texture. Fumaria ambigua is a herbaceous annual that can grow up to 60 cm tall, and it is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and antiseptic properties."
