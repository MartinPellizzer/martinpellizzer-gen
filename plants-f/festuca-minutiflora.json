    "intro": "Festuca minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Festuca minutiflora plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil structure."
