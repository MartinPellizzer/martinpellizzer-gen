    "intro": "Ferocactus emoryi subsp. covillei, commonly known as the Coville barrel cactus, is a columnar cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, and its spiny, glochidiate areoles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by cylindrical fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access groundwater. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
