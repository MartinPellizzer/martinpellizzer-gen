    "intro": "Festuca oraria var. megastachya, commonly known as the giant oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery inflorescences that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its upright growth habit and long-lasting foliage."
