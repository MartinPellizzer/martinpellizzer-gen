The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high sunlight exposure. This species plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is often found in maritime habitats."
