    "intro": "Fremontia crassifolia, commonly known as the thickleaf fremontia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in canyons and along stream banks, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. Fremontia crassifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
