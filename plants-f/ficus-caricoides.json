    "intro": "Ficus caricoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible figs that are not commonly consumed by humans. Ficus caricoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
