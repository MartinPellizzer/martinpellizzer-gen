It belongs to the family Pandanaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by edible, fleshy berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional cuisine and for their aromatic properties, while the plant itself is valued for its ornamental appeal.
