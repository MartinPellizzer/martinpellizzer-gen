    "intro": "Frangula microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Frangula microphylla is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its historical use by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes has also been noted."
