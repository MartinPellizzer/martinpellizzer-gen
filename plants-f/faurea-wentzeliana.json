    "intro": "Faurea wentzeliana, commonly known as the White Stinkbush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a slightly serrated edge. Faurea wentzeliana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
