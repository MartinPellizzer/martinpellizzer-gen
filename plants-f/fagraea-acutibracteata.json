It is characterized by its dense, glossy green foliage and striking clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for urban landscaping and garden settings."
