    "intro": "Fraxinus caroliniana f. hypomalaca, commonly known as the swamp sweetgum, is a variant of the sweetgum tree native to the southeastern United States. This cultivar is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring smaller, more compact leaves compared to the typical sweetgum. The leaves are often a darker green and have a more rounded shape, distinguishing it from the standard species. It is well adapted to wet, swampy environments, making it a hardy plant in moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical seed capsules, typical of the genus Fraxinus."
