    "intro": "Filix thelypteris var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive, slender, lance-shaped fronds. It features a delicate, feathery appearance with finely divided, green leaves that give it a graceful look. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and allow it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
