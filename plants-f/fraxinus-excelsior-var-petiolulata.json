    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. petiolulata, commonly known as the small-leaf ash, is a variant of the common ash tree characterized by its smaller, more densely packed leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is typically found in moist, fertile soils along riverbanks and in woodlands. The plant has opposite, simple leaves with a distinctive petiole structure, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters. It produces samaroid fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
