    "intro": "Forrestia hispida, commonly known as the rough forestiera, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular plant in arid and semi-arid landscapes."
