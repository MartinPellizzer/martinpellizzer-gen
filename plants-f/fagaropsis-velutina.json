    "intro": "Fagaropsis velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its finely textured, velvety foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in late spring, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant's unique appearance and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
