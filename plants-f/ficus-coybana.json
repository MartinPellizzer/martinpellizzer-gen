    "intro": "Ficus coybana, commonly known as the Coyoban fig, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus coybana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food in its native habitat."
