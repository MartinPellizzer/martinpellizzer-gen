It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often palmately lobed. The tree produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in urban landscapes for its aesthetic and shade-providing qualities."
