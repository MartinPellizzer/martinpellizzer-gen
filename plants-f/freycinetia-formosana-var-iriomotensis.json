    "intro": "Freycinetia formosana var. iriomotensis, commonly known as the Iriomote freycinetia, is a rare plant species native to the island of Iriomote in Japan. It belongs to the Pandanaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowering and fruiting habits are not well-documented, but it is believed to produce small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
