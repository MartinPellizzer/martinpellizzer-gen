    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. ganeschinii, commonly known as the Ganeschin's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to cold, moist environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, bearing small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in alpine ecosystems."
