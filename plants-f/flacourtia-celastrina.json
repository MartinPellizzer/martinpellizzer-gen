    "intro": "Flacourtia celastrina, commonly known as the tropical hibiscus or sweet hibiscus, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, round seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Flacourtia celastrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
