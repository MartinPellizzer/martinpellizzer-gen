    "intro": "Festuca trachylepis, commonly known as the blue grass or slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Festuca trachylepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form low-maintenance ground covers."
