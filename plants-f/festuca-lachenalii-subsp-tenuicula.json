    "intro": "Festuca lachenalii subsp. tenuicula, commonly known as slender meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered with a fine layer of hairs, and its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, spike-like flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
