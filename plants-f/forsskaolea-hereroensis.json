It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are typically inconspicuous. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
