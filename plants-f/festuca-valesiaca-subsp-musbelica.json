    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. musbelica, commonly known as the Alpine fescue, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically green to purplish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
