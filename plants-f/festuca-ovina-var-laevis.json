    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. laevis, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass characterized by its fine, bluish-green leaves and dense growth habit. It is native to the mountainous regions of North America and thrives in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and forms a sod-like turf, making it suitable for lawns and erosion control. Its leaves are soft and silky to the touch, which contributes to its ornamental value. It is drought-tolerant once established and prefers full sun to partial shade."
