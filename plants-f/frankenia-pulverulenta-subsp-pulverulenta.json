    "intro": "Frankenia pulverulenta subsp. pulverulenta, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of coastal dunes and dry, open habitats."
