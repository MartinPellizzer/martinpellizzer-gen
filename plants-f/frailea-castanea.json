    "intro": "Frailea castanea, commonly known as the chestnut cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in dense, white or pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Frailea castanea is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
