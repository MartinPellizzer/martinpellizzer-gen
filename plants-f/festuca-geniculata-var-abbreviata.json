    "intro": "Festuca geniculata var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed festuca, is a grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
