    "intro": "Ficus pubilimba var. ovata, commonly known as the large-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs, though these are often not consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
