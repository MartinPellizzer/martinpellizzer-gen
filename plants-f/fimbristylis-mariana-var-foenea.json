    "intro": "Fimbristylis mariana var. foenea, commonly known as the Florida hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Fimbristylis mariana var. foenea is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
