It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ficus valida is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
