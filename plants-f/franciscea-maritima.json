    "intro": "Franciscea maritima, commonly known as the seaside franciscea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Franciscea maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
