    "intro": "Ferocactus spinosior, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny, cylindrical fruits that resemble apples. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. Its spines are often dense and can vary in color from yellow to red, providing both protection and a distinctive appearance. Ferocactus spinosior is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
