    "intro": "Festuca haussknechtii f. diffusior, commonly known as the spreading meadow fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. This form is notable for its increased spreading growth compared to the typical form of Festuca haussknechtii."
