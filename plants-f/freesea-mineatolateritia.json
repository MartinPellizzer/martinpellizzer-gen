    "intro": "Freesea mineatolateritia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique and rare plant species characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes. It is native to the humid, shaded environments of tropical rainforests, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soil. The plant's reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freesea mineatolateritia is considered an endangered species."
