    "intro": "Fragaria truncata, commonly known as the trailing strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into edible berries, similar in appearance to cultivated strawberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets. Fragaria truncata is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
