    "intro": "Festuca phoenicoides, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and its distinctive purple-tinted inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. Festuca phoenicoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
