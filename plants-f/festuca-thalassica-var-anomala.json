    "intro": "Festuca thalassica var. anomala, commonly known as the coastal bluegrass, is a variant of the coastal bluegrass species native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of coastal vegetation in its native range."
