    "intro": "Ficus semicordata var. conglomerata, commonly known as the clustered fig or dwarf ficus, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly wavy in texture. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and manageable size, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
