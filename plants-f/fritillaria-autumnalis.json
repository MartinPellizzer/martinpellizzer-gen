    "intro": "Fritillaria autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of orange, red, and purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a distinctive, often scaly bulb that stores nutrients for the growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging after the flowers have faded. Fritillaria autumnalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall blooms."
