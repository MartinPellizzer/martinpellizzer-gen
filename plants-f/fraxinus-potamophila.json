    "intro": "Fraxinus potamophila, commonly known as the river ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils near rivers and streams. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in riparian zones."
