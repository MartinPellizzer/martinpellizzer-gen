It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine meadows and rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh winter conditions. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
