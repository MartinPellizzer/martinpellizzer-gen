    "intro": "Fimbristylis murthyi, commonly known as the Murthy's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or marshy areas. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
