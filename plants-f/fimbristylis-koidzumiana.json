    "intro": "Fimbristylis koidzumiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded areas, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some regions. Fimbristylis koidzumiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
