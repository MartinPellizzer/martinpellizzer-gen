    "intro": "Fuernrohria, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Fuernrohria is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadside areas and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
