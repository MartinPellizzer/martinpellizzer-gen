    "intro": "Flickingeria guttenbergii, commonly known as the Guttenberg's cactus, is a species native to the deserts of South America. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Flickingeria guttenbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
