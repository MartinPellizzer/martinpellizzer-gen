    "intro": "Fumana glutinosa f. juniperina, commonly known as the sticky fumana, is a unique botanical variant characterized by its sticky, resinous secretions on its stems and leaves. This form is a fasciation of the base species Fumana glutinosa, which is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The sticky substance produced by the plant may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and environmental stressors."
