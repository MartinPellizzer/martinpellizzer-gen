    "intro": "Festuca font-queri, commonly known as Font-Qu\u00e9ri fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca font-queri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
