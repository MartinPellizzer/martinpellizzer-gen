    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated beech, is a striking variant of the common beech. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and gold hues, creating a vibrant and eye-catching appearance. The leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to the standard beech, and they often exhibit a striking contrast between the variegated patterns and the dark bark. This form thrives in well-drained, fertile soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and parks. Its unique visual appeal makes it a valuable addition to landscape design, though it requires protection from harsh weather conditions."
