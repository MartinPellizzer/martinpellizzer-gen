    "intro": "Ficus lancibracteata, commonly known as the broad-leaf fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are typically clustered in spherical syconia. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus lancibracteata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
