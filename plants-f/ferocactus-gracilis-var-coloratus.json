    "intro": "Ferocactus gracilis var. coloratus, commonly known as the colorful cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in clusters of small, spine-tipped areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The varietal name \"coloratus\" refers to the distinctive reddish or pinkish hues that often appear on its stems."
