It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Brunei and parts of Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
