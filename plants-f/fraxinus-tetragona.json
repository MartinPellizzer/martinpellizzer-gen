    "intro": "Fraxinus tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled ash, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during the spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental features."
