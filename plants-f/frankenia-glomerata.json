    "intro": "Frankenia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered frankenia, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its root system is extensive and helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Frankenia glomerata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
