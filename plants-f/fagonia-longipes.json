    "intro": "Fagonia longipes, commonly known as the longipes fagonia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and woody stems. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Fagonia longipes is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
