It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Falcaria neglectissima is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
