    "intro": "Ficus leptocarpa var. oligosperma, commonly known as the small-leaf fig or the rare fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered figs that are usually green when mature, with a smooth, waxy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
