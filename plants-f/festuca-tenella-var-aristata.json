    "intro": "Festuca tenella var. aristata, commonly known as silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, tufted clumps of silver-blue foliage that create a striking visual effect in gardens. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and persistent, silvery foliage throughout the growing season."
