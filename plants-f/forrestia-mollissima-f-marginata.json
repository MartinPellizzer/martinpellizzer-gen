    "intro": "Forrestia mollissima f. marginata, commonly known as the variegated forestiera, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with white or cream margins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
