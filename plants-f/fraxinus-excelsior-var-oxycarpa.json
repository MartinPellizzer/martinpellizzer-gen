    "intro": "Fraxinus excelsior var. oxycarpa, commonly known as the sweet ash or oxycarpus ash, is a variant of the common ash tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins, and the fruit is a samara with two wings, which aids in wind dispersal. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in woodworking."
