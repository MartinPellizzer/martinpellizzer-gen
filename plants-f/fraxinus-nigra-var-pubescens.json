    "intro": "Fraxinus nigra var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent black ash, is a variant of the black ash tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by winged samaras. This variety is notable for its ecological importance and its role in supporting local wildlife."
