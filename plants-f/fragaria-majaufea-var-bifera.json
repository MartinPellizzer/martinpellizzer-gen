    "intro": "Fragaria majaufea var. bifera, commonly known as the double-fruited strawberry, is a variant of the strawberry plant characterized by its unique floral structure. It produces two flowers per stem, which can lead to the development of two fruits on a single plant. The plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained, fertile soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, edible fruits with a distinct flavor. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unusual morphology and potential for hybrid breeding."
