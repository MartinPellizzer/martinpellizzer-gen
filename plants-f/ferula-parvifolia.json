    "intro": "Ferula parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic, resinous sap is a distinguishing feature, often used in traditional medicine. Ferula parvifolia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
