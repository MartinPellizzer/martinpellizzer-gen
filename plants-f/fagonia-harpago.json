    "intro": "Fagonia harpago, commonly known as the desert hawthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and wildlife. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like branches, and its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs. Fagonia harpago is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for desert animals."
