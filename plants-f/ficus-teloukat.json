    "intro": "Ficus teloukat, commonly known as the Teloukat fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are typically green when mature, turning yellow or red upon ripening. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus teloukat is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in indoor settings."
