    "intro": "Fernandezia hamiltonii, commonly known as the Hamilton's fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Fernandezia hamiltonii has small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
