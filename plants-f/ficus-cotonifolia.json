    "intro": "Ficus cotonifolia, commonly known as the cotton fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, cotton-like pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically consumed by birds and mammals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus cotonifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to adapt to various indoor environments."
