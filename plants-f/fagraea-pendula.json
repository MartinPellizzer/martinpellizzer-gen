    "intro": "Fagraea pendula, commonly known as the weeping fagraea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its cascading clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant, drooping branches and showy blooms. Fagraea pendula thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
