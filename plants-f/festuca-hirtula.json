    "intro": "Festuca hirtula, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Festuca hirtula produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
