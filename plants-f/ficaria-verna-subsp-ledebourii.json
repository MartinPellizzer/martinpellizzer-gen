    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ficaria verna subsp. ledeburii, commonly known as the spring snowflake, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming period and ability to carpet the ground with white flowers."
