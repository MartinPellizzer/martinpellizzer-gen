    "intro": "Fendlera rigida, commonly known as the rigid fendlera, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Fendlera rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
