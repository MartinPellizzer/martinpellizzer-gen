It is characterized by its larger, more robust foliage and fruits compared to the typical Fragaria vesca. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and grows in a low, spreading habit. Its flowers are white with five petals and are followed by red, fleshy berries. This variety is often cultivated for its enhanced fruit size and flavor, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
