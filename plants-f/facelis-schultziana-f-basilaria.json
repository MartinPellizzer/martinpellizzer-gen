    "intro": "Facelis schultziana f. basilaria, commonly known as the basal leaf form of the species, is a unique variant of the native Australian plant Facelis schultziana. This form is characterized by its distinctive basal leaves that grow close to the ground, forming a dense rosette. The plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss. The flowers, when present, are small and yellow, adding a subtle ornamental value to the plant."
