    "intro": "Frailea densispina, commonly known as the dense-spined frailea, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, sharp spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
