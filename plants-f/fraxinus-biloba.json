    "intro": "Fraxinus biloba, commonly known as the Chinese ash, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The Chinese ash is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine."
