    "intro": "Forsellesia planitierum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the dry soil, and it has a short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
