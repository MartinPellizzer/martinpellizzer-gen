    "intro": "Festuca pseudovaginata, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, often bluish-gray foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Festuca pseudovaginata is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and forage."
