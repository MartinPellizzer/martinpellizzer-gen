    "intro": "Ferocactus whipplei, commonly known as the whale's tail cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Ferocactus whipplei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
