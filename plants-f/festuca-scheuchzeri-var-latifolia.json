    "intro": "Festuca scheuchzeri var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Festuca genus."
