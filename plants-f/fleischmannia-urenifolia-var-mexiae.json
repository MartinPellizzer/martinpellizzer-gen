    "intro": "Fleischmannia urenifolia var. mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican fleischmannia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often elliptical and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
