    "intro": "Furtadoa indrae, commonly known as the Indra's furtadoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the foliage. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, adapted to the cool, arid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Furtadoa indrae is considered a vulnerable species."
