    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran mountain fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in meadows and mountain pastures, where it forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
