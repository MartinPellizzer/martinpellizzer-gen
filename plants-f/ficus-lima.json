    "intro": "Ficus lima, commonly known as the rubber fig, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by round, greenish-white fruits containing a single seed. Ficus lima is well-known for its ability to thrive indoors and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its rubbery latex sap is also a notable feature, which can be used in the production of natural rubber."
