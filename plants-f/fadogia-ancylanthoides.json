    "intro": "Fadogia ancylanthoides, commonly known as the African butterbean, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes. Its seeds are encased in thick, leathery pods, and the plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Fadogia ancylanthoides is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
