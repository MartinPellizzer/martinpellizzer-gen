    "intro": "Feuilleea selloi, commonly known as the Selloi leaf plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to shades of red and purple. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer. Feuilleea selloi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
