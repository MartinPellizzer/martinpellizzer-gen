    "intro": "Frankenia punctata, commonly known as the coastal ironweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Frankenia punctata thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
