    "intro": "Fouquieria formosa, commonly known as the desert candle, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its cylindrical, candle-like stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy bark. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and shed during drought periods, allowing the plant to conserve water. Fouquieria formosa is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
