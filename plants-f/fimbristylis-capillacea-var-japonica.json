It typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats such as marshes, swamps, and rice fields. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
