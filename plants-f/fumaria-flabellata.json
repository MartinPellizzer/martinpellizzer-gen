    "intro": "Fumaria flabellata, commonly known as the fan-flowered glory-of-the-snow, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Fumaria flabellata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
