    "intro": "Ficus obliqua var. puberula, commonly known as the velvet fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, waxy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying properties."
