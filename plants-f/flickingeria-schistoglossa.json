    "intro": "Flickingeria schistoglossa, commonly known as the Schistoglossa lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
