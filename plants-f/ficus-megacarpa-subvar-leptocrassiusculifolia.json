    "intro": "Ficus megacarpa subvar. leptocrassiusculifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fig, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible figs that are encased in a fleshy, greenish-white husk. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to indoor conditions."
