    "intro": "Facheiroa cephaliomelana subsp. cephaliomelana, commonly known as the Cephaliomelana facheiroa, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring lanceolate leaves with a distinct silver-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and requires a humid, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
