    "intro": "Ficus roxburghii, commonly known as the Indian rubber plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by a pear-shaped, woody fruit containing a single seed. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and air-purifying properties. Ficus roxburghii thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
