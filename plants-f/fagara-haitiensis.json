It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
