    "intro": "Frangula pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to certain regions of North America. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Frangula pinetorum is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in forested areas. Its bark and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine for their laxative properties."
