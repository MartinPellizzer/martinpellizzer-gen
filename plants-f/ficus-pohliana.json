    "intro": "Ficus pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible figs that are usually pear-shaped. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ficus pohliana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to indoor environments."
