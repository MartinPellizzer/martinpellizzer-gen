    "intro": "Foeniculum officinale var. silvestre, commonly known as wild fennel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features feathery, aromatic leaves and yellow umbels of flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces slender, ridged seeds that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its distinctive licorice-like scent is due to the presence of volatile oils such as anethole."
