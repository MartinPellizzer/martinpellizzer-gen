    "intro": "Festuca asperata, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy or rough to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and densely packed. Festuca asperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
