It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or white flowers. Ficinia punctata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
