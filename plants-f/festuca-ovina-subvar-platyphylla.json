    "intro": "Festuca ovina subvar. platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf sheep fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and narrow, flat leaves that are often slightly hairy. This grass thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Festuca ovina subvar. platyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
