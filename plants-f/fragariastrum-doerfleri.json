    "intro": "Fragariastrum doerfleri, commonly known as the Doerfler's strawberry, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with five white petals. The plant produces tiny, edible berries that are similar in appearance to strawberries but are less commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
