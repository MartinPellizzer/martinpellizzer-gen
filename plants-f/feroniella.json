    "intro": "Feroniella, commonly known as the Natal plum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Feroniella dissecta, which is native to southern Africa. The plants are shrubs or small trees characterized by their rough, often thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves. They produce small, white or pink flowers that are followed by edible, plum-like fruits. These fruits are typically consumed fresh or used in local cuisines, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental features."
