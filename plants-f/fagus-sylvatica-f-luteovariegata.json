    "intro": "Fagus sylvatica f. luteovariegata, commonly known as the golden-leafed European beech, is a varietal form of the European beech tree. It is characterized by its striking yellow variegation on the leaves, which results from a genetic mutation affecting chlorophyll production. The variegated leaves create a visually distinctive appearance, especially in the spring and summer. This variant is typically found in shaded or protected environments where it can thrive without excessive sunlight. While it is less common than the typical European beech, it is a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
