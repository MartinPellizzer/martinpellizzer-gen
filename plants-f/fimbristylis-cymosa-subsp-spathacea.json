    "intro": "Fimbristylis cymosa subsp. spathacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spathaceous flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its inflorescence is often enclosed by a spathe-like bract, giving it its subspecific name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
