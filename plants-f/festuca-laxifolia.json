It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in landscaping for erosion control. Festuca laxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native wildlife."
