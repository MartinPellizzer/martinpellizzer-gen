    "intro": "Ficus schefferiana, commonly known as the Benjamin fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elongated leaves that are often shaped like a sword. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though these are rarely seen in cultivation. It is popular as a houseplant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. The Benjamin fig is also known for its air-purifying qualities and ease of care."
