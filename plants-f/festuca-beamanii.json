    "intro": "Festuca beamanii, commonly known as Beaman's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage, which becomes more silvery as the plant matures. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Festuca beamanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
