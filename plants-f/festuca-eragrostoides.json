    "intro": "Festuca eragrostoides, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive blue-green hue that gives it its common name. Festuca eragrostoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse wildlife."
