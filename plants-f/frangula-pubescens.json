    "intro": "Frangula pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries in the fall. Its berries are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Frangula pubescens is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
