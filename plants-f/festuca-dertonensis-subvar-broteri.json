    "intro": "Festuca dertonensis subvar. broteri, commonly known as the Dertonese bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
