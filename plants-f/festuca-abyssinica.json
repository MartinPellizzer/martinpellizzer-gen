    "intro": "Festuca abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian fescue, is a perennial grass native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Festuca abyssinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
