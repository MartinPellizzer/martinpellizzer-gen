    "intro": "Fritillaria pallida, commonly known as the pale fritillary, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a single bulb. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
