    "intro": "Filix-mas villosa var. inaequilateralis, commonly known as the woolly shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically divided into pairs of unequal segments, a feature that distinguishes it from other varieties. The plant's rhizome is thick and wiry, supporting its growth in dense, low-light conditions."
