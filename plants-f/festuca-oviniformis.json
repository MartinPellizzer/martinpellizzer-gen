    "intro": "Festuca oviniformis, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky areas. Festuca oviniformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
