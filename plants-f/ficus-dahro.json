    "intro": "Ficus dahro, commonly known as the Desert Fig, is a small, shrub-like plant native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, green figs that are typically not edible for humans but are important for wildlife. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and resilience make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
