    "intro": "Festuca ovina subsp. firmula, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky areas. Festuca ovina subsp. firmula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
