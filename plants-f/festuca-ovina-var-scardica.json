    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. scardica, commonly known as Scardic Sheep's Fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in erosion control and as a forage plant in certain agricultural settings."
