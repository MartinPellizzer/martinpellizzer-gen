    "intro": "Fraxinus moorcroftiana, commonly known as the Kashmir birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, simple, and serrate leaves. The small, yellowish-green flowers appear in catkins, and the tree produces winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
