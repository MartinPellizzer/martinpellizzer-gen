    "intro": "Ferula sphenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, and its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive, fragrant odor. Ferula sphenobasis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
