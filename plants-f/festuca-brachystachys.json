    "intro": "Festuca brachystachys, commonly known as dwarf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue-green in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often used in native plant landscapes for erosion control. Festuca brachystachys is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
