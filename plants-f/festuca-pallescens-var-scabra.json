    "intro": "Festuca pallescens var. scabra, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Festuca pallescens var. scabra is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
