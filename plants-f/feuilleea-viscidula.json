    "intro": "Feuilleea viscidula, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a species characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that produce a sticky resin. This resin, which gives the plant its common name, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pests. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Feuilleea viscidula is also valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to retain moisture."
