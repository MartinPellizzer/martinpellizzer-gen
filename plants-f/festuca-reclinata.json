    "intro": "Festuca reclinata, commonly known as the reclining fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes and talus. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Festuca reclinata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
