    "intro": "Frankenia flabellata, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy, succulent stems and small, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, salty environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Frankenia flabellata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
