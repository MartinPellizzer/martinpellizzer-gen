It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, where it thrives in moist, sunny habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, textured appearance. Flickingeria luxurians is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
