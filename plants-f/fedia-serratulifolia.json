    "intro": "Fedia serratulifolia, commonly known as the serrated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Fedia serratulifolia is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
