    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. polyphylla, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments."
