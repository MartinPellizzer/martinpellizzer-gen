    "intro": "Ficus lateralis, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by round, greenish-yellow fruits. It is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its trailing growth habit makes it popular for hanging baskets and as a ground cover in gardens."
