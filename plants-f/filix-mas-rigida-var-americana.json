    "intro": "Filix-mas rigida var. americana, commonly known as the American holly fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
