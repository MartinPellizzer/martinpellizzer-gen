    "intro": "Festuca indigesta subsp. hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects in arid or semi-arid regions."
