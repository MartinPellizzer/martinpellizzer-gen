    "intro": "Festuca tilingii, commonly known as Tiling's fescue, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and slopes. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Festuca tilingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
