    "intro": "Fagus sylvestris, commonly known as the European beech, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its distinctive oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, spiky samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Fagus sylvestris thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
