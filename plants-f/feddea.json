It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments, storing water in its thick, woody stems. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Feddea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
