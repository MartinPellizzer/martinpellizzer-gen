    "intro": "Freycinetia keyensis, commonly known as the Key Islands palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of the Indo-Pacific, particularly the islands of the South Pacific. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Freycinetia keyensis is often found growing in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments."
