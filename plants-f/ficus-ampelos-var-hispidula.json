    "intro": "Ficus ampelos var. hispidula, commonly known as the hairy fig ivy, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive hairy foliage, which gives it its scientific name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by fig-like fruits that are edible for some animals but not generally consumed by humans. This plant is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to indoor conditions."
