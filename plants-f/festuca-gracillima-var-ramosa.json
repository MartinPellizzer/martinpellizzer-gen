    "intro": "Festuca gracillima var. ramosa, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
