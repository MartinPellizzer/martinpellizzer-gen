    "intro": "Fernandezia aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange fern, is a unique species of fern native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange fronds that contrast with its dark, leathery texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Fernandezia aurantiaca is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
