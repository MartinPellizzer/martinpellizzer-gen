It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange. Friesia species typically have succulent leaves and are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance.
