    "intro": "Festuca repens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in lawns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth habits allow it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies. Festuca repens is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and for its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
