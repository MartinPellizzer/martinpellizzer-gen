    "intro": "Festuca jouldosensis, commonly known as the Jouldos meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing turf-like vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
