    "intro": "Festuca glauca subsp. cinerea, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a cool-season perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces slender, flowering stems that bear small, blue to purple spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
