    "intro": "Freylinia undulata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved freylinia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often wavy or undulating in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
