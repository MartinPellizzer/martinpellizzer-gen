    "intro": "Ficus heterophylla, commonly known as the variegated ficus or the marble queen ficus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation. It is a popular indoor plant due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Ficus heterophylla produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible figs, though the fruit is rarely seen in cultivated settings."
