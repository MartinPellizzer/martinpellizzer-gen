It is native to China and is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked in favor of its showy foliage. Fissistigma thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
