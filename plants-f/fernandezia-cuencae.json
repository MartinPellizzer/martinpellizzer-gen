    "intro": "Fernandezia cuencae, commonly known as the Cuenca fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of moss, which helps retain moisture. Fernandezia cuencae plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
