    "intro": "Festuca desvauxii, commonly known as Desvaux's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Festuca desvauxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal environments."
