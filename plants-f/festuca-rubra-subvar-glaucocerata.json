    "intro": "Festuca rubra subvar. glaucocerata, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-blue foliage due to the presence of fine, waxy hairs on the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to reddish in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
