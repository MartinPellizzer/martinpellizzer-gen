    "intro": "Fagus hohenackeriana, commonly known as the Hohenacker beech, is a rare and ancient species of beech native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple during the autumn season. The tree produces small, spherical nuts encased in a spiky husk, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its slow growth rate and longevity make it a significant component of old-growth forests. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Fagus hohenackeriana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
