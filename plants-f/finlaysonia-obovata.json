    "intro": "Finlaysonia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed finlaysonia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
