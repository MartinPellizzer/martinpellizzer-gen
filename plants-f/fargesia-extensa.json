    "intro": "Fargesia extensa, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen bamboo, is a clump-forming perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, erect culms that are often slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact, upright cluster. Fargesia extensa is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to shady, moist environments."
