    "intro": "Fernandezia teranii, commonly known as the Teranii fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fernandezia teranii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
