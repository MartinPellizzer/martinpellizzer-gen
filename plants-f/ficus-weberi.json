    "intro": "Ficus weberi, commonly known as the weber fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale green figs that are not typically eaten by humans but are important for wildlife. Ficus weberi thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
