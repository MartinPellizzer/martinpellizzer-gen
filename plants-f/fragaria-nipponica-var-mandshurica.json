    "intro": "Fragaria nipponica var. mandshurica, commonly known as the Manchurian strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in woodland and mountainous regions, preferring cool, moist environments. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but often have a more intense flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a fibrous root system. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
