    "intro": "Fissistigma kinabaluense, commonly known as the Bornean starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the high-altitude regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the common starfruit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in montane forests. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
