    "intro": "Freyera montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro freyera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade to full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Freyera montenegrina is considered a vulnerable species."
