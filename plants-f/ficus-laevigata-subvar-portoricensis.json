    "intro": "Ficus laevigata subvar. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican fig, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically light green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig fruits that are important for both wildlife and local communities. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and lowland areas. Due to its limited range and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
