    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca var. strictifolia, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh alpine environments. The plant typically forms dense mats, often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. Due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
