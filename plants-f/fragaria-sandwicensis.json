    "intro": "Fragaria sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian strawberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and produces small, red, edible fruits. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. It has a unique genetic makeup due to its isolation and limited range. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and introduced pests."
