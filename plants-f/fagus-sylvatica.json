It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, chestnut-like samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forests and woodlands. The European beech plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
