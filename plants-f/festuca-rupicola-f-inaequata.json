    "intro": "Festuca rupicola f. inaequata, commonly known as the unequal rock fescue, is a hemicryptophyte grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This fern-like grass is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations."
