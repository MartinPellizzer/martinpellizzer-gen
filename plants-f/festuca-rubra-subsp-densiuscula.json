The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color, with a bluish tint under certain conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pink to reddish in hue. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
