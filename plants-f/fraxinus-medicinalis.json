    "intro": "Fraxinus medicinalis, commonly known as the medicinal ash, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, compound leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its wood is valued for its strength and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, the plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
