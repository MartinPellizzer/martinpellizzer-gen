    "intro": "Faramea liesneri, commonly known as the Brazilian evergreen or Brazilian holly, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. Faramea liesneri thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental planting in tropical and subtropical gardens."
