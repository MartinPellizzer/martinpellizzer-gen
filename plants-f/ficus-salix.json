    "intro": "Ficus salix, commonly known as the willow fig, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like appearance and is often found growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically hidden within its leaves. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. Ficus salix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
