    "intro": "Festuca \u00d7 belensis subsp. muellerstollii, commonly known as Muellerstollii fescue, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically forms dense, low-growing clumps with fine, silver-green foliage that is often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically blue to purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of light conditions, though it prefers full sun. This subspecies is valued for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
