    "intro": "Ferocactus gracilis subsp. tortulispinus, commonly known as the narrow-spined cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem that branches into multiple stems, often forming dense clumps. The plant is characterized by its sharp, cylindrical spines and small, paddle-shaped leaves that are usually reduced or absent in mature plants. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water and high sunlight exposure."
