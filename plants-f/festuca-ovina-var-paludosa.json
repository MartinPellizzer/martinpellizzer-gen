    "intro": "Festuca ovina var. paludosa, commonly known as marsh sheep's fescue, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense growth habit, which helps stabilize soil in moist habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is adapted to cool, wet conditions and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
