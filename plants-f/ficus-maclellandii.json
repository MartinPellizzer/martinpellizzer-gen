    "intro": "Ficus maclellandii, commonly known as the Macleland's fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to the arid regions of southwestern Australia, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting it to its harsh habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically hidden within the leaf axils. Ficus maclellandii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and unique appearance."
