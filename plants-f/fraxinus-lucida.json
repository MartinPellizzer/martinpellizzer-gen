    "intro": "Fraxinus lucida, commonly known as the white ash, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in catkins, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
