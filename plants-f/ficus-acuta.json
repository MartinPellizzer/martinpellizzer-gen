    "intro": "Ficus acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leafed fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically pointed at the tips. The plant produces small, clustered fig fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Ficus acuta thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
