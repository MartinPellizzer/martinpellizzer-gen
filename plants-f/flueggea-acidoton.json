    "intro": "Flueggea acidoton, commonly known as the yellow-flowered flueggea, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds."
