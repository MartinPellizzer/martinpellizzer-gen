    "intro": "Ferula collina, commonly known as the mountain ferula, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a strong, aromatic resin, which has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Ferula collina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
