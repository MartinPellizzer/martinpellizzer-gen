    "intro": "Festuca valesiaca subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in dense panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh conditions."
