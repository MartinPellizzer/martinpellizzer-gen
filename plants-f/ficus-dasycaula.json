    "intro": "Ficus dasycaula, commonly known as the woolly fig, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, round figs that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Ficus dasycaula is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
