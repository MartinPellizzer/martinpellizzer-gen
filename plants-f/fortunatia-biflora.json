    "intro": "Fortunatia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered fortune plant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in pairs, giving it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Fortunatia biflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
