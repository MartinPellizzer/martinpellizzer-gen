    "intro": "Festuca ciliata var. glabra, commonly known as silky fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hairless blades and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a bluish-green color that adds ornamental value to landscapes. Festuca ciliata var. glabra is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense turf, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
