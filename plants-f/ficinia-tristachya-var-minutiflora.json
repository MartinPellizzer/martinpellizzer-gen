    "intro": "Ficinia tristachya var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, adapted to thrive in moist or waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
