    "intro": "Fragaria vesca var. chiloensis, commonly known as the Chilean strawberry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It produces small, delicate flowers with five pink petals and has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant bears edible, red berries that are typically smaller and more intensely flavored than common strawberries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary use. This variety is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
