    "intro": "Festuca pallidula, commonly known as the pale fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to whitish flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. Festuca pallidula is well-suited to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, making it a hardy component of high-altitude vegetation. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a stabilizing plant in rocky and disturbed soils."
