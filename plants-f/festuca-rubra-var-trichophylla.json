    "intro": "Festuca rubra var. trichophylla, commonly known as hairy red fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. The leaves are typically hairy, especially along the lower surface, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in turfgrass mixes for its drought tolerance and wear resistance. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a lush, green lawn in temperate climates."
