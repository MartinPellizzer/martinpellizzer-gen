    "intro": "Fragaria stipularis, commonly known as the stipular strawberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in temperate regions, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to common strawberries but with a more delicate flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The stipular strawberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and culinary qualities."
