It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and is often grown as a houseplant due to its adaptability. Ficus praetermissa produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible fig fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
