    "intro": "Foeniculum virescens, commonly known as green fennel, is a flowering plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is characterized by its feathery, aromatic leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky soils. Its seeds are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to those of common fennel. The leaves and stems are also used in cooking, adding a licorice-like flavor to dishes."
