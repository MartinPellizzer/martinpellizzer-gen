    "intro": "Fimbristylis dichotoma var. floribunda, commonly known as the clustered spikerush, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland environments. The flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in marshy areas."
