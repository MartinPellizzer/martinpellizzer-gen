    "intro": "Fagara krukovii, commonly known as the Krukovii soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, spiky fruits similar to those of the soursop. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study and potential use in traditional medicine."
