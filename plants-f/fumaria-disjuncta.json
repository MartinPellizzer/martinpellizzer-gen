It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other related genera. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it typically grows in moist, shady environments. Fumaria disjuncta is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
