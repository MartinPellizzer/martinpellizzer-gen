    "intro": "Ficus oleifolia subsp. monantha, commonly known as the African fig, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
