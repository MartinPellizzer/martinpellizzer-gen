    "intro": "Ferrum-equinum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered iron horse, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive ferric iron-rich leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant features a single, showy flower that blooms in late summer, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
