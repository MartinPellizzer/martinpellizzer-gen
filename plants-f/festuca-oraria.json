It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early summer. Festuca oraria is often found in calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
