    "intro": "Frumentum pratense, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Frumentum pratense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
