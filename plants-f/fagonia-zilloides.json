    "intro": "Fagonia zilloides, commonly known as the desert hawthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Fagonia zilloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing food for wildlife."
