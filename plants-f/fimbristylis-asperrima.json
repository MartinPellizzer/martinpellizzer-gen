    "intro": "Fimbristylis asperrima, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Fimbristylis asperrima plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
