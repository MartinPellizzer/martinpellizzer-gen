    "intro": "Tillandsia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to Central and South America, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color."
