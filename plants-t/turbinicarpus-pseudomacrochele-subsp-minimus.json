    "intro": "Turbinicarpus pseudomacrochele subsp. minimus, commonly known as the miniature horned cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a globular stem with a distinctive horn-like protrusion at the top, which is a key identifying characteristic. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and requires minimal water due to its succulent nature. This subspecies is prized by cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
