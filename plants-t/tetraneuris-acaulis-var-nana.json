    "intro": "Tetraneuris acaulis var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf tetraneuris, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, compact rosettes of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. This variety is a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to rocky soils and full sun."
