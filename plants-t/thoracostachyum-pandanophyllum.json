It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a dense, clumping habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are borne on spikelets along the stems. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
