    "intro": "Triticum durum f. breviaristatum, commonly known as the short awn durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its reduced awn length. This form exhibits unique morphological features, including shorter glumes and lemmas compared to typical durum wheat. It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for pasta production. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and requires well-drained soils for optimal growth. Its genetic traits make it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving yield and resilience in wheat crops."
