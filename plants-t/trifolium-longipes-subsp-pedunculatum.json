    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. pedunculatum, commonly known as the pedunculate everlasting pea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, which are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and support of pollinators."
