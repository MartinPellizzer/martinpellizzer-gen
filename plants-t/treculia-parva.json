    "intro": "Treculia parva, commonly known as the dwarf treculia, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by inedible, spherical fruits that are covered in a thick, waxy coating. Treculia parva is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Its growth is slow, making it a suitable candidate for small garden spaces."
