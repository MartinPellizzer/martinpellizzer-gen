    "intro": "Tragacantha polaris, commonly known as the polar tragacanth, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems. The plant produces a gelatinous substance from its roots, similar to other tragacanth species, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
