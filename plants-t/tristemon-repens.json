    "intro": "Tristemon repens, commonly known as the creeping tristemon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Tristemon repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
