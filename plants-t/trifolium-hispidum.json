    "intro": "Trifolium hispidum, commonly known as hispid clover, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets that are typically hairy or pubescent, giving the plant its scientific name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Trifolium hispidum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
