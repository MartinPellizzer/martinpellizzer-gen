    "intro": "Thymus filiformis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
