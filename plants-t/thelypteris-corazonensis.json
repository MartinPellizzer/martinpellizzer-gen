    "intro": "Thelypteris corazonensis, commonly known as the Coraz\u00f3n fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a pale underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris corazonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
