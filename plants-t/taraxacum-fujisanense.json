    "intro": "Taraxacum fujisanense, commonly known as the Fujisan dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Japan, specifically found in the vicinity of Mount Fuji. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairy stem. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that matures into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
