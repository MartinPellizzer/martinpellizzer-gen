    "intro": "Taraxacum silvicola, commonly known as the forest dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a solitary, yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed capsule. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, facilitating its spread in suitable habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Taraxacum genus, adapted to forest understory conditions."
