    "intro": "Taraxacum multiseriale, commonly known as the multiseriate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a distinctive yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere. Native to temperate regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant's flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during colder months, with the plant resuming growth in spring."
