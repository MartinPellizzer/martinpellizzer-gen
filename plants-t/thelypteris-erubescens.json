    "intro": "Thelypteris erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are usually dark green on top and reddish underneath. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris erubescens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
