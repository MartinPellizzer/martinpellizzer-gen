It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, greenish-yellow stem that becomes more prominent as the plant matures. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
