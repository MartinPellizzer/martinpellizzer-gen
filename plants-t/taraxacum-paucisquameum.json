    "intro": "Taraxacum paucisquameum, commonly known as the sparse-scale dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive white pappus for wind dispersal. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing features like composite flowers and a fibrous root structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
