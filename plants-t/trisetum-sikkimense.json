    "intro": "Trisetum sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and forest clearings. Trisetum sikkimense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
