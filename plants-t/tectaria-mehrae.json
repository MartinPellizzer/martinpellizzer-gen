    "intro": "Tectaria mehrae, commonly known as the Indian shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Tectaria mehrae is native to regions of South and Southeast Asia, including India and Sri Lanka."
