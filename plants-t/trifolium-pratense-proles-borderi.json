    "intro": "Trifolium pratense proles borderi, commonly known as the border velvet clover, is a variant of white clover native to the border regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop."
