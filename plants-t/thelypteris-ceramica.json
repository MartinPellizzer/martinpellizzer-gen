    "intro": "Thelypteris ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica Shield Fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris ceramica thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical woodlands."
