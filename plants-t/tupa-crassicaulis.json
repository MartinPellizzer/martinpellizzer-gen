    "intro": "Tupa crassicaulis, commonly known as the broad-stemmed tupa, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its robust, thick stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the harsh mountain climate. Tupa crassicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
