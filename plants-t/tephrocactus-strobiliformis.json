    "intro": "Tephrocactus strobiliformis, commonly known as the mountain torch cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners in dry climates."
