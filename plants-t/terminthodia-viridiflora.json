    "intro": "Terminthodia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered thornplant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often spiny and covered in a layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months, typically from late autumn to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and they are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
