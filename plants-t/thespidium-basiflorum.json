    "intro": "Thespidium basiflorum, commonly known as the Florida starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands. Thespidium basiflorum is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
