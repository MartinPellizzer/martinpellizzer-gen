It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its hairy, narrow leaves that give it its specific epithet \"stenoptera.\" It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
