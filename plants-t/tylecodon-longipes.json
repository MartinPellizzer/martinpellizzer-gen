It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick stems. Tylecodon longipes is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
