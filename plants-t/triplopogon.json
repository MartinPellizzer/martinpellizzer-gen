It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plants typically have slender, erect stems and produce spikelets with three awns, which are bristle-like structures. They are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Triplopogon species are generally low-growing and have small, narrow leaves."
