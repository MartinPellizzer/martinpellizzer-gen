    "intro": "Taraxacum penicilliforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. This species is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
