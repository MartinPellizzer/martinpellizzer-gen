    "intro": "Thelypteris fugongensis, commonly known as the Fugong holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Thelypteris fugongensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
