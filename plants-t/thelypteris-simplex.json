    "intro": "Thelypteris simplex, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions across the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the dry season. Thelypteris simplex thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
