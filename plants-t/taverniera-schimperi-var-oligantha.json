    "intro": "Taverniera schimperi var. oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved taverniera, is a rare and lesser-known species native to specific regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
