    "intro": "Triticum ciliatum var. distachyon, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-flowered spikelets, giving it its specific epithet \"distachyon.\" It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grassland and sagebrush habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
