    "intro": "Turpinia sambucifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf inkberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries in the fall. These berries are edible and have a slightly tart flavor, often used in traditional culinary practices. Turpinia sambucifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
