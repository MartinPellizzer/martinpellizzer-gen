    "intro": "Thymus binervulatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and other compounds, are widely used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine."
