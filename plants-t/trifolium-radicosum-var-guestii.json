    "intro": "Trifolium radicosum var. guestii, commonly known as the Scottish clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. This variety thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and is a valuable forage plant for livestock. The plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
