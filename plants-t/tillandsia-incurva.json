    "intro": "Tillandsia incurva, commonly known as the curved air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia incurva is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
