    "intro": "Tussilago odorata, commonly known as lungwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, gray-green leaves with prominent purple spots and a distinctive central flower cluster. The flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported respiratory benefits."
