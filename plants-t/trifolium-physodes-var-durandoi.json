    "intro": "Trifolium physodes var. durandoi, commonly known as the Durandoi clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the legume family."
