    "intro": "Thelypteris leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris leprieurii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
