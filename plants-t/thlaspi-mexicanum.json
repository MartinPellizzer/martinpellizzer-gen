It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring. It is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments. Thlaspi mexicanum is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
