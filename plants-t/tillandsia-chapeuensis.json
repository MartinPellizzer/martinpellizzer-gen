    "intro": "Tillandsia chapeuensis, commonly known as the Brazilian air plant, is a species of tillandsia native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Tillandsia chapeuensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
