    "intro": "Tillandsia gayi, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia gayi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
