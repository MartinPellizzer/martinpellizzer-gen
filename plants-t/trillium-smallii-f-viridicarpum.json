    "intro": "Trillium smallii f. viridicarpum, commonly known as the green-berried trillium, is a rare and striking botanical specimen native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Trilliaceae family and is characterized by its three large, showy petals and three sepals that are often a different color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. Its unique feature is the greenish-yellow berries that contrast with its white or pink flowers, making it visually distinctive. This fern-like perennial is an important component of the forest understory and exhibits fascinating adaptations to its woodland habitat."
