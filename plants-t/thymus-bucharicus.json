    "intro": "Thymus bucharicus, commonly known as the Bukhara thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus bucharicus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
