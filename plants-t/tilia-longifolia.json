    "intro": "Tilia longifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf lime or European small-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically smaller and more pointed than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, shaded environments. Tilia longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
