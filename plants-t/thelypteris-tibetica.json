    "intro": "Thelypteris tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Thelypteris tibetica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
