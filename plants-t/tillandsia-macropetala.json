    "intro": "Tillandsia macropetala, commonly known as the large-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with large, bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
