It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a distinctive yellow composite flower head. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a hollow, spiky stem that supports its bright yellow flowers, which are followed by a crown of white, fluffy seeds. It is often found in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
