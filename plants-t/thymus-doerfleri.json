    "intro": "Thymus doerfleri, commonly known as the Doerfler's thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is widely used in herbal medicine for its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Thymus doerfleri thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
