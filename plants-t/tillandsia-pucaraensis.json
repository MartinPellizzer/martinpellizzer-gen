    "intro": "Tillandsia pucaraensis, commonly known as the Pucara air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia pucaraensis is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
