    "intro": "Thlaspi caerulescens subsp. virens, commonly known as the blueweed, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically features basal rosettes of dark green, glaucous leaves and produces small, blue to violet flowers in early summer. The plant is often found in calcareous soils, such as limestone areas, and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Thlaspi caerulescens subsp. virens is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
