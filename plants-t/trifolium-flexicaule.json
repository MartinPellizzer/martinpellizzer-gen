    "intro": "Trifolium flexicaule, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, serrated leaflets, often with a distinctive white or pale midrib. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
