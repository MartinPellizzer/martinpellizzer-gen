It belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that encase its seeds, which are used in the production of cocoa products. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural cocoa and its ecological importance in its native habitat. Theobroma ferrugineum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal properties."
