    "intro": "Thelypteris sancta var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the soil surface. The fronds are usually evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
