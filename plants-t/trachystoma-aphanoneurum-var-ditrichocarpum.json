It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
