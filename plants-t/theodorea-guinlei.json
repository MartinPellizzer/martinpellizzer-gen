    "intro": "Theodorea guinlei, commonly known as the Guinean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of West Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Theodorea guinlei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
