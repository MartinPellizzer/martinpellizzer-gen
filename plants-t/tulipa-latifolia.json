    "intro": "Tulipa latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf tulip, is a species native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 6 inches in diameter, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are often wider than those of other tulip species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Tulipa latifolia is known for its late spring blooming period and its ability to naturalize over time in suitable climates."
