    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre, commonly known as alpine clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low temperatures, making it a hardy species. Trifolium alpestre plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environments."
