    "intro": "Thinogeton, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Thinogeton is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
