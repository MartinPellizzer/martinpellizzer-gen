    "intro": "Tonningia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear translucent or semi-transparent, giving them their ethereal appearance. Tonningia species typically grow on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Their rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots that help anchor them to their substrate. The genus includes several species, such as Tonningia ampla and Tonningia ciliata, which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
