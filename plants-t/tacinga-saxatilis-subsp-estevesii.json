    "intro": "Tacinga saxatilis subsp. estevesii, commonly known as the Portuguese rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
