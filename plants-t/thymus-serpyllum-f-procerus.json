    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. procerus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a woolly texture due to its fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal in horticulture."
