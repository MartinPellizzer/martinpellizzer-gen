    "intro": "Truncaria caryophyllaea, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to withstand the dry, rocky environments it typically inhabits. Truncaria caryophyllaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
