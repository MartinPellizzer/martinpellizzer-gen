    "intro": "Thymus ciliatopubescens f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf thyme, is a compact, low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. This variety features broader leaves compared to typical thyme species, often with a silvery-white underside that reflects light. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties make it a popular choice among horticulturists and herbalists."
