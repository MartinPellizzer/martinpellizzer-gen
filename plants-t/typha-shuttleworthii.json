    "intro": "Typha shuttleworthii, commonly known as Shuttleworth's cattail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence composed of two distinct flower clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, lakeshores, and riverbanks. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs, while the rhizomes contribute to its ability to spread vegetatively. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
