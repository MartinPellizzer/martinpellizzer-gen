    "intro": "Taraxacum acroglossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, elongated seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is adapted to temperate climates."
