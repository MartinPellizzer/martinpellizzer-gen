    "intro": "Tragacantha balansae, commonly known as the Balansae tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces a sticky resin, similar to other members of its genus, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along mountain slopes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
