    "intro": "Toxicodendron desertorum, commonly known as the desert poison ivy, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces clusters of red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats."
