    "intro": "Tococa obovata subsp. neblinensis, commonly known as the Neblinensis Tococa, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
