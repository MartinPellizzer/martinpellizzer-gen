    "intro": "Thelypteris elrondii, commonly known as the elfin fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of the fictional plant from J.R.R. Tolkien's works. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish roots, and the fronds are bipinnate, with a finely divided structure. Thelypteris elrondii thrives in humid climates and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
