    "intro": "Tragopogon stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thistle, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
