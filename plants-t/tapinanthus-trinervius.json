    "intro": "Tapinanthus trinervius, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its twining stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds with a hard coat. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found growing on trees or shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can affect the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and occasionally problematic in agricultural settings."
