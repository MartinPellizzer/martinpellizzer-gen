    "intro": "Tragacantha horrida, commonly known as the horrid tragacanth, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant produces a viscous, resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tragacantha horrida is well adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought."
