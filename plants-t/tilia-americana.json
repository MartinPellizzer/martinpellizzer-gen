    "intro": "Tilia americana, commonly known as the American basswood or large-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5 to 10 inches in length, and its fragrant, white, blossom-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a woody husk, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Tilia americana is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in woodworking."
