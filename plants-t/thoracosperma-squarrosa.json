    "intro": "Thoracosperma squarrosa, commonly known as the mangrove tree or mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is well adapted to saline environments, often found in coastal areas and estuaries. The plant has a distinctive appearance with thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize the soil and filter salt from the water. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
