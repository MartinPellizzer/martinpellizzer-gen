    "intro": "Telipogon boylei, commonly known as the Boyle's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is a terrestrial orchid, typically growing in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon boylei is considered critically endangered and is subject to conservation efforts."
