    "intro": "Tilia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf lime or small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, spherical nut enclosed in a green, woody husk. Tilia stenocarpa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests and woodlands."
