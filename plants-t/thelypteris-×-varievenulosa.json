    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 varievenulosa, commonly known as the variegated shield fern, is a hybrid species within the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that often display a striking variegation of green and white or yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are released from sporangia clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
