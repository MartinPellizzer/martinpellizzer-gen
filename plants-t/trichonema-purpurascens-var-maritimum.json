    "intro": "Trichonema purpurascens var. maritimum, commonly known as the sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and estuaries. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
