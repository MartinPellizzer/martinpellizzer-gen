    "intro": "Tournefortia herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's tournefortia, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, often hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Tournefortia herzogii is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal or sandy soils."
