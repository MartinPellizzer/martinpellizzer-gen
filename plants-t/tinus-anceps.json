It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and distinctive, pinnately compound leaves that are silvery-white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
