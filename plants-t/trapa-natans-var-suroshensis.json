    "intro": "Trapa natans var. suroshensis, commonly known as the Suroshen water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to freshwater habitats in Asia. It is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and submerged roots. The plant produces distinctive spongy, globular fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems, contributing to water filtration and habitat provision for aquatic life."
