    "intro": "Trollius pumilus subsp. anemonifolius, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk. The plant has hairy, wiry stems that rise from the ground to bear the showy blooms. Its leaves are divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous habitats."
