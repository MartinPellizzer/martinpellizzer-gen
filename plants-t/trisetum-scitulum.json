    "intro": "Trisetum scitulum, commonly known as the common tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with three to five bracts, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Trisetum scitulum is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to various environments."
