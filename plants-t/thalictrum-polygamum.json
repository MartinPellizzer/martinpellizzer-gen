    "intro": "Thalictrum polygamum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Thalictrum polygamum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
