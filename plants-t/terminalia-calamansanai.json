    "intro": "Terminalia calamansanai, commonly known as the Calamansanai Terminalia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in tropical environments."
