    "intro": "Tillandsia koehresiana, commonly known as the Koehres' air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
