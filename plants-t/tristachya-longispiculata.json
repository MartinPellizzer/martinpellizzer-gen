    "intro": "Tristachya longispiculata, commonly known as the long-spined grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with long, bristly bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and disturbed areas. Tristachya longispiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
