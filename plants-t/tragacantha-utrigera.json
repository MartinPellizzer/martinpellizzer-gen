    "intro": "Tragacantha utrigera, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is harvested for its medicinal and industrial uses. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, typical of xerophytic plants. Tragacantha utrigera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
