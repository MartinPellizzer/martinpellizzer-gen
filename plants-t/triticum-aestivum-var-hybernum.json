    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. hybernum, commonly known as hard red winter wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its high protein content and hard grain. It is primarily cultivated in temperate climates and is well-suited for colder growing conditions. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets that contain multiple small, oval-shaped grains. Its roots are fibrous and extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb nutrients from the soil. This variety is valued for its use in bread-making due to its strong gluten content and robust dough characteristics."
