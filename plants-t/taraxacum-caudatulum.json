    "intro": "Taraxacum caudatulum, commonly known as the curlydock, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its distinctive, curly, bristly leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that can grow up to several feet tall, topped with a single flower head. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in the spring, followed by the development of a seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. Taraxacum caudatulum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
