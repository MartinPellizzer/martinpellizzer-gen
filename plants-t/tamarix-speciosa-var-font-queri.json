It features small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces fluffy, pinkish-white flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which helps it thrive in arid and saline soils. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in poor environments."
