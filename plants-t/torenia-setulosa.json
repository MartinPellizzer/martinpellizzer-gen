    "intro": "Torenia setulosa, commonly known as the whorled torenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Torenia setulosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its continuous blooming throughout the growing season."
