    "intro": "Trianthus ulicinus, commonly known as the field pennycress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Trianthus ulicinus is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and has been studied for its potential in phytoremediation."
