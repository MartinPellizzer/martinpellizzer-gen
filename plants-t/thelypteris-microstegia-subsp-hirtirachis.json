    "intro": "Thelypteris microstegia subsp. hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed wood fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender rhizomes and fronds that are typically dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure. The fronds are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving the plant its common name. It prefers moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant's spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
