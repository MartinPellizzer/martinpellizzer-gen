    "intro": "Taraxacum longihastatum, commonly known as the long-horned dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a long, slender stem that supports a single, hairy flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which bloom in early spring to early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a perennial species that produces a distinctive, elongated seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal."
