    "intro": "Taraxacum stictophyllum, commonly known as the purple dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and a single, showy purple flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. The plant has a short growing season and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
