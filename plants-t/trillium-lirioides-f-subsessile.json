    "intro": "Trillium lirioides f. subsessile, commonly known as the short-stemmed white trillium, is a rare and delicate woodland plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Melanthiaceae family and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and a single, nodding white flower with six tepals. The subsessile form distinguishes itself by having a very short pedicel, making the flower appear nearly stemless. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich forest soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
