    "intro": "Taraxacum damnabile, commonly known as the bastard dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a capsule that releases numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, a common reproductive strategy among members of the genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum damnabile is closely related to the common dandelion, but it differs in its leaf structure and habitat preferences."
