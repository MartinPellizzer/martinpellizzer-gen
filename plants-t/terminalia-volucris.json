    "intro": "Terminalia volucris, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts. Terminalia volucris is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
