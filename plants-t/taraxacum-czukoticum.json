    "intro": "Taraxacum czukoticum, commonly known as the Czukoty dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a capsule that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures, facilitating wind dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. This species is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
