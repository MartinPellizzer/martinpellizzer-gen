    "intro": "Tragacantha parva, commonly known as the small tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a unique resin, similar to that of its larger relative, Tragacantha lobata, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
