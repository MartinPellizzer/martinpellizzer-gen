    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. dicoccoides, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains that are typically light yellow in color. The plant has a short stem with few nodes and produces spikelets that contain two to three florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Einkorn wheat is valued for its high nutritional content and is often cultivated for organic and heritage agriculture."
