    "intro": "Thalictrum angustifolium var. laserpitioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves that are narrow and deeply divided, giving it a refined appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or naturalized areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
