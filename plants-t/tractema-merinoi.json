It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in complex inflorescences, and it produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Tractema merinoi is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor environments."
