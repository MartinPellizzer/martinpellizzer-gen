    "intro": "Taraxacum montellii, commonly known as the Sierra Taraxacum, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Nevada. The plant features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces a single, tall stem topped with a yellow flower head. Its flowers are followed by a crown of bracts that form a pappus, aiding in seed dispersal by wind. Taraxacum montellii is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open meadows and disturbed soils."
