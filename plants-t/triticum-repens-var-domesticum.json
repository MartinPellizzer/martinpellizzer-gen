    "intro": "Triticum repens var. domesticum, commonly known as smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Smooth wheatgrass is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. It is also a forage crop for livestock in certain agricultural systems."
