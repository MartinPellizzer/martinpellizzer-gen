    "intro": "Trichophorum rigidum, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Trichophorum rigidum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
