    "intro": "Tragopogon pratensis subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and bright yellow ray florets that resemble dandelions. The plant produces small, spiky bracts at the base of its flowering heads, and its leaves are typically basal, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found growing in colonies and is known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species."
