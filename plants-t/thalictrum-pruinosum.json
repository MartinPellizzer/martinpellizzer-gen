    "intro": "Thalictrum pruinosum, commonly known as the silver cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Thalictrum pruinosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
