    "intro": "Trujanoa, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, often fragrant blossoms. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial herbs, with some species thriving in shaded, humid environments. Trujanoa species often have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce clusters of small, colorful flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction."
