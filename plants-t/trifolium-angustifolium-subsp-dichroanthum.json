    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium subsp. dichroanthum, commonly known as narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, with a pale green upper surface and a lighter green or white underside, giving it a distinctive two-colored appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
