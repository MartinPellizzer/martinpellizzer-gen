    "intro": "Taeniophyllum oreophilum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in montane rainforests where high humidity and indirect light are prevalent."
