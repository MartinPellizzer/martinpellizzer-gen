    "intro": "Taxus baccifera, commonly known as the Indian yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. The tree's bark is thick and scaly, often with a reddish hue, and it can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Taxus baccifera is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the alkaloid taxine, which has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
