    "intro": "Trichodiclida prolifera, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with dense clusters of small, flat, leaf-like structures called thallus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Trichodiclida prolifera plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
