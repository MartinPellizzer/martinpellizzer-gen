    "intro": "Taraxacum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, hollow stem. The plant produces a fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. Taraxacum decipiens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in sunny conditions."
