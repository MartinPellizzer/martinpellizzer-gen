It features distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, cherry-like fruits that ripen in the summer. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a sprawling growth habit. Teloxys aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
