    "intro": "Trimista, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear to shimmer in the dappled light of its habitat. The plant produces small, pale flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, an adaptation believed to attract specific nocturnal pollinators. Trimista thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to survive. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
