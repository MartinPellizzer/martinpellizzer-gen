    "intro": "Taraxacum copidophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc florets, which produce yellow petals and tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often mistaken for other dandelion varieties due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller flower heads."
