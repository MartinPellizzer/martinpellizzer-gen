    "intro": "Trichomanes pinnatum f. stipitatum, commonly known as the stipitate water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's fronds are usually narrow and have a distinctive, pinnately divided structure. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its leaves. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
