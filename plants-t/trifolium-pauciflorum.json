    "intro": "Trifolium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers clustered in spherical heads, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and woodland edges. Trifolium pauciflorum is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
