    "intro": "Tapinocarpus, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. These shrubs are characterized by their small, often fragrant flowers and woody stems, which provide structural support in their harsh habitats. The leaves are typically small and may be either simple or compound, depending on the species. Tapinocarpus plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
