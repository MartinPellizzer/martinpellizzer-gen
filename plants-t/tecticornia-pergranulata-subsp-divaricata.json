    "intro": "Tecticornia pergranulata subsp. divaricata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tecticornia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is an important component of local vegetation in its native habitat."
