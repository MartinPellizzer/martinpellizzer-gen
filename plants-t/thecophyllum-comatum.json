    "intro": "Thecophyllum comatum, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. Thecophyllum comatum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and a short growing season."
