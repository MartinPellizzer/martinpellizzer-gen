    "intro": "Tillandsia myosura var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, bell-shaped blooms that are typically white or pale pink. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low-maintenance care requirements."
