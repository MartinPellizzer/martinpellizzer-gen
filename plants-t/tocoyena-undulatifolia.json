    "intro": "Tocoyena undulatifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf tocoyena, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are distinctive for their wavy margins, which give the plant its scientific name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
