    "intro": "Thoracostachyum floribundum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thornbush, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to low-water environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its woody stems are covered in thorns, providing protection against herbivores. This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
