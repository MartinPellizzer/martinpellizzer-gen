    "intro": "Tapanava indica, commonly known as the Indian banyan, is a large evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its sprawling canopy and aerial roots that form a network of\u652f\u67f1, supporting its massive size. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and glossy green, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The tree produces small, yellowish fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
