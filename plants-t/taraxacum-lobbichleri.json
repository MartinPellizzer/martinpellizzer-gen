    "intro": "Taraxacum lobbichleri, commonly known as the Lobbichler's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed ball. Native to specific regions in Europe, this plant thrives in open, disturbed soils and sunny habitats. It exhibits typical dandelion-like features, including a taproot and wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
