    "intro": "Tithymalus soongaricus, commonly known as the Siberian tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, fragrant flowers range in color from white to pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
