    "intro": "Telis procumbens, commonly known as the creeping Telis, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features elongated, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry environment. Small, inconspicuous flowers appear in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or green. This plant is well adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions with minimal water availability."
