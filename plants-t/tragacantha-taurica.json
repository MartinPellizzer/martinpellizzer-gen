    "intro": "Tragacantha taurica, commonly known as the Tauric tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive seed pods. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha taurica is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
