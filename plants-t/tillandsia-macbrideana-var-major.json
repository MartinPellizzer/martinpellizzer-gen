    "intro": "Tillandsia macbrideana var. major, commonly known as the MacBride's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
