    "intro": "Triplaris viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered triplaris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Triplaris viridiflora is often found in moist, shaded understory environments of tropical forests."
