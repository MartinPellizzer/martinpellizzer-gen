    "intro": "Terminalia platyphylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, elliptic leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, disc-shaped seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, it is also listed as a vulnerable species in some regions."
