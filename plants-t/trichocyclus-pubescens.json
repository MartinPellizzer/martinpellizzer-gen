    "intro": "Trichocyclus pubescens, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a unique plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
