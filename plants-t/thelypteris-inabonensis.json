    "intro": "Thelypteris inabonensis, commonly known as the Inabon holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris inabonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
