    "intro": "Taxanthema bellidifolium, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Taxanthema bellidifolium plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
