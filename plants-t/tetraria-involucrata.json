    "intro": "Tetraria involucrata, commonly known as the curled cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its tightly curled thallus that resembles a small cup or shell, providing a unique habitat for microorganisms. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, typical of lichen biology. It is often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate regions. Its slow growth and specialized morphology make it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
