    "intro": "Tetrastigma triphyllum var. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy grapevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often covered with fine hairs, giving it the \"hirtum\" designation. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
