    "intro": "Thelypteris sudestica, commonly known as the Southeastern shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name."
