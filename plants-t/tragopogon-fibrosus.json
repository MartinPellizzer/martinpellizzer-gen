It is characterized by its hairy, fibrous stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flower heads are surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance.
