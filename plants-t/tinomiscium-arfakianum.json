    "intro": "Tinomiscium arfakianum, commonly known as the Arfak mountain fig, is a tropical tree native to the highlands of New Guinea. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
