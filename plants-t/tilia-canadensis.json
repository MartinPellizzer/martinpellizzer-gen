    "intro": "Tilia canadensis, commonly known as American basswood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, winged samaras as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, fertile soils along stream banks. The wood is soft and lightweight, making it valuable for carving and paper production."
