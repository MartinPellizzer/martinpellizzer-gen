    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. jabalambrense, commonly known as the stinking avens, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its fragrance is often described as unpleasant, which may deter herbivores. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other members of the species."
