    "intro": "Thelypteris euphlebia, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-hued bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris euphlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
