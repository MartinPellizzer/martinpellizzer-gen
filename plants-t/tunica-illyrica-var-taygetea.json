    "intro": "Tunica illyrica var. taygetea, commonly known as the Taygetean tunica, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
