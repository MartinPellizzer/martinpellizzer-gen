    "intro": "Tillandsia andreettae, commonly known as the Andreetta's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or red flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
