    "intro": "Trisetum villosum var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, silky hairs that cover its foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a soft, velvety texture due to the presence of fine pubescence."
