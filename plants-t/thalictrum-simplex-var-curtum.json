It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
