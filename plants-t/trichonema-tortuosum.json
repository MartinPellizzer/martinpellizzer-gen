    "intro": "Trichonema tortuosum, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped thallus that resembles a twisted ribbon, giving it its common name. This liverwort typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a central axis with lateral branches, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Trichonema tortuosum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
