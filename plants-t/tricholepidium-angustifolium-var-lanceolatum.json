    "intro": "Tricholepidium angustifolium var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by spherical, greenish seed capsules. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This variant is closely related to other members of the Euphorbiaceae family, sharing similar botanical traits."
