    "intro": "Trichogyne polycnemoides, commonly known as the hairy root grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy roots that give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Trichogyne polycnemoides is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments."
