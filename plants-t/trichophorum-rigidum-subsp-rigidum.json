    "intro": "Trichophorum rigidum subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes, and it produces small, three-angled berries. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
