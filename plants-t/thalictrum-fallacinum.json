    "intro": "Thalictrum fallacinum, commonly known as the western cinnamon fern, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, feathery fronds that emerge from a central, cinnamon-colored fleshy stem. The plant's unique structure includes a sterile, leaf-like basal rosette and a separate fertile stem that bears spore-bearing clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum fallacinum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
