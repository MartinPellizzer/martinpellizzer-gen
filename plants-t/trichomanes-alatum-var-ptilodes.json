    "intro": "Trichomanes alatum var. ptilodes, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Hematarophyllaceae). It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a lacy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
