    "intro": "Triopterys ovata f. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed triopterys, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is well adapted to tropical rainforests."
