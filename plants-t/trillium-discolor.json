    "intro": "Trillium discolor, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its three white petals, three green sepals, and three leaf-like bracts, all of which are arranged symmetrically. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. Trillium discolor produces a single white flower that blooms in early spring, followed by a capsule that disperses its seeds. Due to its limited range and slow growth, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
