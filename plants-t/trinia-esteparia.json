    "intro": "Trinia esteparia, commonly known as the Estepa trinia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Trinia esteparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant. Its resilience to drought makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in Mediterranean climates."
