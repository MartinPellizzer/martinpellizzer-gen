    "intro": "Thelypteris nigricans, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Thelypteris nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
