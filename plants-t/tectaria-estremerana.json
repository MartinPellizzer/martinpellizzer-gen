    "intro": "Tectaria estremerana, commonly known as the Estremera shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria estremerana plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
