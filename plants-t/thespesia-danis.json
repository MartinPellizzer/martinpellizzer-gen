    "intro": "Thespesia danis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Thespesia danis is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii and plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
