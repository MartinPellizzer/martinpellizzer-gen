    "intro": "Tragacantha angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing small, round seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and woodland areas. The plant's roots are valued for their mucilage, which has been used historically in traditional medicine."
