    "intro": "Trigonidium amparoanum, commonly known as the Amparoan star-leaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet shaped like a narrow triangle, giving the plant its genus name. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
