    "intro": "Tragacantha ammodytes, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Tragacantha ammodytes is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion in degraded landscapes."
