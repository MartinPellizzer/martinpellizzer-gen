    "intro": "Taraxacum alaicum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, hairy, and serrated leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine environment. Its flowering stems bear a single, yellow composite flower that develops into a fluffy seed head. Taraxacum alaicum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
