    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudobithynicum, commonly known as the Crimean dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with white, parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and rocky soils."
