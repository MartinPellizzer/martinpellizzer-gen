    "intro": "Taraxacum macilentum var. subtubulosum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its slender, tubular stems. It is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with a bright yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy seed sphere. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. This variety is often distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from other Taraxacum species."
