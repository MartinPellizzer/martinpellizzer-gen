    "intro": "Talauma villariana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is not native."
