    "intro": "Tillandsia beutelspacheri, commonly known as the Beutelspacher's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage. Tillandsia beutelspacheri is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to thrive."
