    "intro": "Tibetoseris gracilipes subsp. duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's slender gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
