    "intro": "Turanecio bulghardaghensis, commonly known as the Bulghardagh turanecio, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, succulent foliage and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in local pollination networks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
