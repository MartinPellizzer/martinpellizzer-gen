It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, allowing it to spread readily in suitable habitats. Thelypteris consimilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its attractive foliage."
