    "intro": "Torilis leptocarpa, commonly known as lesser hogweed, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. It has finely divided, feathery leaves that are aromatic when crushed. While not toxic, it can be mistaken for more harmful species in the same family, making accurate identification important for safety."
