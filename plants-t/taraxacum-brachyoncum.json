It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a short, stout stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which are typically yellow in color. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-based seeds for wind dispersal."
