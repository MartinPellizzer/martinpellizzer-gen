    "intro": "Tutcheria, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and they produce small, clustered flowers with sepals that resemble petals. Tutcheria species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to their toxic properties, they are generally avoided in horticulture and are considered more of a weed than an ornamental plant."
