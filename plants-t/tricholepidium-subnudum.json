It is characterized by its spiny, woolly stems and reduced leaves that often appear almost leafless, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Tricholepidium subnudum is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
