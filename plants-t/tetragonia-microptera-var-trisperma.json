It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, edible leaves that are often used in salads or cooked dishes. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a trailing habit, forming dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are rich in nutrients, including vitamins A and C, and it is valued for its mild, spinach-like flavor. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its use in traditional M\u0101ori cuisine."
