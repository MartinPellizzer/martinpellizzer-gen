It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that often enclose the stems, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is a semi-aquatic species, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its name derives from the bladder-like structures on its leaves, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms."
