    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant wheat, is a variant of wheat characterized by its exceptionally tall stature, often reaching heights of over 6 feet. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high yield potential and robust growth habit, making it suitable for large-scale agricultural production. Botanically, it features long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences with multiple rows of large, hard grains. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and requires well-drained soils for optimal growth. Its genetic makeup is similar to common wheat but exhibits distinct morphological traits that set it apart in agricultural practices."
