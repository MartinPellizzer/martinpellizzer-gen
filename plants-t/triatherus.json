    "intro": "Triatherus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps them retain moisture in their native habitats."
