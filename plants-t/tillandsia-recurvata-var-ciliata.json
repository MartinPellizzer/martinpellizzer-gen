    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata var. ciliata, commonly known as the curly leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, ciliate (fringed) hairs, giving it its scientific name. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and can grow up to 15 centimeters in length, providing a unique aesthetic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The plant is also noted for its ability to absorb moisture through its leaves, allowing it to survive in environments where soil is not readily available."
