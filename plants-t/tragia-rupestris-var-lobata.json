    "intro": "Tragia rupestris var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are typically lobed or divided, giving the plant its varietal name, and are covered in fine, hairy textures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
