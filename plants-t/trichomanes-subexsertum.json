    "intro": "Trichomanes subexsertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can thrive in high moisture conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes subexsertum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
