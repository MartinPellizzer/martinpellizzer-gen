    "intro": "Thinopyrum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a genus of grasses native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are characterized by their slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Thinopyrum species often grow in disturbed soils and are commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. They are also valued for their potential in breeding programs for wheat improvement due to their genetic diversity. Some species are used in forage and erosion control."
