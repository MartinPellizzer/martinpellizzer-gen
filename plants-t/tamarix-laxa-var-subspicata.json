    "intro": "Tamarix laxa var. subspicata, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces pink to reddish flowers in clustered spikes, which appear in summer. It is adapted to saline and well-drained soils, making it resilient in coastal environments. Its ability to tolerate drought and salt makes it a common species in coastal dunes and salt marshes."
