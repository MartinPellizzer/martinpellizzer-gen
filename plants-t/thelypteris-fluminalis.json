    "intro": "Thelypteris fluminalis, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, and wetlands. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Thelypteris fluminalis plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
