    "intro": "Trisetum williamsii, commonly known as Williams' wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shrubland habitats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the sedge family. Trisetum williamsii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
