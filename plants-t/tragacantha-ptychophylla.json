    "intro": "Tragacantha ptychophylla, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
