It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Trophaeum trilobum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to the food web and maintaining water clarity."
