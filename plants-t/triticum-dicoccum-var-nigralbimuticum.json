It is characterized by its dark, glossy grains and intermediate growth habit between wild and domesticated wheats. The plant typically produces compact spikelets with awns, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving modern wheat varieties."
