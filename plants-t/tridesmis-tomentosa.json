    "intro": "Tridesmis tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Tridesmis tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional medicine."
