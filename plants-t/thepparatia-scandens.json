    "intro": "Thepparatia scandens, commonly known as the climbing thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a schizocarp, splitting into two one-seeded parts when mature. Thepparatia scandens is often found in moist, shaded areas and can be invasive in certain regions."
