    "intro": "Taraxacum fissifolium, commonly known as the fissured dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate, toothed leaves that are often fissured or split. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in dry, disturbed soils across temperate regions. Taraxacum fissifolium is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
