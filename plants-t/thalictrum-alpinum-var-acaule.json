It features a rosette of slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or white, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
