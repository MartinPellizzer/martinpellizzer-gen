    "intro": "Trifolium haynaldii, commonly known as Haynald's clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Trifolium haynaldii is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
