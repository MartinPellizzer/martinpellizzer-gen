    "intro": "Tordylium sulcatum, commonly known as the zigzagged fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Tordyliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib running along the center. Tordylium sulcatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
