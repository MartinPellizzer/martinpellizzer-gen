    "intro": "Trimelopter ovatum, commonly known as the round-leafed trimelopter, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
