    "intro": "Taraxacum delanghii, commonly known as the Delanghii dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, toothed stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of pappus-bearing seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
