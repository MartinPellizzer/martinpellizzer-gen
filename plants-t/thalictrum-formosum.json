    "intro": "Thalictrum formosum, commonly known as the Chinese meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Thalictrum formosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
