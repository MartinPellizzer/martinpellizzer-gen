    "intro": "Trillium kurabayashii, commonly known as Kurabayashii's trillium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Trillium genus, which is characterized by its three-part leaves and three\u82b1\u74e3 flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing showy white or pale pink flowers that are surrounded by three large, waxy bracts. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
