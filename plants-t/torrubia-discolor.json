    "intro": "Torrubia discolor, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Torrubia discolor is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
