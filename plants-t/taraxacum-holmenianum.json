    "intro": "Taraxacum holmenianum, commonly known as Holmen's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, puffy pappus. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
