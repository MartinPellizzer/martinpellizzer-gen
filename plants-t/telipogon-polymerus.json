    "intro": "Telipogon polymerus, commonly known as the slender bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and heathlands. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a short, creeping stem and produces a single spike of tiny, clustered flowers. It is adapted to low-nutrient soils and requires consistent moisture to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
