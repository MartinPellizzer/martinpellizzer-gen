    "intro": "Taraxacum vulgare var. arcticum, commonly known as Arctic dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, parachute-like seed dispersal structure. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, high-altitude environments."
