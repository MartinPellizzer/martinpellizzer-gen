    "intro": "Taraxacum savonicum, commonly known as the Savonian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of Russia and Scandinavia. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a white, spherical seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds. Taraxacum savonicum is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
