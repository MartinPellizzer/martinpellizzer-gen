    "intro": "Trifolium splendens, commonly known as the golden clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trifolium splendens is often found in meadows and grassy areas, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it an important plant for soil enrichment."
