    "intro": "Triticum aestivum f. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Crete, where it has adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. It typically exhibits shorter stature and a more compact growth habit compared to standard wheat varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are adapted for efficient pollination in its native habitat. Its genetic makeup reflects a blend of wild and cultivated wheat traits, making it of interest for agricultural research and biodiversity conservation."
