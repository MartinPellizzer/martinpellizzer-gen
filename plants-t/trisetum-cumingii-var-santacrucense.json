    "intro": "Trisetum cumingii var. santacrucense, commonly known as the Santa Cruz hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
