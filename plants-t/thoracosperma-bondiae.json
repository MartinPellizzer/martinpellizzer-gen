    "intro": "Thoracosperma bondiae, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark timber and can grow up to 50 meters tall with a broad, buttressed trunk. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat and is valued for its durable wood, though it is also threatened by deforestation."
