It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate frond structure with a distinctive, segmented appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in montane forests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
