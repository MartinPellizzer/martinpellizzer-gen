    "intro": "Thesium tauricola, commonly known as the Crimean thesium, is a flowering plant species native to the Crimean Peninsula. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Thesium tauricola is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
