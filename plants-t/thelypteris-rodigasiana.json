    "intro": "Thelypteris rodigasiana, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, including the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
