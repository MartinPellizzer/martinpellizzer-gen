    "intro": "Tillandsia deppeana var. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
