It is characterized by its slender, twisted stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive gum, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from its bark and used in various industrial and medicinal applications. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Tragacantha curvicaulis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments."
