    "intro": "Tennantia, commonly known as the African arrowroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their stout, clustered stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spadix-like structure surrounded by a spathe, typical of many cycads and palms. The fruit is a three-lobed, fibrous capsule that contains several seeds. Tennantia species are often used in traditional medicine and for their ornamental value in tropical gardens."
