    "intro": "Tragacantha filicaulis, commonly known as the slender tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The plant is known for its mucilaginous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum."
