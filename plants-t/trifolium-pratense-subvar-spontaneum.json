    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subvar. spontaneum, commonly known as red clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It is widely used in agriculture as a forage crop and for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Additionally, it has historical uses in traditional medicine and as a source of honey."
