    "intro": "Tropaeolum majus var. schillingii, commonly known as the scarlet runner bean, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers and edible, bean-like pods that turn yellow as they mature. The plant is a trailing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. Its leaves are heart-shaped and slightly hairy, while the flowers are typically borne in clusters. This variety is prized for both its ornamental value and culinary uses, as the young pods can be harvested and cooked like green beans."
