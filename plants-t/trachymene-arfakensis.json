    "intro": "Trachymene arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of West Papua. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to grow in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique appearance and restricted habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and environmental changes."
