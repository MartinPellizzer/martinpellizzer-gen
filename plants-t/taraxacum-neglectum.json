    "intro": "Taraxacum neglectum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Its flowers develop into fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum neglectum is often considered a weed but also has medicinal and culinary uses."
