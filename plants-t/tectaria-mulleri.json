    "intro": "Tectaria mulleri, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
