    "intro": "Trichipteris estelae, commonly known as the Estela's feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid understory of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity and well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing clusters, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Trichipteris estelae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
