    "intro": "Tubocytisus elongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, dark green leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, elongated berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
