    "intro": "Tylecarpus carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy purple or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which help to deter herbivores. Tylecarpus carolinensis is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas."
