    "intro": "Thymus saturejoides var. pseudomastichina, commonly known as the Persian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs, typical of the Thymus genus. The plant produces compact clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
