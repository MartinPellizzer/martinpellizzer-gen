    "intro": "Tytonia natans, commonly known as the wandering lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, slightly wavy edge. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Tytonia natans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds."
