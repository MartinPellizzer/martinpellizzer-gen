It belongs to the Trillium genus, which is characterized by its three-parted leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its unique feature is the greenish color of its seeds, which sets it apart from other trillium species.
