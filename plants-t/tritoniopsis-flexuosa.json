    "intro": "Tritoniopsis flexuosa, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and the presence of rhizoids that anchor it to moist, shaded environments. The plant forms dense mats and has a distinctive spiral arrangement of its leaves, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in humid, temperate regions and is often found on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Tritoniopsis flexuosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
