It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
