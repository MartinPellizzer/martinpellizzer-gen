    "intro": "Triuris macella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Triuris macella is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
