    "intro": "Thelypteris falcatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically located near the base of the pinnae. Thelypteris falcatiloba is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
