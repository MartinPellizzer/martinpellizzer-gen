    "intro": "Thelypteris affinis, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that typically grow in a compact, upright cluster. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to the soil. Thelypteris affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate foliage."
