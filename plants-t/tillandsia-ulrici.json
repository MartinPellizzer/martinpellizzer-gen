    "intro": "Tillandsia ulrici, commonly known as the Ulric's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
