The leaves are narrow and parallel-veined, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce hard, straw-colored grains. Its seeds are small, oval, and have a dark, smooth coat, which contributes to its unique appearance. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and is used mainly in the production of semolina and pasta."
