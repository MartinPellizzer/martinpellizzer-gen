    "intro": "Trifolium rotundatum, commonly known as the roundleaf clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with rounded tips. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Trifolium rotundatum is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
