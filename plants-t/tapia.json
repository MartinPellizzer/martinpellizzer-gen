    "intro": "Tapia, commonly known as *Begonia socotrana*, is a flowering plant native to the Socotra Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its unique, waxy leaves that often display a striking blue or purple hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. Tapia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
