    "intro": "Tomophyllum repandulum, commonly known as the broadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dense, leathery thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically green to yellowish, while the lower surface is pale and covered with fine, branched rhizines. It grows on bark, stone, and soil in temperate regions. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
