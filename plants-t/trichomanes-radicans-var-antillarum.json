    "intro": "Trichomanes radicans var. antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean walking fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, with a dark green coloration on the upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ability to adapt to various soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in tropical ecosystems."
