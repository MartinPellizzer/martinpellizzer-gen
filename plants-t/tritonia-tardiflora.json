    "intro": "Tritonia tardiflora, commonly known as the late-flowering tritonia, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant produces long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Tritonia tardiflora prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and long blooming period make it a valuable addition to botanical collections."
