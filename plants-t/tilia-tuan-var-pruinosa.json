    "intro": "Tilia tuan var. pruinosa, commonly known as the Prunose Tilia, is a variant of the Tilia genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive grayish-white, waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer. The bark is smooth and light brown, often peeling in thin layers."
