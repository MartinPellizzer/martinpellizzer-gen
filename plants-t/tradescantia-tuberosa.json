    "intro": "Tradescantia tuberosa, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tuberous roots and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground covers."
