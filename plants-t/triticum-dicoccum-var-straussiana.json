    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. straussiana, commonly known as hulless barley, is a variety of barley characterized by its lack of a hull, which makes it easier to process. It is a hexaploid species native to the Fertile Crescent and has been cultivated for thousands of years. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous two-rowed spikelets. Its grains are rich in proteins, fiber, and minerals, making it a valuable crop for both human consumption and animal feed. It is also used in the production of traditional foods and beverages."
