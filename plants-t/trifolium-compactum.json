    "intro": "Trifolium compactum, commonly known as the dwarf clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Trifolium compactum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
