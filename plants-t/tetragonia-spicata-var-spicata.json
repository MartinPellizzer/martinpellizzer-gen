    "intro": "Tetragonia spicata var. spicata, commonly known as sea beet, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, and its stems are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Americas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for growth in arid and coastal habitats."
