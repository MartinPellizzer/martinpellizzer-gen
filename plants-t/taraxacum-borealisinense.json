    "intro": "Taraxacum borealisinense, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of northern Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
