    "intro": "Thymus przewalskii var. magnus, commonly known as the giant thyme, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in both traditional medicine and culinary applications. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
