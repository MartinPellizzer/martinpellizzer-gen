    "intro": "Taraxacum lateritium, commonly known as the laterite dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Taraxacum lateritium is a hardy species that can thrive in poor soil conditions and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
