    "intro": "Thesium caespitans, commonly known as the sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It forms dense, low-growing mats of foliage, with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. Thesium caespitans plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
