    "intro": "Tropidia, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions and are characterized by their striking, often fragrant flowers. Tropidia species typically have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding their survival in variable environmental conditions. Their roots are often aerial, allowing them to grow on trees or other structures in their natural habitat. The flowers of tropidia come in a wide range of colors, making them popular in horticulture and botanical gardens."
