    "intro": "Tragacantha mercklinii, commonly known as the desert gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a distinctive resinous coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Tragacantha mercklinii is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a deep root system to access groundwater."
