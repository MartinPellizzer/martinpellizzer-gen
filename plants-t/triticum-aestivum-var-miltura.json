    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. miltura, commonly known as the millet wheat, is a variant of wheat that is less commonly cultivated than other wheat species. It is characterized by its smaller grains and shorter stature compared to common wheat. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited water resources. The plant produces compact spikes with small, hard grains that are typically used for animal feed or traditional foods in certain cultures. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short growth cycle, which contribute to its resilience in challenging climates."
