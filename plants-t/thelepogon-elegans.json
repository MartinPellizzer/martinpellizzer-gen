    "intro": "Thelepogon elegans, commonly known as the slender tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Thelepogon elegans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
