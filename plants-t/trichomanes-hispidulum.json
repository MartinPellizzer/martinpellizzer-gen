    "intro": "Trichomanes hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes hispidulum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
