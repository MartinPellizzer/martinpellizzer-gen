    "intro": "Tium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's tium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tium wilsonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
