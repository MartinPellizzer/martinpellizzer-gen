    "intro": "Trichocaulon kubusense, commonly known as the Kubu mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered with fine, hair-like structures, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichocaulon kubusense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
