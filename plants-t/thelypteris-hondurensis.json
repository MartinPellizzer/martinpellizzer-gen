    "intro": "Thelypteris hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, scaly hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris hondurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
