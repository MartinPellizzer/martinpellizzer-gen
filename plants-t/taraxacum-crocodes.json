    "intro": "Taraxacum crocodes, commonly known as the crocodile dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, hairy stem that resembles the scales of a crocodile. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelion species, contributing to its widespread distribution."
