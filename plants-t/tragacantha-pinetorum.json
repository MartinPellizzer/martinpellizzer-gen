    "intro": "Tragacantha pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which can be harvested and used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tragacantha pinetorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
