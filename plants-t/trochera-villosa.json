    "intro": "Trochera villosa, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and can be found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating on the roots of host plants, where it establishes a connection for nutrient uptake. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
