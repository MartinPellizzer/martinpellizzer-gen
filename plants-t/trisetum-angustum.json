    "intro": "Trisetum angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a bottlebrush. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spikelet-based flowers. Trisetum angustum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
