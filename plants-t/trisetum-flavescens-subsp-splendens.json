    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens subsp. splendens, commonly known as the golden false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow-green foliage that turns reddish in the fall. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, open woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
