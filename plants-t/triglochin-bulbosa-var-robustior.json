    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa var. robustior, commonly known as the robust marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features succulent, often reddish stems and leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
