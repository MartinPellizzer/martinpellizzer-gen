    "intro": "Trillium \u00d7 yezoense var. atropurpureocarpum, commonly known as the purple-fruited trillium, is a hybrid species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive three-part leaves and showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark purple, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is often found in the understory of temperate forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
