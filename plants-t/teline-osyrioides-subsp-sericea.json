    "intro": "Teline osyrioides subsp. sericea, commonly known as silky teline, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
