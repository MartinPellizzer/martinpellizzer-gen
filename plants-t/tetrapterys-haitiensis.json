    "intro": "Tetrapterys haitiensis, commonly known as Haitian shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Tetrapterys haitiensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
