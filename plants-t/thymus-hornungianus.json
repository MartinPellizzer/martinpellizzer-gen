    "intro": "Thymus hornungianus, commonly known as Hornung's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it medicinal and culinary uses."
