    "intro": "Tillandsia subulifera, commonly known as the needle-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. This species is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
