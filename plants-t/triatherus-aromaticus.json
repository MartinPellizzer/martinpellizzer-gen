    "intro": "Triatherus aromaticus, commonly known as the fragrant spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its aromatic properties are attributed to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. Triatherus aromaticus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
