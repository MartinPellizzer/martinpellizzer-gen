    "intro": "Torrubia obtusata var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited torrubia, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
