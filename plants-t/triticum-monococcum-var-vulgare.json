    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. vulgare, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 13.5 gigabases, making it one of the smallest wheat genomes. The plant produces compact spikes with small, awned glumes that enclose the florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the seeds are typically pale yellow to reddish in color. Einkorn wheat is characterized by its high protein content and unique nutritional profile, including a high concentration of minerals and antioxidants."
