    "intro": "Trifolium glabellum, commonly known as the smooth clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a common stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium glabellum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
