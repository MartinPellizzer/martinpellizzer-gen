    "intro": "Taraxacum porphyranthum, commonly known as the purple dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to East Asia, it thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant's latex is milky and contains compounds that may have medicinal properties. Its life cycle includes a dormant phase during winter, with new growth emerging in spring."
