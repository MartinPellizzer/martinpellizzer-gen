    "intro": "Touterea humilis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen shrub that features striking, silver-white leaves with a velvety texture. The plant's foliage is composed of multiple overlapping leaflets that form a rosette shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The silver fern is also notable for its ability to produce a small, inconspicuous flower followed by a red, fleshy fruit."
