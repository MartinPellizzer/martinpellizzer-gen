    "intro": "Tricalysia mortehanii, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Tricalysia mortehanii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a range of soil types."
