    "intro": "Thelypteris philippina, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across wetland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris philippina plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
