    "intro": "Typha latifolia subsp. shuttleworthii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a variant of the common cattail found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical subspecies. The plant produces cylindrical flower spikes, with the lower portion being male and the upper portion female, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
