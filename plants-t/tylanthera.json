    "intro": "Tylanthera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that often appear to be translucent or ghostly in appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Tylanthera species typically have heart-shaped leaves and produce small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive botanical specimen."
