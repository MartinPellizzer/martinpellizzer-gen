    "intro": "Trisetobromus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Trisetobromus hirtus has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
