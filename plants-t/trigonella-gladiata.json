    "intro": "Trigonella gladiata, commonly known as the sword bean, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive triangular leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Trigonella gladiata is often grown as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It is also valued for its edible seeds, which can be used in various culinary applications."
