    "intro": "Torrubia snethlagei, commonly known as the narrow-leafed torrubia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
