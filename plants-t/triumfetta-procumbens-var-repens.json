    "intro": "Triumfetta procumbens var. repens, commonly known as creeping triumfetta, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open woodlands."
