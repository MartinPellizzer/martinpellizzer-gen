    "intro": "Tillandsia blokii, commonly known as the Blok's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, instead anchoring itself to trees or other surfaces. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia blokii is popular among plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
