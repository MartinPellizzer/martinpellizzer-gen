    "intro": "Thuja tatarica, commonly known as the Tatarian arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Siberia. It features scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in flat sprays, giving it a dense, pyramidal shape. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Thuja tatarica is also valued for its resistance to pests and diseases, contributing to its widespread use in horticulture."
