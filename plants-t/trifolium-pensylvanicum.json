    "intro": "Trifolium pensylvanicum, commonly known as Pennsylvania clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Pennsylvania clover plays a vital role in soil nitrogen fixation, making it an important plant for ecological restoration."
