    "intro": "Teucrium stoloniferum, commonly known as creeping germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, prostrate stems that form a dense mat. The plant features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with slightly hairy surfaces. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often used in herbal medicine and as a ground cover in gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
