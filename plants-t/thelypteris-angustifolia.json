    "intro": "Thelypteris angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Thelypteris angustifolia reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fertile fronds."
