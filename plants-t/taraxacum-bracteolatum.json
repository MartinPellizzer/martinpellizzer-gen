It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, showy composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
