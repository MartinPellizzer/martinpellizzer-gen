    "intro": "Tapeinosperma pulchellum, commonly known as the pretty sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and has small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
