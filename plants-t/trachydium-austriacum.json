    "intro": "Trachydium austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian trachydium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Trachydium austriacum is native to Europe and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
