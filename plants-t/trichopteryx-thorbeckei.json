    "intro": "Trichopteryx thorbeckei, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces violet-colored berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Trichopteryx thorbeckei thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky outcrops and in open woodlands. Its unique flowering pattern and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
