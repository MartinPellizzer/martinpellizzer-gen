It features delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble plumes, composed of numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
