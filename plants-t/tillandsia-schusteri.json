    "intro": "Tillandsia schusteri, commonly known as the Schuster's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
