    "intro": "Trichosanthes villosula, commonly known as the hairy gourd, is a flowering plant native to southern Asia. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant features large, lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into long, cylindrical fruits covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes fibrous and bitter when fully mature. It is often cultivated for its edible young fruit and is used in traditional cuisines across its native regions."
