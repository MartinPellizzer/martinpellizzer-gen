It is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
