    "intro": "Thelypteris fasciola, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically slender and arching. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris fasciola is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors."
