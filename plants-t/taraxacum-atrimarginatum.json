    "intro": "Taraxacum atrimarginatum, commonly known as the purple margined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive purple-tinged leaf margins. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are alternate, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive lobed shape. It produces a capsule fruit that releases tiny seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal."
