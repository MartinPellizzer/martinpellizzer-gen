    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-ticks, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other subspecies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its attractive foliage and early blooming habit, it is often cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
