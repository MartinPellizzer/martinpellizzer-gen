    "intro": "Thalictrum laxum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are arranged in loose, racemose inflorescences. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Thalictrum laxum is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and forest edges, where it contributes to biodiversity and ecological stability."
