    "intro": "Trollius pumilus var. tehkehensis, commonly known as the Tehkehenskaya globeflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
