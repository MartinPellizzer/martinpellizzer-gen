    "intro": "Trigonella phrygia, commonly known as Persian clover, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. It features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Its seeds are small and hardy, often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Trigonella phrygia is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
