    "intro": "Thelypteris chrysoloba, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
