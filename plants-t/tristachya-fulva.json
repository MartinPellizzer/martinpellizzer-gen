    "intro": "Tristachya fulva, commonly known as the golden panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow inflorescence that resembles a tassel, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Tristachya fulva is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
