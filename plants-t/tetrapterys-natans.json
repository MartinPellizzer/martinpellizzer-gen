    "intro": "Tetrapterys natans, commonly known as water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its floating, delicate fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged surfaces, and its leaves are typically divided into multiple segments. Tetrapterys natans is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is often used in ornamental water gardens. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
