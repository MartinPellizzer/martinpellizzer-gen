    "intro": "Thelypteris dutrae, commonly known as the Dutra's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lanceolate segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris dutrae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
