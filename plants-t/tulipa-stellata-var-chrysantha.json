    "intro": "Tulipa stellata var. chrysantha, commonly known as the golden star tulip, is a striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This variety is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that radiate outward from a central yellow bloom, creating a star-like appearance. It produces upright, strap-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant is relatively cold-hardy and can be grown in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7. Its showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders in spring."
