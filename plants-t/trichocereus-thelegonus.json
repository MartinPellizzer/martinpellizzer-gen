    "intro": "Trichocereus thelegonus, commonly known as the \"Giant Cactus of the Andes,\" is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. Trichocereus thelegonus is also noted for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in arid, rocky environments."
