    "intro": "Trichomanes digitatum var. corticola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a specialized variant of the genus Trichomanes, belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Its fronds are usually clustered in a rosette-like formation, and it produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. This variant is notable for its ability to adapt to nutrient-poor substrates, making it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native range."
