    "intro": "Tococa occidentalis, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are used to make chocolate, similar to cacao. It thrives in warm, humid climates with high rainfall and is often found in lowland areas. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it plays a significant role in both local biodiversity and global chocolate production."
