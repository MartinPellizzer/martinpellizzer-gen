    "intro": "Triphysaria, commonly known as the \"butterfly pea\" or \"trifoliate morning glory,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Convolvulaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its trumpet-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are known for their rapid growth and climbing habit. Triphysaria species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
