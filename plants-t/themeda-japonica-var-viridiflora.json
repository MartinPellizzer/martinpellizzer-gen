    "intro": "Themeda japonica var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered tussock grass, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It features slender, erect stems that form dense tussocks, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear greenish flowers, which are unique among grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
