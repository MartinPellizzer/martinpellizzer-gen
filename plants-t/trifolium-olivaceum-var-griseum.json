    "intro": "Trifolium olivaceum var. griseum, commonly known as the pale trefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
