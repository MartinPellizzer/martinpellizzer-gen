    "intro": "Tilia paucicostata var. ningshanensis, commonly known as the Ningshan hornbeam, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
