    "intro": "Thecacoris membranacea, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. Native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia, it thrives in nutrient-poor environments. The plant's leaves are typically small and succulent, adapted for water retention. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it an intriguing subject in the study of carnivorous plants."
