    "intro": "Taraxacum rubrisquameum, commonly known as the red-squamated dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that produce lightweight seeds dispersed by the wind. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered with fine, white hairs. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is noted for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
