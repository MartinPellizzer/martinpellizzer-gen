    "intro": "Tragacantha glabra, commonly known as the white tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a viscous, gelatinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tragacantha glabra thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
