    "intro": "Tripterospermum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved tripterospermum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
