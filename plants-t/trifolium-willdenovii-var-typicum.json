It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides.
