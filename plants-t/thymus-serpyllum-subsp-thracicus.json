It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable for both culinary and medicinal uses."
