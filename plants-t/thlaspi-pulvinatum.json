    "intro": "Thlaspi pulvinatum, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has dark green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds when mature. Thlaspi pulvinatum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
