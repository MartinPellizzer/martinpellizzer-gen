    "intro": "Tectaria jacobsii, commonly known as the Jacob's tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature among ferns."
