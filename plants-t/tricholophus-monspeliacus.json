It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Tricholophus monspeliacus is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
