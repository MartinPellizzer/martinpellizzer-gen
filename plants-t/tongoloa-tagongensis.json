    "intro": "Tongoloa tagongensis, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and elongated, slender leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Tongoloa tagongensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
