    "intro": "Triaspis niedenzuiana, commonly known as the Zambian starfish, is a rare and striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
