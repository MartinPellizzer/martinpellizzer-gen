    "intro": "Tapinanthus woodfordioides, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's stems are often covered in fine, thread-like structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host. It is native to parts of Africa and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
