    "intro": "Trigonochilum gramazuense, commonly known as the Gramazu's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring three sepals and three petals that form a distinctive trigonal shape. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with a complex arrangement of stamens and a specialized labellum that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum gramazuense is considered a species of conservation concern."
