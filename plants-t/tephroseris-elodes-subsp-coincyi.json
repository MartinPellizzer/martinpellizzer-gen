    "intro": "Tephroseris elodes subsp. coincyi, commonly known as the slender tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The subspecies is typically found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and early summer, and it plays a role in pollination by attracting various insects. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
