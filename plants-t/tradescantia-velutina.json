    "intro": "Tradescantia velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, low-maintenance foliage."
