    "intro": "Taraxacum texelense, commonly known as the Texel dandelion, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Texel in the Netherlands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white pappus-covered seed head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
