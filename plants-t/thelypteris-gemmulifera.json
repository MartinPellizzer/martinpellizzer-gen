It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, round structures called gemmae, which are used for vegetative reproduction. Thelypteris gemmulifera typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
