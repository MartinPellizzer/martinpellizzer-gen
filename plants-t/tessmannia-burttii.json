    "intro": "Tessmannia burttii, commonly known as the Tasmanian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to Tasmania. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and gelatinous berries. The plant attaches to its host tree, primarily eucalypts, through a specialized root system called a haustellum, which extracts water and nutrients. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
