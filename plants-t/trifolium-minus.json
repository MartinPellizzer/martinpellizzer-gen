    "intro": "Trifolium minus, commonly known as lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium minus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
