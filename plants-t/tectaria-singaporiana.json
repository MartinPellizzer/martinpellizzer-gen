    "intro": "Tectaria singaporiana, commonly known as the Singapore shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective operculum."
