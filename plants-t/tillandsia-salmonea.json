    "intro": "Tillandsia salmonea, commonly known as the salmon tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically pink or red, and it produces small, showy inflorescences. Tillandsia salmonea is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
