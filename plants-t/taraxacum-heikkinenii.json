    "intro": "Taraxacum heikkinenii, commonly known as the Heikkinen's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion genus native to Finland. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forest edges or open meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
