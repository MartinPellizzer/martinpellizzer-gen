    "intro": "Trifolium cousturieri, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
