    "intro": "Thelypteris camarinensis, commonly known as the Camar\u00edn shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris camarinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
