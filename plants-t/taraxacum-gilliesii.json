    "intro": "Taraxacum gilliesii, commonly known as the Gillies\u2019 dandelion, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Taraxacum gilliesii is an important component of New Zealand\u2019s native flora and is adapted to the country's unique environmental conditions."
