    "intro": "Tenrhynea phylicifolia, commonly known as the licorice fern, is a rare and unique plant found in specific tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble the leaves of licorice plants. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a complex, lace-like structure, which aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
