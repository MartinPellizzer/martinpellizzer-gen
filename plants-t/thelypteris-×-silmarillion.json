    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 silmarillion, commonly known as the Starlight Fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris californica and Thelypteris acutifrons. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that exhibit a striking bi-color pattern, often with a pale green to silver underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded rockeries. Its foliage is known for its ethereal appearance, which has inspired its whimsical common name. Thelypteris \u00d7 silmarillion is relatively low-maintenance, requiring well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
