    "intro": "Tilia americana subf. euryptera, commonly known as the American linden or large-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of the common linden. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators like bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
