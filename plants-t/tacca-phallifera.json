    "intro": "Tacca phallifera, commonly known as the \"toad lily,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, violet-hued bracts that resemble the shape of a toad, hence its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, clustered in a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid, tropical environment. Tacca phallifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
