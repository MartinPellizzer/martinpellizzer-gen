It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name."
