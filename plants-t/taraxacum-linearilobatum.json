    "intro": "Taraxacum linearilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports the yellow flower head, which later develops into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is noted for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
