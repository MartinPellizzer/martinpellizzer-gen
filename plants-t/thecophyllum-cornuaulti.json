    "intro": "Thecophyllum cornuaulti, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are adorned with small, horn-like protrusions along the edges. Native to tropical regions of Africa, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, well-drained soil. Thecophyllum cornuaulti is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a controlled indoor environment."
