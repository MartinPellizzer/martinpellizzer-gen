    "intro": "Thermopsis gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to high-altitude conditions with its compact growth habit. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of small, feathery leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
