    "intro": "Trifolium dichroanthum, commonly known as the two-colored clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically have two distinct leaflets of different colors. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium dichroanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
