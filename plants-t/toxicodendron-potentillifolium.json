    "intro": "Toxicodendron potentillifolium, commonly known as the western poison oak, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is known for causing skin irritation upon contact due to the presence of urushiol, a potent allergen. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, chaparral, and disturbed soils."
