    "intro": "Trifolium bocconei, commonly known as the Boccone's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, where it grows in rocky and open habitats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub environments. Trifolium bocconei plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
