    "intro": "Trifolium petrisavii, commonly known as the Petrisavi's clover, is a rare and lesser-known species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in grassy habitats and along woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
