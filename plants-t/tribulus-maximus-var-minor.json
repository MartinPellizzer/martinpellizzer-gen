    "intro": "Tribulus maximus var. minor, commonly known as lesser caltrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with a sprawling habit, featuring hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive four-angled fruits that contain four sharp, spiny seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and it thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments. Due to its spiny fruits, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
