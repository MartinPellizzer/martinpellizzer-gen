    "intro": "Taraxacum pollichii, commonly known as the Pollich's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head composed of many small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a feathery pappus that allows for wind pollination and seed distribution. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
