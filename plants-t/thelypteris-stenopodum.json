    "intro": "Thelypteris stenopodum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris stenopodum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat."
