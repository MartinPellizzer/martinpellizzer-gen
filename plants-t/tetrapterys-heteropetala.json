    "intro": "Tetrapterys heteropetala, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tetrapterys heteropetala is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
