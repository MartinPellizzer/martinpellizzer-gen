It is a low-growing annual herb with smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are usually entire or slightly lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, followed by rounded, cup-shaped seed pods. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
