    "intro": "Thymus stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils, including thymol and carvacrol. Thymus stenophyllus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
