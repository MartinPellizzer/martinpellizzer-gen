    "intro": "Trifolium thionanthum, commonly known as the sulfur-yellow clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, sandy soils. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Trifolium thionanthum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
