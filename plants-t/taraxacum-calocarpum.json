    "intro": "Taraxacum calocarpum, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a tall, hollow stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower develops into a spherical, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. This species is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in supporting pollinators."
