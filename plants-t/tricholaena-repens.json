    "intro": "Tricholaena repens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to climb or trail along the ground. It features compound leaves with elongated, narrow leaflets that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or brown in color, followed by spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Tricholaena repens is an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems."
