    "intro": "Topobea elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to its native habitat and suitable for xeriscaping in similar climates."
