    "intro": "Tilia intermedia, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are smaller and more rounded than those of the common linden (Tilia europaea). The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia intermedia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in parks and gardens for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
