    "intro": "Tillandsia vittata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and photosynthesis. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, colorful flowers that attract pollinators."
