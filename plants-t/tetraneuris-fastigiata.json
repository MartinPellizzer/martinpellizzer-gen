    "intro": "Tetraneuris fastigiata, commonly known as the silverleaf tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact, upright growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to the landscape. Tetraneuris fastigiata is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
