    "intro": "Tetragonolobus maritimus subsp. siliquosus, commonly known as the coastal sida, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by slender, cylindrical pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments, making it a common sight along shorelines. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
