    "intro": "Trifolium filiforme subsp. minus, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
