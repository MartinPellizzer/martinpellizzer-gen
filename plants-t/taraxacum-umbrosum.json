    "intro": "Taraxacum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its flower and is surrounded by bracts. The seeds are dispersed by wind, with each seed having a parachute-like structure called a pappus."
