    "intro": "Trigonella corniculata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fenugreek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in umbels, followed by small, kidney-shaped pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the standard Trigonella corniculata but is valued for its potential medicinal properties."
