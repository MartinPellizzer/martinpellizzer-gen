    "intro": "Taraxacum tetricum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the distinctive seed heads that release lightweight seeds on the wind. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum tetricum is often considered a weed but plays an important role in pollination and soil stabilization."
