    "intro": "Tricalysia ambrensis subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the rough tricalysia, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaf arrangement. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving the plant its subspecies name, *coriacea*, meaning \"rough\" in Latin. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
