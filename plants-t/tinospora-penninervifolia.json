It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive venation pattern, often featuring three to five pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tinospora penninervifolia is often found growing along forest edges, in moist and semi-shaded environments."
