    "intro": "Trivalvaria longirostris, commonly known as the long-snouted water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a complex root system that anchors it in shallow water and absorbs nutrients from the substrate. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Trivalvaria longirostris plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
