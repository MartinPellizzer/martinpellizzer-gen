    "intro": "Triticum pyramidale var. pseudoreichenbachii, commonly known as the Tibetan wild wheat, is a rare and ancient grass species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is considered a valuable genetic resource for wheat breeding due to its potential for improving drought tolerance and disease resistance. However, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and climate change."
