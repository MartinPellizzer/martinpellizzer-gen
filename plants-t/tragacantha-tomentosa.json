    "intro": "Tragacantha tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
