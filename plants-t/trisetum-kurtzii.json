    "intro": "Trisetum kurtzii, commonly known as the Kurtz's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trisetum kurtzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
