    "intro": "Trilepis oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's trilepis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
