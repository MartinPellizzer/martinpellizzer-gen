    "intro": "Trimetra ficoidea, commonly known as the fig-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the common fig. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are typically green when mature. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with tendrils for support, and its leaves are often used in traditional medicine. The plant's growth habit and foliage make it a popular ornamental species in warm climates."
