    "intro": "Terminalia exsculpta, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by hard, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Terminalia exsculpta is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
