    "intro": "Tephrocactus tarapacanus, commonly known as the Puya or Andean Puya, is a unique cactus species native to the Atacama Desert in Chile. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stem and large, showy inflorescences that resemble those of the orchid family. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that can range from red to purple, which are not flowers but modified leaves. It is adapted to the extreme arid conditions of its habitat, storing water in its thick, segmented stem. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid gardens and botanical collections."
