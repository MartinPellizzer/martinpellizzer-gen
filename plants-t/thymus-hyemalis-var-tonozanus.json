    "intro": "Thymus hyemalis var. tonozanus, commonly known as the winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or lavender flowers during late winter to early spring, making it a valuable early bloomer in gardens. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its aromatic properties and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
