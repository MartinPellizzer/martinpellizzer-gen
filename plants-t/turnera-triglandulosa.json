    "intro": "Turnera triglandulosa, commonly known as Mexican flame bean, is a shrub native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate, and its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain edible seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
