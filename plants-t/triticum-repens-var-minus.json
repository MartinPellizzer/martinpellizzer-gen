    "intro": "Triticum repens var. minus, commonly known as the lesser quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
