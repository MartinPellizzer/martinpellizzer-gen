    "intro": "Tanacetum dumosum, commonly known as the woolly tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and aromatic, yellowish-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tanacetum dumosum contains essential oils with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally considered toxic in large quantities. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas."
