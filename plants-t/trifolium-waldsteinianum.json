    "intro": "Trifolium waldsteinianum, commonly known as Waldstein's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Native to central and eastern Europe, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Waldstein's clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
