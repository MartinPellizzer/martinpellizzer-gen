    "intro": "Tragacantha cruentiflora, commonly known as the crimson-flowered tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a thick, gum-like substance from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, often with a slightly fuzzy texture. Tragacantha cruentiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
