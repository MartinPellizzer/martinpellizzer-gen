    "intro": "Thuja tetragona, commonly known as the Japanese thuja, is a coniferous evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Thuja tetragona is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its use in traditional Japanese gardens."
