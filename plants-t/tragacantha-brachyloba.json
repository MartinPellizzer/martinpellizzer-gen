    "intro": "Tragacantha brachyloba, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing small, dark seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems and having deep root systems. The plant is valued for its gum, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and industrial applications."
