    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Thalictrum flavum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
