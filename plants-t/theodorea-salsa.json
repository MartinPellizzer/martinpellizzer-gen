    "intro": "Theodorea salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. Theodorea salsa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
