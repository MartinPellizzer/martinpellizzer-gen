    "intro": "Trigonella corniculata subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater trigonella, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. This subspecies is of interest in botany due to its morphological distinctions from other Trigonella species."
