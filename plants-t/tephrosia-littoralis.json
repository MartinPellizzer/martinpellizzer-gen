    "intro": "Tephrosia littoralis, commonly known as coastal tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions, particularly found in coastal areas of Africa and the Caribbean. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near the shoreline, adapting to salty and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with three leaflets that are opposite in arrangement. Tephrosia littoralis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and use in traditional herbal remedies."
