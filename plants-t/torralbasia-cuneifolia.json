    "intro": "Torralbasia cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf torralbasia, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
