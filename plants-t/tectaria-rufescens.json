    "intro": "Tectaria rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that often have a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps it retain water in its humid environment. Tectaria rufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
