    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used historically in agriculture and traditional medicine."
