    "intro": "Talisia carinata, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or carinata tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing edible seeds. Talisia carinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential economic importance due to its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in forested areas."
