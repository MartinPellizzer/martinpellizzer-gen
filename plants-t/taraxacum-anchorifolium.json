    "intro": "Taraxacum anchorifolium, commonly known as the anchorleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble an anchor, giving it its common name. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, hairless stem with a crown of bracts. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and wet meadows. Taraxacum anchorifolium is typically short-lived, with a lifespan of one to two years."
