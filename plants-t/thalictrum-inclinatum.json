    "intro": "Thalictrum inclinatum, commonly known as the leaning avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, often drooping stems. Thalictrum inclinatum prefers moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens with suitable conditions."
