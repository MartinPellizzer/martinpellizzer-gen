    "intro": "Taraxacum towadense, commonly known as the Towada dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
