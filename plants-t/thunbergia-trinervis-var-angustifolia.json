It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with three prominent veins. The plant produces trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The variety angustifolia is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Thunbergia trinervis."
