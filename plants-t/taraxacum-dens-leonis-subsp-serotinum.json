    "intro": "Taraxacum dens-leonis subsp. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, composite flower head. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a \"puffball,\" which is a key feature in its reproductive strategy. Its leaves are typically more densely hairy than those of other dandelion species, and the flower head blooms later in the season compared to other Taraxacum species. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
