    "intro": "Thelypteris gueintziana, commonly known as the Gueintziana holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, often serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Thelypteris gueintziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
