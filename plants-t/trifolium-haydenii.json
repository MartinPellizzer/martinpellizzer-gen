    "intro": "Trifolium haydenii, commonly known as Hayden's clover, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Trifolium haydenii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
