    "intro": "Trollius ranunculoides, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, making it both a garden favorite and an invasive species in some regions. Trollius ranunculoides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
