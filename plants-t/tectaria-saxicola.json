    "intro": "Tectaria saxicola, commonly known as the rock tectaria, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself securely in its habitat. Tectaria saxicola is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
