It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with rough textures and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become an invasive species in some areas."
