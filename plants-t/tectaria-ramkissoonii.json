It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps it adhere to its substrate. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
