    "intro": "Tephrocactus ignescens, commonly known as the fire cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features a short, thick stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters during the warmer months. Tephrocactus ignescens is well adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its succulent stem and exhibiting a unique ability to withstand high temperatures."
