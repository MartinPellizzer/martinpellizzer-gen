    "intro": "Trichomanes cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Trichomanes cultratum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
