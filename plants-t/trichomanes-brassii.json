    "intro": "Trichomanes brassii, commonly known as the golden hartscale, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Trichomanes brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
