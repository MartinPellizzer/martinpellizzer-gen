    "intro": "Trichocephalus atratus, commonly known as the black-headed spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black sepals and petals, which contrast with its white or pale yellow labellum. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. Trichocephalus atratus is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological complexity."
