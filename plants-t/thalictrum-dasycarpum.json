    "intro": "Thalictrum dasycarpum, commonly known as the woolly false Solomon's seal, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled leaves with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on long pedicels. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, a characteristic common in the Ranunculaceae family. Thalictrum dasycarpum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
