    "intro": "Thalictrum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Thalictrum cuneatum is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks."
