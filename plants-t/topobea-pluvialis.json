    "intro": "Topobea pluvialis, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the winter months. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and preventing erosion. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
