    "intro": "Terminalis oxyphylla, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in a fine pubescence. Terminalis oxyphylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
