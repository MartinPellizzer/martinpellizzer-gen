    "intro": "Trapa chinensis var. flerovii, commonly known as the Chinese water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The seeds, which are edible, are encased in a hard, spiny shell and are often harvested for culinary use."
