It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically red when mature. Tarenna yappii is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
