It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
