    "intro": "Taraxacum patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and forest clearings. Taraxacum patulum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
