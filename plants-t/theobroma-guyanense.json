    "intro": "Theobroma guyanense, commonly known as the Guyana chocolate tree, is a species of the Sterculiaceae family native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval-shaped pods containing its edible seeds. These seeds, often referred to as cacao beans, are the primary source of cocoa used in chocolate production. Theobroma guyanense is valued not only for its economic importance but also for its ecological role in tropical forests."
