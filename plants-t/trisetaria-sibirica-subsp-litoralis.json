    "intro": "Trisetaria sibirica subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It thrives in sandy and saline environments, often found along shores and dunes where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the integrity of coastal ecosystems."
