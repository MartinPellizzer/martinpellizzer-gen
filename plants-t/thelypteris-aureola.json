    "intro": "Thelypteris aureola, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Thelypteris aureola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
