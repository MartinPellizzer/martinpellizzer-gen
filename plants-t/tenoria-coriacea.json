    "intro": "Tenoria coriacea, commonly known as the rough tenoria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of thick, leathery, and hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Tenoria coriacea is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
