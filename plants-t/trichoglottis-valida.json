    "intro": "Trichoglottis valida, commonly known as the valid trichoglottis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elliptical and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture. Trichoglottis valida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
