    "intro": "Taraxacum pandum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Taraxacum pandum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high altitudes."
