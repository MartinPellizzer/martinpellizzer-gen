    "intro": "Tomophyllum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf star-of-Bethlehem, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact growth habit with thin, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
