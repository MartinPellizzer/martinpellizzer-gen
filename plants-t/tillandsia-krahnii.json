    "intro": "Tillandsia krahnii, commonly known as the Krahn's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia krahnii is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
