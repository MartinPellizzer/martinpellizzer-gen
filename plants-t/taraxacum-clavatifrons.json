    "intro": "Taraxacum clavatifrons, commonly known as the club-fronded dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces a single, elongated, yellow flower head that blooms in early spring, followed by a crown of white, feathery seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other dandelion species."
