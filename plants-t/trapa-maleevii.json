    "intro": "Trapa maleevii, commonly known as the maleevii water chestnut, is a rare aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Euryalaceae and is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense vegetation that provides habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early summer, while its fruit develops into a woody, helmet-shaped structure. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Trapa maleevii is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
