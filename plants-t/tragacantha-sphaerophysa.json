    "intro": "Tragacantha sphaerophysa, commonly known as the globe thornapple, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its fruit is a rounded, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds. While it is often cultivated as an ornamental, it can become invasive in certain environments."
