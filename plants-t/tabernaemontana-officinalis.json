It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, humid environment to flourish. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich nature."
