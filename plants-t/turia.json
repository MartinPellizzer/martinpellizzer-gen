    "intro": "Turia, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a deciduous tree native to Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by edible, black berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in urban landscapes due to its adaptability. Turia has been cultivated for centuries for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
