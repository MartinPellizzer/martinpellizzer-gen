    "intro": "Trapa media, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The seeds of Trapa media are often dispersed by water currents and can remain viable for several years."
