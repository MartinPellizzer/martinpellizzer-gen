    "intro": "Torreya grandis var. merrillii, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare and endangered evergreen conifer native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
