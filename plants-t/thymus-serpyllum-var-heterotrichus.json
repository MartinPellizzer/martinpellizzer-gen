    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. heterotrichus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, small, grey-green leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
