    "intro": "Themeda gigantea, commonly known as the giant grass or large kangaroo grass, is a tall, perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its robust, erect stems that can grow up to 2-3 meters in height. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Themeda gigantea is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological structure of native grasslands."
