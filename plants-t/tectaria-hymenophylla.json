    "intro": "Tectaria hymenophylla, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and indirect light. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through asexual and sexual means. Tectaria hymenophylla is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its elegant appearance and unique texture."
