    "intro": "Taeniophyllum smithii, commonly known as the Smith's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are often pale green or white, resembling the color of the surrounding foliage. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a single, narrow leaf. It is an epiphytic species, growing on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
