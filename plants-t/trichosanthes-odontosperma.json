It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its distinctive, bitter, and ridged fruit. The plant produces yellow flowers and has tendrils that help it climb. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The fruit is typically harvested when it is still green, though it can also be used when fully mature and orange in color."
