    "intro": "Trichodesma indicum var. amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping trichodesma, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often clasp the stem, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in terminal spikes, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its leaves are typically pubescent, and the plant has a woody stem with a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
