    "intro": "Temminckia chamissoniana, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils near the coast. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
