    "intro": "Trisetaria distichophylla subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
