    "intro": "Triplosperma, commonly known as the moon vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or climbing plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Triplosperma species produce\u84c7\u8456 (capsular) fruits that contain seeds with tufted arils, which aid in seed dispersal. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and have traditional uses in some cultures."
