    "intro": "Turnera rupestris var. frutescens, commonly known as the rock turnera, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent, showy bracts, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
