It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from purple to violet, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it both a useful culinary herb and a valuable addition to ornamental landscapes."
