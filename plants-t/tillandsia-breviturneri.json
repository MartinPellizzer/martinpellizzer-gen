    "intro": "Tillandsia breviturneri, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a short, compact stem with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique growth habit and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
