It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, tall, yellow flowering stem that produces a crown of ray florets. Native to central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
