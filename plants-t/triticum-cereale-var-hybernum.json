    "intro": "Triticum cereale var. hybernum, commonly known as the hexaploid wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its hexaploid genome, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. This variety is notable for its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Botanically, it features spikelets that are typically arranged in a compact, cylindrical inflorescence, with lemmas and paleas that protect the florets. The grains are usually hard and have a high protein content, making them valuable for bread-making. Its morphology and genetic makeup make it an important species in both agricultural and botanical studies."
