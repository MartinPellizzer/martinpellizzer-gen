It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, typical of the genus Thrixspermum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
