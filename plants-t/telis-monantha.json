    "intro": "Telis monantha, commonly known as the white-flowered telis, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is a shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Telis monantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
