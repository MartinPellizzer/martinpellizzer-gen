    "intro": "Torenia veronicifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to violet. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a trait that gives it its common name. Torenia veronicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
