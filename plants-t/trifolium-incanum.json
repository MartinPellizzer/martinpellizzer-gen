    "intro": "Trifolium incanum, commonly known as the silver vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Trifolium incanum is a hardy species that is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for beneficial insects."
