    "intro": "Thea pleurocarpa, commonly known as the pleurocarp fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the presence of two types of sporangia\u2014pleurocarpous and eusporangiate\u2014on its fronds. The fronds are typically pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, and they are often bioluminescent under certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
