    "intro": "Thymus subarcticus, commonly known as Arctic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, forming a mat-like structure to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in the summer, which are clustered in small groups. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Thymus subarcticus is often used in traditional herbal medicine and is valued for its aromatic properties."
