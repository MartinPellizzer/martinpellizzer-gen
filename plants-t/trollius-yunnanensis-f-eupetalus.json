    "intro": "Trollius yunnanensis f. eupetalus, commonly known as the Yunnan globeflower, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with a prominent central cone, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. The plant is native to the high altitudes of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh mountain conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
