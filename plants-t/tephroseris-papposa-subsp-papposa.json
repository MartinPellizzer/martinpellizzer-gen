    "intro": "Tephroseris papposa subsp. papposa, commonly known as the hairy tephroseris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which aid in reducing water loss in arid environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
