    "intro": "Taxanthema incanum, commonly known as the white sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of whitish powder, which helps reduce water loss. Taxanthema incanum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert ecosystems."
