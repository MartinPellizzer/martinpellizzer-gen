    "intro": "Tetrastigma, commonly known as the cross-leaf vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Vitaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that aid in its growth along supports. The leaves are typically lobed or deeply divided, with a distinctive cross-shaped pattern on the underside, giving it its common name. Tetrastigma species are native to Asia, particularly China, and are often found in forested areas. These plants produce small, greenish-white flowers and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value."
