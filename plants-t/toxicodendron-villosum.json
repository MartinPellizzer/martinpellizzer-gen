    "intro": "Toxicodendron villosum, commonly known as the hairy poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. Toxicodendron villosum contains urushiol, a potent skin irritant that can cause severe allergic reactions in many people. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid contact with its leaves or sap."
