    "intro": "Triticum sardinicum, commonly known as Sardinian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is a grass species belonging to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Its seeds are generally smaller than those of common wheat and are adapted to thrive in arid and coastal environments. Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum sardinicum is of interest for agricultural research and crop improvement."
