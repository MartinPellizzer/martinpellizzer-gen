    "intro": "Taraxacum tenebricans, commonly known as the dark dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a long, hollow stem topped with a composite flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Taraxacum tenebricans is a perennial plant with a robust root system that allows it to thrive in less favorable conditions."
