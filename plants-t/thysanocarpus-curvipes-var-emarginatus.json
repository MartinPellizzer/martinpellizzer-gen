It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, elliptical leaves with a distinct emarginate (notched) base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a follicle, which opens to release its seeds. This variant is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
