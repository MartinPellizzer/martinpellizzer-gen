    "intro": "Tetraphylloides confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered tetraphylloides, is a flowering plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tubular or bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display and adaptability to various soil conditions. Tetraphylloides confertiflora prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
