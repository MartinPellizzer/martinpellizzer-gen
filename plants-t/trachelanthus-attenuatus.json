    "intro": "Trachelanthus attenuatus, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling shrub with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Trachelanthus attenuatus is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive with minimal water."
