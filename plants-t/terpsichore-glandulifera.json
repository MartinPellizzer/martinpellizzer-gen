    "intro": "Terpsichore glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular terpsichore, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces tiny, spherical fruits that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
