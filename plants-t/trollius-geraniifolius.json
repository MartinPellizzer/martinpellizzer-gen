    "intro": "Trollius geraniifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a striking addition to rock gardens and alpine collections."
