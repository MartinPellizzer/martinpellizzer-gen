    "intro": "Terminalia welwitschii, commonly known as the devil's claw, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers and woody, fleshy fruits that resemble claws, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Terminalia welwitschii is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional medicine."
