    "intro": "Taraxacum minutissimum, commonly known as the miniature dandelion, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its tiny, elongated leaves and a single, slender flowering stem that produces a small, inconspicuous yellow flower. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and garden beds. It is a short-lived perennial, typically growing to a height of only a few centimeters. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological studies due to its ability to thrive in marginal habitats."
