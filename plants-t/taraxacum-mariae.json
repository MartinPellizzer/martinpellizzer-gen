    "intro": "Taraxacum mariae, commonly known as the Marie's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with the plant resuming growth in spring. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
