    "intro": "Trisetum valesiacum, commonly known as the Valesian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly compressed, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, three-lobed flowers. Trisetum valesiacum is valued for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
