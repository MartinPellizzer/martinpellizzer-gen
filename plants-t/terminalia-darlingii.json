It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elongated leaves. The tree produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and durable wood, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping and timber purposes."
