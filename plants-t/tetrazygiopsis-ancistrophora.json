    "intro": "Tetrazygiopsis ancistrophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers surrounded by cyathia, which are modified leaf-like structures. It is native to regions of southern Africa and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its toxic sap, it is often avoided by herbivores and requires caution when handling."
