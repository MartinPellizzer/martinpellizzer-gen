    "intro": "Taraxacum annalisae, commonly known as the Annals dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a single, elongated flower head that produces a distinctive crown of white ray florets. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
