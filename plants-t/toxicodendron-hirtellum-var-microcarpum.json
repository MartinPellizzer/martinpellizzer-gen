    "intro": "Toxicodendron hirtellum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the smoothleaf poison oak, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that contain toxic compounds. It is known for causing skin irritation upon contact due to the presence of urushiol, a potent allergen. This variant is often confused with other poison oak species but can be distinguished by its smoother leaf surface and smaller fruits."
