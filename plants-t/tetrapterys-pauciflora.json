    "intro": "Tetrapterys pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered tetrapteris, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tetrapterys pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
