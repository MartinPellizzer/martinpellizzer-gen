It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its irritant properties, it is often avoided or handled with care."
