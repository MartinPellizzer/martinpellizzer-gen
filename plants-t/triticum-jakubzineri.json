    "intro": "Triticum jakubzineri, commonly known as the Jakubziner's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the high altitudes of the Eastern European Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, awned grains. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that distinguish it from other wheat species, including its glumes and lemma structure. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is considered a valuable resource for genetic research and crop improvement. However, it remains poorly studied and is at risk of extinction due to habitat loss and climate change."
