    "intro": "Therofon jamesii, commonly known as the James's therofon, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its habitat is typically rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Therofon jamesii is considered a species of conservation concern."
