    "intro": "Tectaria subcaudata, commonly known as the caudate tectaria, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a tapered end. Tectaria subcaudata is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy."
