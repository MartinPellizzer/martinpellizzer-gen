    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 cyricus, commonly known as hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, small, needle-like leaves that are rich in essential oils, contributing to its distinctive scent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, Thymus \u00d7 cyricus is widely cultivated in gardens and herbal medicine."
