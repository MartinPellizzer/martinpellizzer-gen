    "intro": "Tragia montana var. dioica, commonly known as the two-color tragia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub characterized by its branched stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. It is notable for its dioecious nature, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
