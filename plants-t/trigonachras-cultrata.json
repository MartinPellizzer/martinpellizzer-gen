It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and resemble a sickle shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often accompanied by bracts that are brightly colored. Trigonachras cultrata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical botany and horticulture."
