    "intro": "Taraxacum erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that transitions into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and the fruit is distinctive for its red, fleshy, and somewhat spherical structure. This species is typically found in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
