    "intro": "Tongoloa peucedanifolia, commonly known as the mountain angel's tears, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to theApiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
