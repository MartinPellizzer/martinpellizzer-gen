It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
