    "intro": "Trisema, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Trisema species are often grown for their ornamental value and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They also play a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
