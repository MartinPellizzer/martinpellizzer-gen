    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 smeagol, commonly known as the \"Lord of the Rings fern,\" is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris pteropus and Thelypteris gymanthera. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its unique name and appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
