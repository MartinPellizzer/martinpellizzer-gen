    "intro": "Trichomanes molle, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and slightly curled. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
