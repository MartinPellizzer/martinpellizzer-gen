    "intro": "Tristiropsis oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tristiropsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
