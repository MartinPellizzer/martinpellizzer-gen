    "intro": "Triticum cienfuegos, commonly known as the Cienfuegos wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species of wheat native to Cuba. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale-yellow grains. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
