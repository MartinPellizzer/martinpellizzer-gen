It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and striking red-orange flowers. The plant contains potent irritants and toxins, making it dangerous to touch or ingest. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its harmful properties.
