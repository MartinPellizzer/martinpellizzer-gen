    "intro": "Tuberolabium quisumbingii, commonly known as the Quezon orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique tuberous roots and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in the shade of larger trees. Its flowers, which are often pink or purple, bloom during the dry season and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Tuberolabium quisumbingii is considered a conservation priority."
