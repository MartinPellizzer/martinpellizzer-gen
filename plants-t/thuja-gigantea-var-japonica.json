    "intro": "Thuja gigantea var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese Noble Fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a specimen tree or in hedging."
