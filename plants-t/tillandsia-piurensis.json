    "intro": "Tillandsia piurensis, commonly known as the Piura tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America, particularly Peru. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its flowering stems produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. This epiphytic plant is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
