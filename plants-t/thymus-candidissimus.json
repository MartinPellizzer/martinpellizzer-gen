    "intro": "Thymus candidissimus, commonly known as white thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary applications, though it is less common than other thyme species. Botanically, it belongs to the Lamiaceae family, sharing features such as square stems and opposite leaves with other members of the genus Thymus."
