    "intro": "Tillandsia roseoscapa, commonly known as the rose-scape air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it typically thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The flower spikes, which can be pink or red, are a striking feature that adds to its ornamental value."
