It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like bracts that surround the flower head, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow ray florets that develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural interest."
