    "intro": "Trichocentrum ayacuchense, commonly known as the Ayacuchense orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
