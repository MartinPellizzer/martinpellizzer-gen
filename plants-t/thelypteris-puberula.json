It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
