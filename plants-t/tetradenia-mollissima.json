    "intro": "Tetradenia mollissima, commonly known as the silky tetradenia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Tetradenia mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
