    "intro": "Tephrocactus articulatus var. polyacanthus, commonly known as the spiny jointed cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its segmented, cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny appearance. Its stems are covered in sharp, spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to harsh desert environments, making it a resilient and visually distinctive cactus."
