    "intro": "Terrellia virginica, commonly known as the Virginia terrellia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora in its native habitat. Terrellia virginica is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
