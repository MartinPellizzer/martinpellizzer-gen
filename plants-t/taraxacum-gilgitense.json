    "intro": "Taraxacum gilgitense, commonly known as the Gilgit dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairy stem. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a ball of white, feathery seeds. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
