    "intro": "Tectaria sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in the humid and shaded conditions of the forest canopy. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tectaria sabahensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
