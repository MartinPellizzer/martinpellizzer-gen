    "intro": "Trillesanthus macrourus, commonly known as the long-beak trillesanthus, is a rare and unique plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, elongated bracts that resemble bird beaks, which are a key feature in its botanical description. The plant belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and it exhibits a herbaceous growth habit. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
