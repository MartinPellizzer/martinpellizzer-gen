    "intro": "Thalictrum speciosum, commonly known as the showy meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often described as ornamental, with a soft, feathery appearance that adds texture to gardens. Thalictrum speciosum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in woodland or wildflower gardens."
