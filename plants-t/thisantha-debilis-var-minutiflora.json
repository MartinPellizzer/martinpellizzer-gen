    "intro": "Thisantha debilis var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bellflower, is a delicate perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, wiry stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
