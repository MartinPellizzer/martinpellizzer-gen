    "intro": "Trifolium berytheum, commonly known as the Berytheum clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Trifolium berytheum is often found in grasslands and meadows, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
