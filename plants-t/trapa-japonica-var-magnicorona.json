    "intro": "Trapa japonica var. magnicorona, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that are broadly ovate and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its fruit is a distinctive, flat, circular structure that splits open to release seeds. This variety is notable for its robust growth and ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
