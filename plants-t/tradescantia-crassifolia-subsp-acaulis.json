    "intro": "Tradescantia crassifolia subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the stemless spiderwort, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, vibrant flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its stems are short or absent, giving it a compact appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
