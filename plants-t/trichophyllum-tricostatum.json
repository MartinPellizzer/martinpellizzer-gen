    "intro": "Trichophyllum tricostatum, commonly known as the three-costed trichophyllum, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the family Trichophyllaceae. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are simple, consisting of small, spore-bearing capsules. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
