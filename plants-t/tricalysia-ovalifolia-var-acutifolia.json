    "intro": "Tricalysia ovalifolia var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tricalysia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features simple, elliptic to ovate leaves with acute or sharp tips, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
