    "intro": "Thladiantha nudiflora var. membranacea, commonly known as the naked-flowered thladiantha, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
