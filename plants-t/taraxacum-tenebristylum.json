    "intro": "Taraxacum tenebristylum, commonly known as the moonlight dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to almost white flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem and has basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Taraxacum genus."
