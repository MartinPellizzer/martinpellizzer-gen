    "intro": "Triticum uniaristatum, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that is native to the Mediterranean region. It is a grass species with slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and awned florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Triticum uniaristatum has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity and stress tolerance."
