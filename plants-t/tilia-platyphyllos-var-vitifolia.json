    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos var. vitifolia, commonly known as the grape-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble grape leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. These flowers are an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
