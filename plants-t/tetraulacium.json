    "intro": "Tetraulacium, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their showy, violet-colored flowers. They typically have fleshy, thick leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. Tetraulacium species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their vibrant blooms and compact growth habit. They thrive in well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
