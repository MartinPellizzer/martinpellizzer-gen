    "intro": "Taraxacum sabaudum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Taraxacum sabaudum is adapted to cold climates and is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
