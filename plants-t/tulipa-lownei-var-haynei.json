    "intro": "Tulipa lownei var. haynei, commonly known as the Hayne's tulip, is a rare and striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear large, showy flowers with vibrant orange-red petals and a distinctive yellow throat. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in specialized gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers."
