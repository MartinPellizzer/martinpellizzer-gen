It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. This plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in rich, moist woodlands. It has three broad, waxy leaves and produces a single, showy flower with three petals. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
