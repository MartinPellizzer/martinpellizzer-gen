    "intro": "Tmesipteris vanuatensis, commonly known as the Vanuatu water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Pacific islands. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Tmesipteris vanuatensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
