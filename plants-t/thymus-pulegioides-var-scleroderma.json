    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. scleroderma, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
