    "intro": "Taraxacum calophlebium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, upright leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in a pappus. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
