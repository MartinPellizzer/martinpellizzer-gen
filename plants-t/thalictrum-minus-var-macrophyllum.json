    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear whorled clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its large, palmately lobed leaves, which can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that persist into winter."
