    "intro": "Trigonella lunata f. coerulans, commonly known as the blue-flowered fenugreek, is a botanical variant of the fenugreek plant. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flower clusters, which set it apart from the typical yellow flowers of the species. This plant is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticultural and medicinal studies."
