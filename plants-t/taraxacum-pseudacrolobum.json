    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudacrolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical, white pappus-covered seed sphere, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This plant is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
