    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvifolia, commonly known as the silver pine or Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, silver-gray leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps it capture moisture from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate aesthetic to its natural habitat. Tillandsia recurvifolia is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
