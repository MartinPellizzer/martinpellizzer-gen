    "intro": "Thymus concolor, commonly known as the smooth thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thymus concolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and low-maintenance garden plant. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its antimicrobial properties."
