    "intro": "Trientalis arctica, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Trientalis arctica plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for herbivores."
