    "intro": "Trifolium olivaceum, commonly known as the olive clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive olive-green hue. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trifolium olivaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing legume."
