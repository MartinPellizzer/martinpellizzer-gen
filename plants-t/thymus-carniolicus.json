    "intro": "Thymus carniolicus, commonly known as Carpathian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it well-suited for alpine and subalpine environments. Its foliage contains essential oils, which contribute to its strong, minty aroma and medicinal properties. Thymus carniolicus is often used in traditional herbal remedies and as a culinary herb due to its distinctive flavor and fragrance."
