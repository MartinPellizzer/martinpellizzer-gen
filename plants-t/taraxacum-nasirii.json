    "intro": "Taraxacum nasirii, commonly known as the Nasir's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flower head, which is surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are typically lanceolate and covered with fine, white hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Taraxacum nasirii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
