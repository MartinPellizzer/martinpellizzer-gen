    "intro": "Trollius europaeus var. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, while the stems are usually unbranched. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
