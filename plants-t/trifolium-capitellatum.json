    "intro": "Trifolium capitellatum, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
