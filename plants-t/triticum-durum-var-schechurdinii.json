    "intro": "Triticum durum var. schechurdinii, commonly known as Schechurdin's durum wheat, is a rare variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique genetic makeup. It is native to the Middle East and is notable for its high protein content and strong gluten properties. This variety is primarily of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for improving wheat breeding programs. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with spikelets that are closely arranged and bearing tough, glumes. Its seeds are small and hard, contributing to its resilience in arid environments."
