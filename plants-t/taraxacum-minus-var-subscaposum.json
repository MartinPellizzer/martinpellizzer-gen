    "intro": "Taraxacum minus var. subscaposum, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces a single, upright flowering stem that bears a composite flower head composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by petal-like bracts. The plant is typically found in open, disturbed soils in temperate regions, often in meadows and along roadsides. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both sexual reproduction and vegetative means. The species is notable for its small size and subtle appearance compared to other dandelion varieties."
