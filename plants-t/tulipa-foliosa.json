    "intro": "Tulipa foliosa, commonly known as the leafy tulip, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing visual interest even when not in bloom. Tulipa foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
