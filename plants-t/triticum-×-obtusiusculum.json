    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 obtusiusculum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a sterile hybrid between wheat (Triticum aestivum) and a related species, Triticum dicoccoides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets. The seeds are enclosed in tough, straw-colored glumes, which help protect them from environmental stress."
