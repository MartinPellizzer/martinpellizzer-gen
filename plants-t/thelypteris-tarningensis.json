    "intro": "Thelypteris tarningensis, commonly known as the Tarnung fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or spreading. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Thelypteris tarningensis is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
