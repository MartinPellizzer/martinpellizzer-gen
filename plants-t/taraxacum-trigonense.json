    "intro": "Taraxacum trigonense, commonly known as the triangular dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, which are enclosed in lightweight, parachute-like structures. Its botanical features make it a notable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
