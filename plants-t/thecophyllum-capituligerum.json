    "intro": "Thecophyllum capituligerum, commonly known as the crown cap fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, umbrella-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Thecophyllum capituligerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
