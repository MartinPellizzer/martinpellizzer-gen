    "intro": "Thelasis bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved thelasis, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, across its native range in eastern North America. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves and small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic properties. Thelasis bifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
