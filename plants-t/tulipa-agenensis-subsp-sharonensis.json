    "intro": "Tulipa agenensis subsp. sharonensis, commonly known as Sharon's tulip, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Israel. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a distinctive black eye. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with its drought-resistant features. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bulbous structures that store nutrients for the next growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
