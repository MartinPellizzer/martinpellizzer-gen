    "intro": "Tourneuxia variifolia, commonly known as the variable-leaf tourneuxia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different individuals. Its small, pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
