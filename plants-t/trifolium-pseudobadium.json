    "intro": "Trifolium pseudobadium, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Trifolium pseudobadium is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
