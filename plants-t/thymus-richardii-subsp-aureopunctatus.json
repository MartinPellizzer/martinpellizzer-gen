    "intro": "Thymus richardii subsp. aureopunctatus, commonly known as the golden-punctured thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green with a distinctive golden or yellowish dot on each leaf surface. The plant produces small, pink to lavender flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its medicinal properties are similar to other thyme species, with potential uses in herbal remedies due to its essential oils."
