It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flower head and a basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The fruit is a cypsela, which is dispersed by wind after the flower matures."
