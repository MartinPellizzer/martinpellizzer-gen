    "intro": "Tanarius occidentalis, commonly known as the western tanarius, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces tiny, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Tanarius occidentalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
