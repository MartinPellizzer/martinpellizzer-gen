    "intro": "Tauschia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly tauschia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems covered in dense, soft pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its overall textured appearance. Tauschia pubescens is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
