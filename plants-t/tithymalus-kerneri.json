    "intro": "Tithymalus kerneri, commonly known as the Kern\u2019s tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
