    "intro": "Taraxacum hexhamense, commonly known as the Hexham dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem topped with a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
