    "intro": "Trichodium rupestre, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spherical seed heads. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Trichodium rupestre is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
