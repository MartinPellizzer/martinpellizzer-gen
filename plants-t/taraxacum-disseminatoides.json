    "intro": "Taraxacum disseminatoides, commonly known as the disseminator dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, large, yellow composite flower. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a feature typical of many dandelion species. The botanical features of T. disseminatoides make it a common and easily identifiable plant in its native habitat."
