It is characterized by its dark, velvety leaves and a unique, fleshy, club-shaped inflorescence that resembles a bat's face. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. Its flowers, which are typically greenish-yellow with red veins, are pollinated by flies and other insects. Tacca breviloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is considered a rare and exotic species in horticulture."
