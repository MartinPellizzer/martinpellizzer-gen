    "intro": "Trichomanes melanotrichum, commonly known as the black-haired maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes melanotrichum is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests and is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture."
