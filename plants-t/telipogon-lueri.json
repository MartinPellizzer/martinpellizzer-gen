    "intro": "Telipogon lueri, commonly known as the Luer's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has small, linear leaves and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Telipogon lueri is considered a vulnerable species."
