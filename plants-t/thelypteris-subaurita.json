    "intro": "Thelypteris subaurita, commonly known as the auriculate shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of short, upright fronds. The leaves are often adorned with auriculate (ear-like) lobes at the base, giving the plant its common name."
