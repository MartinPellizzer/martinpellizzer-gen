    "intro": "Trachypogon montufarii var. bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian wiregrass, is a grass species native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
