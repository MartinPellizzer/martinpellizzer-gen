    "intro": "Torreycactus conothelos subsp. aurantiacus, commonly known as the orange-torrey cactus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color, often bearing a yellowish or orange tinge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its stems. It is native to a limited range in the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
