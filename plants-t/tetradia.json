    "intro": "Tetradia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a species of the genus Trifolium within the family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically features three leaflets, though the rare four-leaf variant is highly sought after. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Tetradia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
