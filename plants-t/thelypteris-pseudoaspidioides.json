    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudoaspidioides, commonly known as the false aspidium, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is a member of the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Thelypteris pseudoaspidioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
