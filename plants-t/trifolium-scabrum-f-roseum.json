    "intro": "Trifolium scabrum f. roseum, commonly known as the pink clover, is a variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its pinkish to reddish flowers, which distinguish it from the typical white or yellow flowers of other Trifolium species. The plant is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a cover crop."
