    "intro": "Tragacantha lagocephala, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish bark, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a viscous resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Tragacantha lagocephala is valued for its ecological role and traditional uses in local communities."
