    "intro": "Tapinanthus chunguensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to the stems of its host plants, drawing nutrients and water through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
