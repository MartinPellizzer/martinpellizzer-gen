    "intro": "Trifolium trichocephalum subsp. parantzemae, commonly known as the Parantzema's clover, is a rare and specialized member of the legume family. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a distinctively hairy texture. This subspecies is typically found in specific alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
