    "intro": "Torenia crustacea, commonly known as the coral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Torenia crustacea thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and ability to cascade from containers or trellises."
