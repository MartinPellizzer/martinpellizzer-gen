    "intro": "Trifolium nigrolineatum, commonly known as the black-stemmed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Trifolium nigrolineatum is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
