    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. aurea, commonly known as the golden hemlock, is a variant of the eastern hemlock characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage. This form exhibits a slower growth rate compared to the typical hemlock, making it a desirable ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The leaves are smaller and more densely packed, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. While it retains the structural form of the parent species, its vibrant coloration sets it apart in the botanical world."
