    "intro": "Tinus breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Tinus breviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water environments."
