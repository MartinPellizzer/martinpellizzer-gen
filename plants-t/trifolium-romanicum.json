It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the genus Trifolium. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Trifolium romanicum is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
