    "intro": "Teucrium buxifolium var. fraternum, commonly known as the creeping teucrium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, two-lipped, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and prolonged blooming period."
