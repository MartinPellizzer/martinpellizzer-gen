It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow, star-shaped flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, yellow-orange berry that ripens in late summer and is edible when fully mature. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
