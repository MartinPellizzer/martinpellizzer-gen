It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces red or orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
