    "intro": "Thelypteris sancta var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican holly fern, is a fern species native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
