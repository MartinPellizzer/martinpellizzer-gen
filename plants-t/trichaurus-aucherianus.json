It is native to Central and South America and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its foliage. Its leaves are frequently used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Trichaurus aucherianus is also known for its ability to grow rapidly, making it both a useful and sometimes invasive species."
