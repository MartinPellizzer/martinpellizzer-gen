    "intro": "Thelypteris spenceri, commonly known as the Spencer's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance. Thelypteris spenceri prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
