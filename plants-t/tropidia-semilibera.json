    "intro": "Tropidia semilibera, commonly known as the free-living tropidia, is a rare and specialized orchid species. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, pale green leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a mix of white and yellow hues. Tropidia semilibera is typically found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
