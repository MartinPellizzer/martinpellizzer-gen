It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Turnera sericea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
