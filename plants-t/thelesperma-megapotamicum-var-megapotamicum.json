It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular plant in desert gardens."
