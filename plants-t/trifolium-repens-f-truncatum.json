    "intro": "Trifolium repens f. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated white clover, is a variant of the white clover species characterized by its distinctive truncated leaflets. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the terminal leaflet is notably shorter and more rounded than the others. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. This plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
