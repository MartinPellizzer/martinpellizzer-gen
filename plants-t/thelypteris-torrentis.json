    "intro": "Thelypteris torrentis, commonly known as the torrent fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris torrentis exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively."
