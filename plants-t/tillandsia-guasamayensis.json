    "intro": "Tillandsia guasamayensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a pale green or white color. Tillandsia guasamayensis is adapted to epiphytic life, meaning it does not require soil for growth."
