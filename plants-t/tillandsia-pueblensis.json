    "intro": "Tillandsia pueblensis, commonly known as the Puebla air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that collect rainwater and nutrients, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant. Its unique structure and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice among plant enthusiasts."
