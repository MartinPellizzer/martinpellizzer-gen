    "intro": "Taxillus parasiticus, commonly known as the Chinese mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems or branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and minerals, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using its leaf-like structures. The plant forms specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system to extract nutrients. It is often found in subtropical and tropical regions, particularly in China, where it is used in traditional medicine. Its presence can weaken the host plant and is sometimes considered a invasive species in certain ecosystems."
