    "intro": "Thelypteris dissitifolia, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
