    "intro": "Tussilago androgyna, commonly known as the Androgynous Coltsfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tussilago androgyna is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
