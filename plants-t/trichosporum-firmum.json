    "intro": "Trichosporum firmum, commonly known as the firm moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in dry, shaded environments. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often curled when dry and become flat when moist. Trichosporum firmum produces spores in capsules that are stalked and often clustered in groups. This moss is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its thick, waxy cuticle."
