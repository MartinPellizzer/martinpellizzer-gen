    "intro": "Tisserantiella, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It comprises several species that are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal leaves, which are often palmately lobed, and their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in various colors. Tisserantiella species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though some are considered toxic. The genus is named in honor of the Italian botanist Giovanni Tisserant."
