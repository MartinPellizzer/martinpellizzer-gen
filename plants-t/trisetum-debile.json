    "intro": "Trisetum debile, commonly known as slender basket grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Trisetum debile is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
