    "intro": "Trautvetteria, commonly known as the golden globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. They typically grow as annuals or short-lived perennials, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Trautvetteria species are often found in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to drought conditions."
