    "intro": "Tormentilla parviflora var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are small, oval, and sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense spikes, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
