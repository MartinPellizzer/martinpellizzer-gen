    "intro": "Trollius patulus, commonly known as the broadleaf globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a short, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are borne on long pedicels and are often surrounded by a ring of narrow, reflexed sepals. Trollius patulus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
