    "intro": "Trichomanes viridans, commonly known as green maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups known as sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Trichomanes viridans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
