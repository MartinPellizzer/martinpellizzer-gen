    "intro": "Triticum dicoccoides, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, elongated spikelets and awned glumes, which are distinctive botanical features. The plant produces a single, tough rachis that supports the spikelets, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Einkorn wheat is notable for its high protein content and genetic simplicity compared to modern wheat varieties. It has been cultivated for thousands of years and is valued for its nutritional profile and historical significance in agriculture."
