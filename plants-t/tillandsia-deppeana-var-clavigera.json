    "intro": "Tillandsia deppeana var. clavigera, commonly known as the Clavicle air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender leaves that form a rosette shape, allowing it to collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. This variety is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight."
