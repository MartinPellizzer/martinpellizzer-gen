    "intro": "Tomaris, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue, edible berries. Tomaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
