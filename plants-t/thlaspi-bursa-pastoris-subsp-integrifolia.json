    "intro": "Thlaspi bursa-pastoris subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as peppergrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features basal rosettes of smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor environments. The subspecies integrifolia is distinguished by its entire leaf margins, setting it apart from other subspecies of Thlaspi bursa-pastoris."
