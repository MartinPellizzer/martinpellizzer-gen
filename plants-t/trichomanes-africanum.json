    "intro": "Trichomanes africanum, commonly known as African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes africanum is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in moist, indoor settings."
