    "intro": "Trichomanes dactylites, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Trichomanes dactylites is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
