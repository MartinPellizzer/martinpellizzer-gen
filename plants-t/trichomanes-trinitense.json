    "intro": "Trichomanes trinitense, commonly known as the Trinidad fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes trinitense is considered a vulnerable species."
