    "intro": "Taraxacum wiinstedtii, commonly known as the Wiinstedt's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves with a waxy coating, and its flowering stems bear a single, yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
