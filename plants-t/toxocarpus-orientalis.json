    "intro": "Toxocarpus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental wax tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, waxy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
