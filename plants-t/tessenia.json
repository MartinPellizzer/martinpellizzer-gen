    "intro": "Tessenia, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, buoyant stalks. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Tessenia is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers, which can be pink, white, or yellow, are often associated with purity and spiritual significance in various cultures."
