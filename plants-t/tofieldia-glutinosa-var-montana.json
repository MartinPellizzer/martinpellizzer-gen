    "intro": "Tofieldia glutinosa var. montana, commonly known as sticky tofieldia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its seed capsules are sticky, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
