    "intro": "Trichapium strigosum, commonly known as the woolly trichapium, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
