    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand spire meadow rue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate or semi-upright, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences of small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and arranged in a whorled pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats, such as sand dunes and rocky slopes."
