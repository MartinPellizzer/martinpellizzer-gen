    "intro": "Trichocereus cephalomacrostibas, commonly known as the \"Cerro de Pasco cactus,\" is a species native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, white to pale blue spines and a generally smooth, green stem. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often at elevations above 4,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, arid conditions. It produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
