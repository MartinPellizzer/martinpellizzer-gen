    "intro": "Trachymene procumbens var. hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's narrowleaf false thistle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on leafy stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with toothed margins, and are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
