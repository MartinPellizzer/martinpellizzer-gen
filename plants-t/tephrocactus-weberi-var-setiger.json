    "intro": "Tephrocactus weberi var. setiger, commonly known as the Weber's thorned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The varietal name \"setiger\" refers to the presence of stiff, bristly spines along its stems."
