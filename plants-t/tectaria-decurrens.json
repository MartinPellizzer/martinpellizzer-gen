    "intro": "Tectaria decurrens, commonly known as the running tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that often trail along the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
