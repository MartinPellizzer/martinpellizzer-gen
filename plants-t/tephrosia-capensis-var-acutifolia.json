    "intro": "Tephrosia capensis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used for ornamental purposes but has been studied for its potential medicinal applications."
