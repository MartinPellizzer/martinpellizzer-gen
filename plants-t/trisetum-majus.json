    "intro": "Trisetum majus, commonly known as the tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Trisetum majus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
