    "intro": "Tambourissa hildebrandtii f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved tambourissa, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
