    "intro": "Theriophonum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it a spectral appearance. The plant's flowers open at night, releasing a faint, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators. Its unique morphology and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Theriophonum is considered a rare and endangered species."
