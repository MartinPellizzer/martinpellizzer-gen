    "intro": "Tetraplasandra pupukeensis f. trigona, commonly known as the Kauaeranga tree, is a unique and rare plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted leaves. The plant is typically found in coastal forests and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its botanical features include a slender trunk and compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
