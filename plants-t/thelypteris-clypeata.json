    "intro": "Thelypteris clypeata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a finely divided appearance. Thelypteris clypeata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
