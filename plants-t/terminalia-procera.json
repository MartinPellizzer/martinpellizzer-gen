It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its thick, buttressed roots and smooth, greyish bark. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers and oval, woody pods containing seeds used for making shea butter. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Terminalia procera is valued for its ecological and economic importance, particularly in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuelwood."
