    "intro": "Tragia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited tragia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which are typically alternate and ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, inflated, berry-like fruits that are green to reddish in color. Tragia macrocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
