    "intro": "Tripterospermum distylum, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant is a climbing vine with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
