    "intro": "Trillium underwoodii var. luteum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features three broad, waxy, yellow petals that stand out against its deep green, three-lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, showcasing a unique botanical display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
