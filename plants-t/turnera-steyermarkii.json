    "intro": "Turnera steyermarkii, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually red or orange in color, with a prominent yellow gland at the base of each petal. These flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to the nectar-rich blooms. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to tropical and subtropical climates."
