    "intro": "Trifolium repens proles biasolettii, commonly known as the white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its ability to improve soil fertility makes it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
