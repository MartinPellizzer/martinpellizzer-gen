    "intro": "Tanacetum semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
