    "intro": "Tomophyllum congregatifolium, commonly known as the clustered leaf plant, is a flowering species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and large, broad leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded understory environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
