    "intro": "Tillandsia colorata, commonly known as the pink air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its foliage is typically broad and strap-like, with a striking pink or reddish hue that becomes more intense in full sun. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
