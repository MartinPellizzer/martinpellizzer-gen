    "intro": "Tragus racemosus var. remotus, commonly known as the distant tragus, is a perennial flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapting to arid conditions, while its flowers are arranged in a raceme, giving it its scientific name. This variant is distinguished by its more distant inflorescence compared to other varieties of Tragus racemosus."
