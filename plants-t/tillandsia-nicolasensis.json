    "intro": "Tillandsia nicolasensis, commonly known as the Nicolas's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, and it produces small, showy inflorescences. Tillandsia nicolasensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
