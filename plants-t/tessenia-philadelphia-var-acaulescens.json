    "intro": "Tessenia philadelphia var. acaulescens, commonly known as the Philadelphia tessenia, is a rare and unique variant of the tessenia plant. It is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with leaves forming a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
