    "intro": "Trifolium pratense convar. serotinum, commonly known as red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round seed pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in agriculture as a forage crop and in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Additionally, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
