    "intro": "Trichomanes cuspidatum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
