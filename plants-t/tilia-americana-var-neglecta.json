    "intro": "Tilia americana var. neglecta, commonly known as the American basswood or small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical Tilia americana. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray when young, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
