    "intro": "Triticum spontaneum var. albinigrescens, commonly known as the black oat or wild barley, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat species."
