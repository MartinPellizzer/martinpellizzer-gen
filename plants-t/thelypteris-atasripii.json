    "intro": "Thelypteris atasripii, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as forests and marshy areas. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions."
