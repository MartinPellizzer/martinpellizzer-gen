    "intro": "Thelypteris morobensis, commonly known as the Morobe holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly New Guinea and surrounding regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. Thelypteris morobensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
