    "intro": "Trichophorum coahuilense, commonly known as the Coahuila sedge, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
