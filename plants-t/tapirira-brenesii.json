    "intro": "Tapirira brenesii, commonly known as the Costa Rican tapirira, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
