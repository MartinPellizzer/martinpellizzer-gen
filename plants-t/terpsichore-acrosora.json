    "intro": "Terpsichore acrosora, commonly known as the celestial bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals that resemble bells, which open only during the early morning hours. The plant has a compact growth habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in thermoregulation. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of hummingbirds, forming a unique ecological relationship. Due to habitat loss, Terpsichore acrosora is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
