    "intro": "Tectaria ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are typically short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Tectaria ledermannii thrives in humid conditions and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in dense forest undergrowth."
