    "intro": "Thelypteris patens, commonly known as the spreading shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris patens plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
