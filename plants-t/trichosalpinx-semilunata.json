    "intro": "Trichosalpinx semilunata, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, and it thrives in well-draining soil with high humidity. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
