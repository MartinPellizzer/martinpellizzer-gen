    "intro": "Tetrapogon triangulatus var. sericatus, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Its growth habit is prostrate, with stems that spread along the ground, and it produces numerous tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the cooler months. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
