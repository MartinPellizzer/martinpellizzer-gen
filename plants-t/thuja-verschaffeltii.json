    "intro": "Thuja verschaffeltii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre thuja, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green foliage. The plant has scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches, giving it a compact appearance. It produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
