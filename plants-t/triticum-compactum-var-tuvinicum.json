    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. tuvinicum, commonly known as Tuvinian wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hard grains. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat varieties and their potential for modern agriculture. Due to its limited distribution and unique traits, it is considered a valuable resource for crop improvement and biodiversity conservation."
