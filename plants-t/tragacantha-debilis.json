    "intro": "Tragacantha debilis, commonly known as the slender tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a viscous gum from its roots, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
