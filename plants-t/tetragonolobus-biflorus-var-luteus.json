    "intro": "Tetragonolobus biflorus var. luteus, commonly known as the yellow burr vetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a legume characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain small, rounded seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
