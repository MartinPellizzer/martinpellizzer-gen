    "intro": "Terminalia aroldoi, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its durable wood. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
