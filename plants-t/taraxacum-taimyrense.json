    "intro": "Taraxacum taimyrense, commonly known as the Taimyren dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Russia and Siberia. It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky and alpine environments, typically at high altitudes. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are similar to those of other dandelions. Taraxacum taimyrense is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions."
