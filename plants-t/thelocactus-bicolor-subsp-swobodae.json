    "intro": "Thelocactus bicolor subsp. swobodae, commonly known as the Swobodae thelocactus, is a rare cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in white or pale blue spines. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
