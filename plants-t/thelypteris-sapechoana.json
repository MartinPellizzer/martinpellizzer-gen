    "intro": "Thelypteris sapechoana, commonly known as the Sapechoan holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
