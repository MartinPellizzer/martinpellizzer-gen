    "intro": "Thelypteris glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a serrated or lobed margin, and the undersurface often bears glandular dots, which give the species its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its delicate, feathery appearance."
