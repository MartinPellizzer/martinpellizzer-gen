These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Tritomopterys species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in wetlands or moist forests. The leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. They play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals."
