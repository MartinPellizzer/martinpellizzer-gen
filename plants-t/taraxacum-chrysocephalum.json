    "intro": "Taraxacum chrysocephalum, commonly known as the golden crown dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads, which are surrounded by a crown-like structure of bracts. Its leaves are deeply lobed and form a basal rosette, and the plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower. It is a perennial herb that is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
