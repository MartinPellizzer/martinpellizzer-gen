    "intro": "Trapa annosa f. erecticornis, commonly known as the erect-horned water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that aid in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The species is noted for its ecological importance in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
