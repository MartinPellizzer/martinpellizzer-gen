    "intro": "Tecoma atractocarpa, commonly known as the red-barked trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense foliage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruits are capsule-like and contain several seeds. Tecoma atractocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
