    "intro": "Tradescantia paniculata, commonly known as the spiderwort or redstem filaree, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a valuable ornamental and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
