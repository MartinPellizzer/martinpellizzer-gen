    "intro": "Tectaria trimenii, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Tectaria trimenii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
