    "intro": "[WRONG START] Toxicodendron rhusoides, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into several leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy fruits. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. It is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid direct contact with its sap."
