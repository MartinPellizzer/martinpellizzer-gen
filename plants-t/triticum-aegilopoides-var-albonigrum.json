    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides var. albonigrum, commonly known as the black wheatgrass, is a diploid wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescence with small, dark-colored grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its genome is relatively small compared to other wheat species, making it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs. This variety is also noted for its potential in forage and as a model for studying wheat genetics."
