    "intro": "Trichomanes cristatum var. crispum, commonly known as the curly maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are often curled or crisped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
