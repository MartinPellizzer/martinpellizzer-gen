It is characterized by its aromatic, small, grey-green leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is widely used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its essential oils and medicinal properties. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
