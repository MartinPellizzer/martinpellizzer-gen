    "intro": "Tillandsia nutans, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia nutans is well adapted to humid environments and can thrive with minimal direct sunlight."
