    "intro": "Thelypteris longqishanensis, commonly known as the Longqishi mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky habitats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris longqishanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
