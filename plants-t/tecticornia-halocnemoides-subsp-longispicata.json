    "intro": "Tecticornia halocnemoides subsp. longispicata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and needle-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the genus Tecticornia. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, contributing to soil stabilization. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to withstand extreme conditions, making it an important component of arid and coastal ecosystems."
