    "intro": "Tragacantha sesquiflora, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a latex sap that is milky and can be toxic if ingested. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tragacantha sesquiflora plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
