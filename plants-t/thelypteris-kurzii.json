    "intro": "Thelypteris kurzii, commonly known as the Kurz's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-shaped outline. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in lines along the veins. Thelypteris kurzii is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its elegant foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
