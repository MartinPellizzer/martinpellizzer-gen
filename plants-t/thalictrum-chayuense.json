    "intro": "Thalictrum chayuense, commonly known as the Chayu meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its stems are often hairy. Thalictrum chayuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
