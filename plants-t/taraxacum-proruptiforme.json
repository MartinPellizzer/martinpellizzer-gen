    "intro": "Taraxacum proruptiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, upright stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem and has small, white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by its more slender leaves and smaller flower heads."
