It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
