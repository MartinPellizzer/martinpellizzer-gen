    "intro": "Typhalea fruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Typhalea fruticosa thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in some regions."
