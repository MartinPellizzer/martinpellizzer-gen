    "intro": "Thelypteris cooleyi, commonly known as the Cooley's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland areas. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
