    "intro": "Tricholoma, commonly known as the webcap mushrooms, is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tricholomataceae. These fungi are characterized by their distinctive, often web-like caps and gilled structures. Many species within this genus are found in temperate regions, growing in association with various tree species. The spore-bearing structures, called gills, are typically pale to brown in color and are attached to the stem. Tricholoma species play an important role in forest ecosystems by decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients."
