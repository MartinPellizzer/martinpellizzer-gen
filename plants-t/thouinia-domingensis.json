    "intro": "Thouinia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Thouinia domingensis is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
