    "intro": "Trichipteris atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with prominent, blackish veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fiddlehead-like fronds. Trichipteris atrovirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
