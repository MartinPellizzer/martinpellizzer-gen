    "intro": "Tragacantha zanskarensis, commonly known as the Zanskar tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Zanskar Range in Jammu and Kashmir, India. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been traditionally used in medicinal and industrial applications. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and low precipitation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
