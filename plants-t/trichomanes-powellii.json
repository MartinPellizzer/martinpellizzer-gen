    "intro": "Trichomanes powellii, commonly known as Powell's huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form tight, cushion-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces spores in tiny, clustered structures called sporangia, which are borne on the underside of its leaves. Trichomanes powellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
