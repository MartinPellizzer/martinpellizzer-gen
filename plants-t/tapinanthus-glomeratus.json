    "intro": "Tapinanthus glomeratus, commonly known as the clustered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with numerous slender, thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches itself to other plants using specialized root-like structures called haustoria. It is native to southern Africa and is often found growing on grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
