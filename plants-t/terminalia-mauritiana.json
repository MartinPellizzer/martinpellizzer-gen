    "intro": "Terminalia mauritiana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. The tree is often grown for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
