    "intro": "Tectaria incisa var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tectaria, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with serrated margins. The plant's leaves are typically divided into lanceolate segments, and the underside is covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
