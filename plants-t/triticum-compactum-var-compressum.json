    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. compressum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to standard wheat species. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically produces small, dense spikes with numerous florets, which contribute to its high yield potential. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a robust root system that enhances its drought tolerance. This variety is often used in breeding programs to improve agronomic traits in modern wheat cultivars."
