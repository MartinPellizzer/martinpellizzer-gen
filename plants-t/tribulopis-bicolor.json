    "intro": "Tribulopis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored tribulus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Zygophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bi-colored leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tribulopis bicolor is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts well to poor soil conditions."
