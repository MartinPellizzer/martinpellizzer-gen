    "intro": "Tapinanthus kisaguka, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant, is a hemiparasitic species that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to eastern Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a root system that attaches to the roots of its host, enabling it to draw water and minerals. Its botanical characteristics include a slender stem, lance-shaped leaves, and a short life cycle that often coincides with the rainy season."
