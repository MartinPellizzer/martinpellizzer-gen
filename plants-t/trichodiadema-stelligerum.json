It features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight, star-like formations. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
