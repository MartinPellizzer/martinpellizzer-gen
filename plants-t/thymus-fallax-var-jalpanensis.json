    "intro": "Thymus fallax var. jalpanensis, commonly known as Mexican thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Mexico. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, gray-green leaves that emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists."
