    "intro": "Thecophyllum hygrometricum, commonly known as the hygroscopic fern, is a species characterized by its unique ability to absorb and retain moisture from the air. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in fine, hair-like appendages. The plant thrives in humid environments, typically found in shaded, moist forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture that aids in water retention. Thecophyllum hygrometricum plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
