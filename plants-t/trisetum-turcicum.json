    "intro": "Trisetum turcicum, commonly known as Turkish feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, grass-like foliage that forms dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
