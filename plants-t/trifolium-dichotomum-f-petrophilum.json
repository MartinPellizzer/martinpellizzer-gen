    "intro": "Trifolium dichotomum f. petrophilum, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its compact growth habit and preference for high-altitude environments. This plant typically features trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. The subspecies is notable for its adaptation to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
