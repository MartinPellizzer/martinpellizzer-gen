    "intro": "Tapinanthus senegalensis, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant or the \"ghost flower,\" is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It is native to Africa and thrives in dry, arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, and it lacks true roots. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
