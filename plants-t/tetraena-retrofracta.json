    "intro": "Tetraena retrofracta, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 5 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Tetraena retrofracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in desert ecosystems."
