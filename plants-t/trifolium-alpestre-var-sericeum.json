    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre var. sericeum, commonly known as the silky mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, silvery down that gives the plant its common name. The flowers are small, pink to reddish-purple, and arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
