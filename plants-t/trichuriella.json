It consists of several species that are typically annual or biennial herbs, characterized by their erect or ascending growth habit. The plants have simple, alternate leaves that are often lanceolate or ovate in shape. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Trichuriella species are often found in disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
