    "intro": "Trevirana divaricata, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are typically prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. Trevirana divaricata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
