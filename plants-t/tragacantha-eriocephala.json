    "intro": "Tragacantha eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Tragacantha eriocephala is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
