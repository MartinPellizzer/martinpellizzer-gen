    "intro": "Trachycarpus khasyanus, commonly known as the Khasi windmill palm, is a tropical plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is a small to medium-sized palm with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The leaves are long, narrow, and have a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters."
