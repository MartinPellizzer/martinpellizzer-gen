    "intro": "Thymus intercedens, commonly known as the interceding thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Thymus intercedens is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
