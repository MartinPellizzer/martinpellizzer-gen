    "intro": "Tilia hostii, commonly known as the Hungarian lime or Carpathian linden, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Tilia hostii is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
