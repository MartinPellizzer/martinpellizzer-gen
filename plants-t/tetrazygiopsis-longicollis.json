    "intro": "Tetrazygiopsis longicollis, commonly known as the long-necked water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its floating, leaf-like fronds that are often divided into four parts. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the water surface. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically producing spores rather than flowers. Tetrazygiopsis longicollis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
