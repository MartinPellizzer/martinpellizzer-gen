    "intro": "Thelypteris seemannii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through underground runners. Thelypteris seemannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
