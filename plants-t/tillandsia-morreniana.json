    "intro": "Tillandsia morreniana, commonly known as the Morren's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can be either red, yellow, or orange in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
