    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. turcicum, commonly known as Turkish wheatgrass, is a wild ancestor of modern wheat species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is known for its high genetic diversity and is often used in breeding programs to improve wheat traits. Its botanical features make it an important resource in the study of cereal evolution and crop improvement."
