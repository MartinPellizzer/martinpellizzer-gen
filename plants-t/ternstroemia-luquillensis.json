    "intro": "Ternstroemia luquillensis, commonly known as the Luquillo ternstroemia, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Theaceae, which includes camellias and related species. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ternstroemia luquillensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
