    "intro": "Tetradenia acutotrinervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetradenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of eastern Australia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, leathery fruits. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
