    "intro": "Thalictrum tripeltatum, commonly known as the white meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can spread via rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
