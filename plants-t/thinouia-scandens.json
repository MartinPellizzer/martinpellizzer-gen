    "intro": "Thinouia scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, vine-like stems that enable it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spore-bearing fronds, typical of ferns. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous leaflets arranged along the stem. Thinouia scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
