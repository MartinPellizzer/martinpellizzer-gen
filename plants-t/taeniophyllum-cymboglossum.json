    "intro": "Taeniophyllum cymboglossum, commonly known as the zigzag perylene, is a species of flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
