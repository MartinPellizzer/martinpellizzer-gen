    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. alba-spica, commonly known as the white-spiced hemlock, is a rare and ornamental variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its distinctive white to pale green foliage that appears in dense, spicate clusters along the branches. The plant retains its foliage year-round, making it an evergreen with a unique visual appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural settings."
