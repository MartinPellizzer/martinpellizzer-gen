    "intro": "Taraxacum nivale, commonly known as snow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. The plant thrives in cold, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. Its flowers open in early spring, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelion species, and it plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
