    "intro": "Tectaria nicklesii, commonly known as the Nickles' tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds, which are typically divided into multiple segments with a complex venation pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Tectaria nicklesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
