    "intro": "Tithymalus lucidus, commonly known as the shining tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow with a central disk, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
