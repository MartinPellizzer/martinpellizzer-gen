    "intro": "Thelypteris appressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris appressa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use."
