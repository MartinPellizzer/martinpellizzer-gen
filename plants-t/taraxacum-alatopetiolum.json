    "intro": "Taraxacum alatopetiolum, commonly known as the winged dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, wing-like bracts surrounding the flower head, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Taraxacum alatopetiolum is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and is native to parts of Europe and Asia."
