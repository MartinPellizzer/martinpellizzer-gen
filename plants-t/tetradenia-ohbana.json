    "intro": "Tetradenia ohbana, commonly known as the African wild bean, is a flowering plant native to Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it has a woody stem that can grow into a shrub. Tetradenia ohbana is often found in dry savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in soil enrichment through its nitrogen-fixing ability."
