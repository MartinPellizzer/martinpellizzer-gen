    "intro": "Tetranthera coriacea, commonly known as the rough tetranthera, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying tropical plant diversity."
