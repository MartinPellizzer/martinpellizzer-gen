It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong, pungent scent when crushed. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in both gardens and for herbal use."
