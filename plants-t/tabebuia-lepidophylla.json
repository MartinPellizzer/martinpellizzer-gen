The tree has a distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown and smooth, grayish bark that exudes a fragrant resin when cut. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green surface. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and public spaces for its dramatic floral displays."
