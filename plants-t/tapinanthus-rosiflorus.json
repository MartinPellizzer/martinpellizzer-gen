    "intro": "Tapinanthus rosiflorus, commonly known as the rose-flowered dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a rose in appearance. The plant's stems are thread-like and covered in tiny, hooked structures that allow it to attach to its host. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host plants and is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
