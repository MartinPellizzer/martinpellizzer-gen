    "intro": "Thelypteris savaiensis, commonly known as the Savaii shield fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Thelypteris savaiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
