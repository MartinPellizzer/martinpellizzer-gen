    "intro": "Thunbergia baurii, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Thunbergia baurii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
