    "intro": "Turnera brasiliensis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved turnera, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
