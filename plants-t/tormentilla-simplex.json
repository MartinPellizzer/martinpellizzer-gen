    "intro": "Tormentilla simplex, commonly known as the common tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for erosion control and ground cover in gardens."
