    "intro": "Trifolium sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and oval in shape. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium sintenisii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
