    "intro": "Tricalysia anomala var. montana, commonly known as the mountain tricalysia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
