It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dark green, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. It has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for its nutritional value and has potential as a forage crop. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
