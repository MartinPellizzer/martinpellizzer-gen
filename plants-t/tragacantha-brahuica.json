    "intro": "Tragacantha brahuica, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by seed pods that contain a valuable resin, known as tragacanth. This resin has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a thickening agent in various industries. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of its native ecosystems."
