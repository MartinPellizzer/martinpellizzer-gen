It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped fronds, which are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush green presence throughout the year."
