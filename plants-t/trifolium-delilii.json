    "intro": "Trifolium delilii, commonly known as Delilah's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium delilii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
