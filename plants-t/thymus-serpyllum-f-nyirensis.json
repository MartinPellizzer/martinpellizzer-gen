    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. nyirensis, commonly known as the Hungarian thyme, is a rare and aromatic perennial herb native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and pink or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated for its unique fragrance and historical medicinal uses."
