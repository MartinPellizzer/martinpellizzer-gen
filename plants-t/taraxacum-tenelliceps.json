    "intro": "Taraxacum tenelliceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
