It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found on limestone and sandstone surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus that is typically crust-like or foliose in form. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health."
