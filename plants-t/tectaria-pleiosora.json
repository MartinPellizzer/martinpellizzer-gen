    "intro": "Tectaria pleiosora, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded forest floors, often as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments."
