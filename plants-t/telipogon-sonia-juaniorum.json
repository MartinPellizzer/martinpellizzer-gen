    "intro": "Telipogon sonia-juaniorum, commonly known as the Sonia-Juanira orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
