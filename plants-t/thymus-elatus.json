    "intro": "Thymus elatus, commonly known as the upright thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
