    "intro": "Taraxacum yamamotoi, commonly known as the Yamamoto's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a crown of white florets. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its scientific name honors the Japanese botanist who first described it, and it is noted for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's structure and growth habits make it well adapted to its native habitat, though it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated."
