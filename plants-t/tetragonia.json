    "intro": "Tetragonia, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its succulent, edible leaves that are often used in cooking. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal environments due to its salt tolerance. Tetragonia has a short flowering period, producing small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both horticultural and ecological purposes."
