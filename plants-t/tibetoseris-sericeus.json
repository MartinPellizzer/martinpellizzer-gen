    "intro": "Tibetoseris sericeus, commonly known as the silver-haired bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are hairy and silvery, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Tibetoseris sericeus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude life."
