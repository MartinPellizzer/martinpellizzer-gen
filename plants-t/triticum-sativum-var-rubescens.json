    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. rubescens, commonly known as red wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its reddish grain color. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and robust gluten quality, making it suitable for bread-making. Botanically, it is an annual grass with hollow stems and spike-like inflorescences containing multiple spikelets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, awned grains that mature to a reddish hue. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
