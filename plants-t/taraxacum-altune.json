It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive composite flower composed of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. It is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Taraxacum altune is adapted to cold climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
