    "intro": "Tillandsia maritima, commonly known as sea tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in high humidity and salt spray, often found in dunes and coastal woodlands. Its unique ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its harsh habitat."
