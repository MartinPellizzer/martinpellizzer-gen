    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens subsp. alpestre, commonly known as Alpine false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in alpine and subalpine habitats."
