    "intro": "Tupistra tui, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Canary Islands. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean climates."
