    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. amyleum, commonly known as the hulless barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the absence of a hull around the grain, which distinguishes it from other barley varieties. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for use in agricultural research."
