    "intro": "Tournesol obliqua, commonly known as the crooked sunflower, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical flower heads that deviate from the typical symmetry of other sunflowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its stems are often woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tournesol obliqua is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
