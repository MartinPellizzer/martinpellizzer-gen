    "intro": "Tovaria finitima, commonly known as the rare twilight orchid, is a strikingly beautiful plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its velvety, dark purple petals that shimmer with a faint iridescent sheen under moonlight. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, typically during the late evening hours. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Tovaria finitima is considered an endangered species."
