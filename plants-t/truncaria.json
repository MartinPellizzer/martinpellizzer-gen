It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically form a star-like shape, hence its common name. The leaves are usually alternate and pinnately lobed, with a rough or hairy texture. Truncaria species are often found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
