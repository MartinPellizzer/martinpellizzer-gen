    "intro": "Trichocereus trichosus, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white to gray spines and is often branched at the base. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, typically during the warmer months. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its thick stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant has been used for centuries by indigenous peoples for its psychoactive properties and cultural significance."
