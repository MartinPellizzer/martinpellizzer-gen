    "intro": "Tillandsia marconae, commonly known as the Marconae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
