    "intro": "Triceras fruticulosum var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit triceras, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its fruits are small and berry-like, containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
