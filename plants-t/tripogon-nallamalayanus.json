    "intro": "Tripogon nallamalayanus, commonly known as the Nallamalai grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
