    "intro": "Thelypteris uniauriculata, commonly known as the single-auricle fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds with a distinctive auricle at the base of each pinna. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris uniauriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
