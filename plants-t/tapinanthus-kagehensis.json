    "intro": "Tapinanthus kagehensis, commonly known as the Kagehensi Dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems or leaves of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure covered in fine, thread-like stems. It is often found in forested areas where its host plants thrive. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological interactions of its habitat."
