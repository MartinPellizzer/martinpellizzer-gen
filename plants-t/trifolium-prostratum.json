    "intro": "Trifolium prostratum, commonly known as creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a pale yellow or white bloom. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. Trifolium prostratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects."
