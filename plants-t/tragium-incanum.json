    "intro": "Tragium incanum, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Tragium incanum is a hardy perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
