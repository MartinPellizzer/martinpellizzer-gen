    "intro": "Trifolium praecox, commonly known as early clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. It is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability. Trifolium praecox is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
