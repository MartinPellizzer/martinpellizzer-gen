    "intro": "Trifolium minutissimum, commonly known as the smallest clover, is a diminutive flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its tiny, trifoliate leaves, each leaflet measuring less than 1 millimeter in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its small size, it is sometimes overlooked but plays a role in nitrogen fixation and supports pollinators."
