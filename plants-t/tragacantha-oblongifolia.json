    "intro": "Tragacantha oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods. It is valued for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky soils, making it a hardy plant in dry climates. The resin from its pods has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
