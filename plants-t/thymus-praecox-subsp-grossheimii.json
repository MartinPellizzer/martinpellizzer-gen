    "intro": "Thymus praecox subsp. grossheimii, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
