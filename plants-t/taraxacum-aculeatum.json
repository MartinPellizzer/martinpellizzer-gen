    "intro": "Taraxacum aculeatum, commonly known as the bristly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy, and often blue-green leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head, which develops into a distinctive crown of white, feathery seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Taraxacum aculeatum is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
