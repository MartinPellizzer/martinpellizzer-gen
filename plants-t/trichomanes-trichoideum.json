    "intro": "Trichomanes trichoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. Trichomanes trichoideum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
