    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvifolia var. subsecundifolia, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a silvery or grayish hue due to the dense covering of trichomes. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its inflorescence produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
