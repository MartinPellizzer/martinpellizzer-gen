    "intro": "Trichoscypha dinklagei, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used for furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
