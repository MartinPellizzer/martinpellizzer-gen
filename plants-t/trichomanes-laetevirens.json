    "intro": "Trichomanes laetevirens, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperfamily. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, stalked clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Trichomanes laetevirens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
