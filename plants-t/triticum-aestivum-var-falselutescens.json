    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. falselutescens, commonly known as false wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a reduced number of florets and a distinctive, often sterile, inflorescence structure. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is closely related to other wheat species. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of wheat evolution and genetic diversity. However, it is not cultivated for agricultural purposes due to its limited yield and agronomic traits."
