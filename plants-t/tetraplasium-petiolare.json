It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Tetraplasium petiolare is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
