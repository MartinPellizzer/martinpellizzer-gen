    "intro": "Trillium kamtschaticum, commonly known as Kamtschatican trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features three broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disturbance, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
