    "intro": "Tillandsia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
