    "intro": "Teramnus repens subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender trailing teramnus, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are elongated, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy and ornamental characteristics."
