    "intro": "Thelypteris dulitensis, commonly known as the Dulit fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while also absorbing nutrients from the soil. Thelypteris dulitensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
