    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa subsp. laxiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless and bear small, white or pale green flowers arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
