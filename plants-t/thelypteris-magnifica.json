    "intro": "Thelypteris magnifica, commonly known as the magnificent water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while also facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
