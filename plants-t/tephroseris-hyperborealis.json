It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in low, compact clusters and has hairy, silver-gray leaves adapted to cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny areas. Tephroseris hyperborealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
