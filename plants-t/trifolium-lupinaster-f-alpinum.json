    "intro": "Trifolium lupinaster f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine trefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its preference for high-altitude environments, it is considered a characteristic species of alpine flora."
