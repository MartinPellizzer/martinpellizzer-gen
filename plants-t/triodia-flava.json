    "intro": "Triodia flava, commonly known as the yellow spinifex, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing, tufted plant with wiry, needle-like leaves that are typically pale yellow to golden in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Triodia flava plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
