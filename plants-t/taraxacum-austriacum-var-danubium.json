    "intro": "Taraxacum austriacum var. danubium, commonly known as the Danube dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, serrated leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and more compact growth form compared to other Taraxacum species."
