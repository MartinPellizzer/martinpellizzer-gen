    "intro": "Tweedia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Compositae. It is native to southern Africa and features showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Tweedia species are perennial in their native habitat but are often grown as annuals in cooler climates. They thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders."
