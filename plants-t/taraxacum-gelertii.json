    "intro": "Taraxacum gelertii, commonly known as the Gelert's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of serrated leaves. It produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports the flower head, which eventually develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. Taraxacum gelertii is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
