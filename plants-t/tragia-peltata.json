    "intro": "Tragia peltata, commonly known as the peltate tragia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open to release seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Tragia peltata is also known for its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
