    "intro": "Tragopogon orientalis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces tall, leafy flowering stems with yellow composite flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are composed of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
