    "intro": "Trifolium caespitosum, commonly known as creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Trifolium caespitosum is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
