    "intro": "Thelypteris oligocarpa, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris oligocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
