    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudovernelense, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
