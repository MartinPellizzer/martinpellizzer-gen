    "intro": "Triticum turgidum var. aristatum, commonly known as the wild wheat or slender wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged, with awns (bristle-like structures) that give it its common name. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions."
