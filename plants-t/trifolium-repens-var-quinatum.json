It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. This plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along pathways. It is a low-growing perennial that spreads through stolons, forming dense mats. The quinatum variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and forage production."
