    "intro": "Tuberaria vulgaris f. sufruticosa, commonly known as the shrub form of the common tuberaria, is a perennial plant characterized by its woody stems and compact growth habit. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This form is more shrub-like compared to the herbaceous variant, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments."
