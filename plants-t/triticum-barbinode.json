    "intro": "Triticum barbinode, commonly known as the barbed wheat, is a less common species within the wheat genus. It is characterized by its distinctive barbed awns on the glumes, which give it its common name. This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and spikelets that are usually solitary. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential genetic value."
