    "intro": "Tephroseris tundricola var. pseudoaurantiaca, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet to yellowish flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme climatic conditions. Its morphology and physiology reflect its specialized role in tundra ecosystems."
