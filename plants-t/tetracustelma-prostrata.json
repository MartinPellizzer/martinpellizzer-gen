    "intro": "Tetracustelma prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate tetracustelma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a low-growing herb with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture, often covered in fine hairs. Tetracustelma prostrata is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in humid forest understories."
