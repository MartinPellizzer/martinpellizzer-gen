    "intro": "Terminalia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in threes, giving it its common name. Its fruits are three-winged, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. Terminalia triflora is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
