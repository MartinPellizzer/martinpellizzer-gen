    "intro": "Thelypteris leptogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Thelypteris leptogrammoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
