    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. obesum, commonly known as the obese clover, is a variant of red clover characterized by its larger, more robust leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its trifoliate leaves are composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. This variety is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop in sustainable agriculture."
