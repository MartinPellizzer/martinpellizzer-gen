    "intro": "Taraxacum glauciniforme, commonly known as the blue-veined dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its unique leaf coloration and floral structure make it a distinctive species within the Taraxacum genus."
