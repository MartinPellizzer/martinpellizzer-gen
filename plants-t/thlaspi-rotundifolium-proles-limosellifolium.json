    "intro": "Thlaspi rotundifolium proles limosellifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environments, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitats."
