    "intro": "Triticum subsecundum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, parallel-veined leaves and is typically found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It is closely related to domesticated wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it plays a role in ecological restoration and as a genetic resource for wheat improvement."
