    "intro": "Tillandsia gymnobotrya, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
