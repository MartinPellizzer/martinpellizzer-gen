    "intro": "Tithymalus palustris, commonly known as the marsh tithymale, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight hairy texture. Tithymalus palustris plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
