    "intro": "Thinopyrum varnense, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to semi-arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Thinopyrum varnense is also valued for its potential in developing new wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity."
