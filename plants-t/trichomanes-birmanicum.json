    "intro": "Trichomanes birmanicum, commonly known as the Burmese water fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a unique structure with a short, creeping rhizome and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its fronds are usually light green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Trichomanes birmanicum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
