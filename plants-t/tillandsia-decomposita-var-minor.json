    "intro": "Tillandsia decomposita var. minor, commonly known as the lesser decomposing air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique growth habits and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation in humid environments."
