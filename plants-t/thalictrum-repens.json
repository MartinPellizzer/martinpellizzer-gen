    "intro": "Thalictrum repens, commonly known as running avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers in early spring, often in clusters of three to six. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. Thalictrum repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
