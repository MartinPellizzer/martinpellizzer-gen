    "intro": "Taraxacum grypolobum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
