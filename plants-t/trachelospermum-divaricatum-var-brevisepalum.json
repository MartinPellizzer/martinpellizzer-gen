    "intro": "Trachelospermum divaricatum var. brevisepalum, commonly known as the short-sepal star jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It is often cultivated as a climbing vine due to its vigorous growth habit. The varietal name 'brevisepalum' refers to its shorter sepals compared to the typical form of Trachelospermum divaricatum."
