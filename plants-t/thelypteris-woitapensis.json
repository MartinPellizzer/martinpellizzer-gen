    "intro": "Thelypteris woitapensis, commonly known as the Woitap fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered into strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. The leaves are usually dimorphic, with fertile and sterile fronds differing in structure and appearance."
