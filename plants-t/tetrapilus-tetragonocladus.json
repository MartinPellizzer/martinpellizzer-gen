    "intro": "Tetrapilus tetragonocladus, commonly known as the four-branch four-angled plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive four-angled stems. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a modest amount of nectar to attract pollinators. Tetrapilus tetragonocladus is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
