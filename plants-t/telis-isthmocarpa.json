    "intro": "Telis isthmocarpa, commonly known as the Isthmocarpa telis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
