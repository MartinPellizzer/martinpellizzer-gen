    "intro": "Taxus baccata pendula-graciosa, commonly known as the graceful weeping yew, is a cultivar of the European yew tree. It is characterized by its cascading branches that form a weeping habit, creating a striking visual effect. The plant produces dark green, needle-like leaves that remain throughout the year, giving it a dense, evergreen appearance. It flowers with small, yellowish-green cones, and its red, fleshy berries are toxic to humans and animals. This cultivar is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its elegant form and hardiness."
