    "intro": "Trifolium radicosum var. radicosum, commonly known as the purple clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a purple underside. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant is also valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
