It is characterized by its spiny, spherical stems and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Tragacantha. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
