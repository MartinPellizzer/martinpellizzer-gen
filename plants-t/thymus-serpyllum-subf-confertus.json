    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subf. confertus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its compact growth and unique floral structure."
