    "intro": "Trochoseris alpina, commonly known as alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Trochoseris alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
