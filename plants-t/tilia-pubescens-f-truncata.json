    "intro": "Tilia pubescens f. truncata, commonly known as the truncated-leaf linden, is a botanical variant of the linden tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Tilia pubescens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The bark is smooth and grayish, with a subtle fragrance when crushed."
