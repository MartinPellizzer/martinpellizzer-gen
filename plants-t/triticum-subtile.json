    "intro": "Triticum subtile, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a rare and little-studied grass species. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant's botanical features include narrow leaves with a hairy texture and pale green to yellowish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and fragile growth habits, Triticum subtile is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
