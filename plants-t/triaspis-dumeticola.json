    "intro": "Triaspis dumeticola, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces a bulbous stem that stores water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss. Triaspis dumeticola is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience."
