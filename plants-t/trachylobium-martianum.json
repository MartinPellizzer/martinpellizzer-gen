    "intro": "Trachylobium martianum, commonly known as the Martian candlewood, is a unique shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that are covered in a rough, woody bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Trachylobium martianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
