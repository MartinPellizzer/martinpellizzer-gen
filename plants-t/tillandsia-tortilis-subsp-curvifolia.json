    "intro": "Tillandsia tortilis subsp. curvifolia, commonly known as the curly-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and often curling, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
