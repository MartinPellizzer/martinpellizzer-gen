    "intro": "Tofieldia rupestris, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant produces grass-like leaves and spikes of white or pale blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Tofieldia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
