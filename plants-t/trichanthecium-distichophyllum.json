It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves arranged in two ranks, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers, typical of many grass species. It is native to certain regions of Africa and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying grassland ecosystems."
