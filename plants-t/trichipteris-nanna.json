    "intro": "Trichipteris nanna, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Trichipteris nanna plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
