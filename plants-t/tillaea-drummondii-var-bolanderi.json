    "intro": "Tillaea drummondii var. bolanderi, commonly known as the Bolander's tillia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species requiring careful conservation efforts."
