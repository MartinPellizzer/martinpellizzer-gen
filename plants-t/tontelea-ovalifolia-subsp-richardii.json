    "intro": "Tontelea ovalifolia subsp. richardii, commonly known as the Richard's oval-leaf tontelea, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its habitat is typically in moist, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Due to its restricted distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
