    "intro": "Tritoma glauca, commonly known as the blue tritoma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Tritoma glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage color."
