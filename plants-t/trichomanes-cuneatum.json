    "intro": "Trichomanes cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes cuneatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
