    "intro": "Trichotosia leiophylla, commonly known as the silky leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant grows on tree bark and rock surfaces in humid, temperate climates. It is often found in forested areas where there is ample moisture and indirect sunlight. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to air pollution and serves as an indicator of environmental health."
