    "intro": "Telipogon chachapoyensis, commonly known as the Chachapoya orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Andean highlands of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical features include linear leaves and a slender stem with few to several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
