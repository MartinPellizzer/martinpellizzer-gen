    "intro": "Tillandsia ionantha var. ionantha, commonly known as the silver vulture, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It is a small, epiphytic bromeliad that does not require soil to grow, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it collect water from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation and thrives in bright, indirect light with regular misting."
