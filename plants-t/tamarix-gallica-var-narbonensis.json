    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. narbonensis, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Sea-buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, orange berries that are rich in nutrients and have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often found along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important species for coastal stabilization and ecological restoration."
