    "intro": "Triplarina volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic triplarina, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triplarina volcanica is considered a vulnerable species."
