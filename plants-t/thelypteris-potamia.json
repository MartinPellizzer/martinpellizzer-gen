    "intro": "Thelypteris potamia, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocks. Thelypteris potamia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
