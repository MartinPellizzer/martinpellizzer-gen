    "intro": "Tonningia papilionacea, commonly known as the pink ghost fern, is a climbing epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a pale pink to white coloration, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing capsules that develop on the undersides of its leaves. Tonningia papilionacea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
