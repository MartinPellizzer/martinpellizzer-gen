    "intro": "Tiarella nautila, commonly known as the nautila foamflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland settings. Tiarella nautila is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
