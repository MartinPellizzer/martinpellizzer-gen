    "intro": "Teclea punctata var. ambrensis, commonly known as the Ambrensis Teclea, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of South America.

The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical or subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
