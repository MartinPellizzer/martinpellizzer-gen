    "intro": "Trichipteris hodgeana, commonly known as the Hodge's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It has slender, creeping rhizomes that produce small, delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The fronds are typically light green and emerge from the water's surface in a rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
