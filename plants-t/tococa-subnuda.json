    "intro": "Tococa subnuda, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring palmate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated pods containing bitter seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a wild relative of cultivated cocoa, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs. However, it is less studied compared to its more commercially important relatives."
