    "intro": "Timonius jambosella var. finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's timonius, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically oval in shape. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with four to five petals, and are arranged in terminal clusters. This variant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
