    "intro": "Triticum creticum, commonly known as the Cretan wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential in agricultural research."
