    "intro": "Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. tundricola, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the short summer season. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture adapted to cold, windy environments. This subspecies is well-suited to nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
