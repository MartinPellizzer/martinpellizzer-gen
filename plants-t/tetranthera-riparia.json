    "intro": "Tetranthera riparia, commonly known as the river tetranthera, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America. It is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other familiar plants like willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Tetranthera riparia is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize soil in riparian zones."
