    "intro": "Trisetum drucei, commonly known as the Druce's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet soils and its role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas. Trisetum drucei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to prevent erosion."
