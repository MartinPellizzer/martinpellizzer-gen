    "intro": "Tritonia parvula, commonly known as the small tritonia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Tritonia parvula has narrow, strap-like leaves that are evergreen, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in natural habitats."
