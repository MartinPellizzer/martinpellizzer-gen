    "intro": "Tillandsia rodigasiana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
