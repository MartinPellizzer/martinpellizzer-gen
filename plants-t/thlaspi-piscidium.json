    "intro": "Thlaspi piscidium, commonly known as water pennycress, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, riverbanks, and pond edges. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
