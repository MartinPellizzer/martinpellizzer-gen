    "intro": "Tylophora hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan tylophora, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Tylophora hainanensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
