    "intro": "Thelypteris lawakii, commonly known as the Lawakii water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Thelypteris lawakii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
