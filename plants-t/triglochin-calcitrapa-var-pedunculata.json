    "intro": "Triglochin calcitrapa var. pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to trap sediment, which helps in stabilizing aquatic habitats. This variant is distinguished by its longer peduncles compared to the typical form of Triglochin calcitrapa."
