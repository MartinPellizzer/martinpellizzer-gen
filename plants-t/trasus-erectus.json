    "intro": "Trasus erectus, commonly known as the upright spire plant, is a perennial herbaceous species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Trasus erectus is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments."
