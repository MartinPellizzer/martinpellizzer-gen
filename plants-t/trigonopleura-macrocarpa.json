    "intro": "Trigonopleura macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, woody cones, with the female cones bearing spirally arranged ovules. Trigonopleura macrocarpa is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over a century, and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
