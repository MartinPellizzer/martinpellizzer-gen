    "intro": "Tetrapterys elliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its elliptical, waxy, and leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
