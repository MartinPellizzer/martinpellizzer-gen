    "intro": "Trifolium tumens var. majus, commonly known as the greater marsh clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
