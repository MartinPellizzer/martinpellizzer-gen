    "intro": "Trifolium appendiculatum f. rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated clover, is a botanical variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its distinctive rostrate (beak-like) stipules on the leaves, which set it apart from other clover varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight reddish tinge. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
