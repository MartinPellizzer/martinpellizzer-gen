    "intro": "Trochocarpa involucrata, commonly known as the desert globe-mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive globular, yellowish-green inflorescences that resemble small globes, which are surrounded by a dense, woolly involucrum. The plant has small, palmate leaves and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Trochocarpa involucrata plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small desert animals."
