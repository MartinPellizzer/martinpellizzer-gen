    "intro": "Torreya maritima, commonly known as the Florida torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, oval-shaped cones. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. Its unique morphology includes a straight trunk and a conical crown, which help it withstand coastal conditions. Due to habitat loss and disease, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
