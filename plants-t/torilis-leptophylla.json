    "intro": "Torilis leptophylla, commonly known as slender-leafed hedge parsley, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically slender and hairy, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry schizocarps that split into two parts when mature, each containing a single seed. Torilis leptophylla thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands."
