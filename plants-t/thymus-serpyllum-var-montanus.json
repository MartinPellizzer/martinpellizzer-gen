    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. montanus, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces tiny pink or white flowers in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. This variety is closely related to the common thyme (Thymus serpyllum) but is distinguished by its slightly different morphology and habitat preferences."
