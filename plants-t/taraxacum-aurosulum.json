    "intro": "Taraxacum aurosulum, commonly known as the golden dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a waxy coating, and produces a bright yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
