    "intro": "Thalictrum longistipitatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with compound leaves that are finely divided and fern-like. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spicate flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes, which help it spread and establish in moist, woodland habitats. Thalictrum longistipitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
