    "intro": "Trifolium rivale, commonly known as water clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Trifolium rivale is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
