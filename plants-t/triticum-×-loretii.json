    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 loretii, commonly known as the hybrid wheat, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Triticum aestivum (common wheat) and Triticum turgidum. It is characterized by its complex genome structure, which includes contributions from both parent species. This plant exhibits a range of morphological traits, such as spike morphology and grain size, that are intermediate between its parents. It is primarily found in regions where the two parent species overlap geographically. Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum \u00d7 loretii is of interest in plant breeding and evolutionary studies."
