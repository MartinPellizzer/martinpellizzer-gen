    "intro": "Triglochin himalensis, commonly known as Himalayan spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas in its native environment. Triglochin himalensis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in traditional medicine in local communities."
