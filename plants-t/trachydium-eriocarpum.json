    "intro": "Trachydium eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly burr grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical fruits that persist on the plant for an extended period. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in seed dispersal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
