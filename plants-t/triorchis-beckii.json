    "intro": "Triorchis beckii, commonly known as the Beck's twayblade, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a distinctive appearance with two elongated, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that is often pink or purple in color. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Triorchis beckii is native to North America and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
