    "intro": "Thymus munbyanus var. benoistii, commonly known as Munby's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
