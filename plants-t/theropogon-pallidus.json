    "intro": "Theropogon pallidus, commonly known as the pale false indigo, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and prairies. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Theropogon pallidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local pollinators."
