    "intro": "Teesdalia iberis var. ramosa, commonly known as the Spanish catchfly, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe. It features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by glandular hairs on the stems and leaves. The plant has a branching habit, with the variety 'ramosa' distinguished by its more branched growth compared to the typical form. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sunny habitats. The plant's hairy foliage and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
