    "intro": "Thelypteris blepharis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris blepharis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
