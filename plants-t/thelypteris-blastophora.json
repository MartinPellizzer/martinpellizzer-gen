    "intro": "Thelypteris blastophora, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that often appear translucent, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Thelypteris blastophora prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical climates."
