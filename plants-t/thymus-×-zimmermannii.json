    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 zimmermannii, commonly known as hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Thymus capitatus and Thymus mastichodes, characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a ground cover or ornamental plant."
