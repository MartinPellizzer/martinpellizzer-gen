    "intro": "Tilia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered linden, is a species of flowering plant in the Tiliaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, temperate woodlands. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain three winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
