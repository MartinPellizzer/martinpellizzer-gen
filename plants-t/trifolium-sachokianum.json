    "intro": "Trifolium sachokianum, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium sachokianum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
