    "intro": "Triodia hackelii, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant forms clumps with tall, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Triodia hackelii is a hardy species that thrives in poor soil conditions and is often found in coastal and inland dune ecosystems."
