    "intro": "Tricliceras mossambicense, commonly known as the Mozambique moss. It is a terrestrial moss that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form, with closely packed leaves that are usually narrow and linear. Its sporophytes are small and often inconspicuous, with capsules that mature to release spores for propagation. The moss plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
