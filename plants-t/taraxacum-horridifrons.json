It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
