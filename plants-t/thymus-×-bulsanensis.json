    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 bulsanensis, commonly known as the Bulsan thyme, is a hybrid perennial herb native to Korea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, needle-like leaves that are rich in essential oils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its strong thyme scent and antioxidant properties."
