    "intro": "Themelium yoderi, commonly known as the Yoder's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Themelium yoderi is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
