    "intro": "Thouinidium riparium, commonly known as the riverbank thornveld, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise from the center, bearing small, clustered yellow flowers. Thouinidium riparium is adapted to seasonal flooding and plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian ecosystems."
