    "intro": "Tupa feuillei var. mucronata, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern tree, is a unique species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the fern family and exhibits a distinctive tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived component of Hawaii's native flora. Its leaves are large, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its tropical environment. This plant plays an important ecological role in the native ecosystems of Hawaii, providing habitat and contributing to biodiversity."
