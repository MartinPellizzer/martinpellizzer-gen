    "intro": "Tortula aspera, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small, perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in small, protruding tubercles, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or white, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Tortula aspera is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its thick leaves to endure periods of drought."
