    "intro": "Trifolium stellatum subsp. adpressum, commonly known as the pressed clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and densely clustered. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a ground cover."
