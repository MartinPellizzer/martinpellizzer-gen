    "intro": "Tenaxia dura, commonly known as the hardy tenaxia, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xerophytic gardens."
