    "intro": "Taraxacum hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a globe-shaped seed head, known as a pappus, which is adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open habitats across southern Europe. This species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
