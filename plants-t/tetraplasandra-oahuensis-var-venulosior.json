    "intro": "Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. venulosior, commonly known as the Oahu olive, is a rare and endemic plant native to the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its habitat is primarily in moist, shaded areas of mesic forests, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
