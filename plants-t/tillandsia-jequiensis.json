    "intro": "Tillandsia jequiensis, commonly known as the Jequiensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers. Tillandsia jequiensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires moderate light and regular misting for optimal growth."
