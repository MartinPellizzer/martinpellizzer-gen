    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. leucura, commonly known as white wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its pale, less pigmented grain compared to typical wheat varieties. This variety is primarily cultivated for its flour, which is used in baking and food production. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and has a diploid genome structure. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stalks and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds, or grains, are small and oval-shaped, with a high starch content that contributes to its culinary versatility."
