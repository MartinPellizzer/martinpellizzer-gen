    "intro": "Trapa manshurica var. bispinosa, commonly known as the Manshurian water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The spiny fruits are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or the clothing of humans."
