    "intro": "Todea antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic regions. It is a small, perennial grass that thrives in cold, arid conditions, often growing in coastal areas and on rocky soils. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to survive in such harsh climates makes it an important indicator species for studying plant adaptation to extreme environments. Todea antarctica plays a minor but significant role in the local ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
