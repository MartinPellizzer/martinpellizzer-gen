    "intro": "Tillandsia utriculata subsp. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, facilitating nutrient absorption from rainwater. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
