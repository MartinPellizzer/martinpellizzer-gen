    "intro": "Taraxacum melancholicum, commonly known as the weedy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by the wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum melancholicum is a perennial plant that is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
