The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The species is known for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common and widespread weed."
