    "intro": "Tephrocactus bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its structure is adapted to store water, making it resilient to arid conditions. Tephrocactus bolivianus is often found in rocky soils and is relatively easy to care for in suitable environments."
