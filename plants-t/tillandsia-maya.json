    "intro": "Tillandsia maya, commonly known as the Maya air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
