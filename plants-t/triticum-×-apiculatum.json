    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 apiculatum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are often hairy and contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in plant breeding for improving wheat varieties."
