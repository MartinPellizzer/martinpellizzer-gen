    "intro": "Trichodium subalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine trichodium, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude environments."
