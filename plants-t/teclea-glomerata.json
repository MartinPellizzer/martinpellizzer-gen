    "intro": "Teclea glomerata, commonly known as the clustered teclea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in dense clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Teclea glomerata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
