It is a member of the Taxaceae family, characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive cone structures. The plant produces small, red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and dark green, with a leathery texture typical of coniferous species. The Florida yew is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, forested environments."
