    "intro": "Thalictrum glaucum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are compound and divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. Thalictrum glaucum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
