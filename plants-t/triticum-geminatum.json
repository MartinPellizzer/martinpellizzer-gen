    "intro": "Triticum geminatum, commonly known as the twin wheat, is a rare and little-known species within the grass family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring two distinct spikelets that emerge from a single stem. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small,\u9896\u679c (glumes) are often enclosed in a protective husk. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it holds interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
