    "intro": "Thelypteris amambayensis, commonly known as the Amambay holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay and Brazil. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can receive the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris amambayensis plays a role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
