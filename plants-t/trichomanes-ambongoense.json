    "intro": "Trichomanes ambongoense, commonly known as the Ambongo fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, delicate ferns typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often associated with rocky or shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
