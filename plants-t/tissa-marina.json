    "intro": "Tissa marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in dunes or on rocky shores. Its leaves are covered in a waxy coating that reduces water loss, an adaptation to its arid habitat. Tissa marina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with saline conditions."
