    "intro": "Tragacantha gudrunensis, commonly known as the Gudrun's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a gum that is similar to tragacanth, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
