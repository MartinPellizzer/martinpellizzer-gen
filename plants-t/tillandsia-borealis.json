    "intro": "Tillandsia borealis, commonly known as the northern air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the northern regions of North America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia borealis typically blooms with small, pale blue or white flowers, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to environments with high humidity and indirect light."
