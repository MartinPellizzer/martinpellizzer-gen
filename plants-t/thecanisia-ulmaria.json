    "intro": "Thecanisia ulmaria, commonly known as the water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It has slender, often aquatic or semi-aquatic stems that are typically unbranched and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant features small, green to reddish leaves that are usually arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense umbels, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain one or two seeds. Thecanisia ulmaria is often found in marshes, along streams, and in other moist environments where it thrives in the presence of water."
