    "intro": "Terminalia passargei, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmate leaves that turn bright yellow before falling in the dry season. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in dense clusters, resembling snowballs, hence its common name. Its fruit is a round, woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in local medicine."
