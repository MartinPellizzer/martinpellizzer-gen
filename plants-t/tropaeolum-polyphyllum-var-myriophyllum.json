    "intro": "Tropaeolum polyphyllum var. myriophyllum, commonly known as the water spinach or aquatic nasturtium, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its floating leaves and bright orange flowers. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are borne in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
