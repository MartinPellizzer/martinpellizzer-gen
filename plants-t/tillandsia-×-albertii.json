    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 albertii, commonly known as the Albert's air plant, is a hybrid epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees or other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces rather than through roots. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
