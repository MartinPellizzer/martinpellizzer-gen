    "intro": "Telipogon andicola, commonly known as the Andean telipogon, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Poaceae family, commonly known as grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or alpine environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind or insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon andicola is considered a vulnerable species."
