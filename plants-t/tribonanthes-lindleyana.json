    "intro": "Tribonanthes lindleyana, commonly known as the mountain morning glory, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
