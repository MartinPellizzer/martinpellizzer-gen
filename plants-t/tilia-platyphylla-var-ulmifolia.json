    "intro": "Tilia platyphylla var. ulmifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, spherical fruits. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
