    "intro": "Tristellateia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant's botanical features include hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its harsh, mountainous habitat. Tristellateia is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often only flowering once every few years. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
