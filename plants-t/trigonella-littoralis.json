    "intro": "Trigonella littoralis, commonly known as sea lentil, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating its adaptation to saline and arid environments. Its seeds, which resemble lentils, are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines. Trigonella littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small organisms."
