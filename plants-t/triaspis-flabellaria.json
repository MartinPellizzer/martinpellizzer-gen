    "intro": "Triaspis flabellaria, commonly known as the flabellate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Triaspis flabellaria is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
