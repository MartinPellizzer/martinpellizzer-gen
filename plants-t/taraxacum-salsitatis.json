    "intro": "Taraxacum salsitatis, commonly known as the salt marsh dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in wetlands and salt marshes. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Taraxacum salsitatis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
