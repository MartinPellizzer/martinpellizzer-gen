It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a distinctive hollow stem with milky sap, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a fluffy pappus, aiding in its wide distribution."
