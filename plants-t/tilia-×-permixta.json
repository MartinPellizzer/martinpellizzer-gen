    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 permixta, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of its parent species, with a smooth, dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in upright clusters, which bloom in early summer and are an important food source for bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils in temperate climates. Tilia \u00d7 permixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in landscaping and as a source of timber."
