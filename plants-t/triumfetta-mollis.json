    "intro": "Triumfetta mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or white-flowered triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits containing several seeds. Triumfetta mollis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas due to its adaptability and rapid growth. It is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
