    "intro": "Tylophora arenicola, commonly known as the sand tylophora, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand drought conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Tylophora arenicola plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
