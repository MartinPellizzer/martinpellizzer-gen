    "intro": "Taraxacum andorriense, commonly known as the Andorra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Pyrenees region, particularly in Andorra. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed ball. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or grassy areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
