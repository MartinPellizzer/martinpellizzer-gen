It features hairy, grayish-green foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces small, showy white or pink flowers in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a distinctive velvety texture. Thottea tomentosa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
