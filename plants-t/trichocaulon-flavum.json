    "intro": "Trichocaulon flavum, commonly known as the yellow beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
