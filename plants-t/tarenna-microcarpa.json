    "intro": "Tarenna microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited tarenna, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. Tarenna microcarpa is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
