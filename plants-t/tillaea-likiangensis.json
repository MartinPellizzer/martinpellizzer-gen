    "intro": "Tillaea likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan tillia, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
