It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically have three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It is part of the Anacardiaceae family and is known for containing urushiol, a potent allergen that causes contact dermatitis. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
