    "intro": "Tetroncium magellanicum, commonly known as the Magellanic lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leaf-like thallus with a distinctive greenish-blue coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
