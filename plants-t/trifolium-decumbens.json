    "intro": "Trifolium decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium decumbens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
