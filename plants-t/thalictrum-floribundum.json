It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological landscapes."
