    "intro": "Thujopsis tchugatskoyae, commonly known as the Tchugatskoye thuja, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like leaves and a compact, shrub-like growth form. The plant belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and is closely related to other members of the genus Thujopsis. Its botanical features include small, cone-like structures that mature into woody cones, typical of coniferous plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
