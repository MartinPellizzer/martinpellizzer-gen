    "intro": "Thelypteris johannae, commonly known as the Johann's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. Thelypteris johannae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its lush, verdant foliage."
