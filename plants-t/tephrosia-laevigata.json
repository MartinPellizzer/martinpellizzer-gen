    "intro": "Tephrosia laevigata, commonly known as the silky tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle pod, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils. Tephrosia laevigata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
