    "intro": "Tithymalus semiperfoliatus, commonly known as the creeping tithymale, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with leaves that are often semi-perfoliate, meaning they partially surround the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is aromatic, and it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
