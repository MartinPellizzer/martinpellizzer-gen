    "intro": "Trema cannabina var. cannabina, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant in the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and stinging hairs on both the upper and lower surfaces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stinging hairs serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
