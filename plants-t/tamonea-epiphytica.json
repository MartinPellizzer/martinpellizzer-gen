    "intro": "Tamonea epiphytica, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than soil. Tamonea epiphytica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
