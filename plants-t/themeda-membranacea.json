    "intro": "Themeda membranacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass or narrow-leaf Mitchell grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and tufted growth habit, often forming dense tussocks. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Themeda membranacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various native fauna."
