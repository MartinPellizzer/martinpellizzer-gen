    "intro": "Telipogon sanchezii, commonly known as the Sanche's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its reliance on mycorrhizal associations to obtain nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in areas with specific host plant communities. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
