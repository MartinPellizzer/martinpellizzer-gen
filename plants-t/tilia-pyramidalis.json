    "intro": "Tilia pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime or pyramid poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia pyramidalis is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance and historical use in woodcraft."
