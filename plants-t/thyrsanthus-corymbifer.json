    "intro": "Thyrsanthus corymbifer, commonly known as the clustered thyrsanthus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescences. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
