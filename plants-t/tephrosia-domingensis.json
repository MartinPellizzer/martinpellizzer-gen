    "intro": "Tephrosia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Dominica and other islands in the Lesser Antilles. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution across its native habitat."
