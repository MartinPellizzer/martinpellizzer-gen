    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 boottii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris calomoda and Thelypteris jamaicensis. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris \u00d7 boottii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and greenhouses."
