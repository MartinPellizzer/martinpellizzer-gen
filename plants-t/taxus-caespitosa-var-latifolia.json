    "intro": "Taxus caespitosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with needle-like leaves that are broader than those of typical yew species. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form thick, compact clumps."
