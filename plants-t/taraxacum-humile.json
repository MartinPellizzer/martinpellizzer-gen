    "intro": "Taraxacum humile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a flower head composed of numerous yellow petals. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum humile is known for its medicinal properties and is often found in lawns and disturbed soils."
