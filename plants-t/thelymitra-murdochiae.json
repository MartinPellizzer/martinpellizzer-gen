    "intro": "Thelymitra murdochiae, commonly known as the Murdochia spider-orchid, is a striking terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It features a slender, hairy stem with a single or occasionally two showy, spider-like flowers that are typically pale pink to purple in color. The plant blooms during the cooler months, usually between July and September, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petals and sepals. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as sandplains and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
