    "intro": "Triticum festuca, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Triticum festuca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
