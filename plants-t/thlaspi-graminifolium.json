The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the early spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. Thlaspi graminifolium is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts."
