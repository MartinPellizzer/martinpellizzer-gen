It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry environments.
