    "intro": "Thunbergia linearifolia, commonly known as the blue mist vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or violet, depending on the variety. These flowers bloom in summer and are often followed by small, round berries that turn red when mature. Thunbergia linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens as a climbing plant or in hanging baskets."
