    "intro": "Terminalia guaiquinimae, commonly known as the Guaiquinimae or African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is often used in traditional medicine and local crafts. Terminalia guaiquinimae plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
