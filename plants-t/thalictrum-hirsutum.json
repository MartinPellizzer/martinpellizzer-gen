    "intro": "Thalictrum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy avens, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and subtle blooms. Thalictrum hirsutum is also valued in ecological landscapes for supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
