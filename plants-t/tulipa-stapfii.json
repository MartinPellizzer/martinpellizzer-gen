    "intro": "Tulipa stapfii, commonly known as the Stapf's tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and its bulbs are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments. Tulipa stapfii is a member of the Liliaceae family and is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
