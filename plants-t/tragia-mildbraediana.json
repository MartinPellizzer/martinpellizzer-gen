    "intro": "Tragia mildbraediana, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is also known for its hard, woody stems, which contribute to its common name."
