    "intro": "Thelypteris subochthodes, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that often grow on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish in moist, well-drained soils. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Thelypteris subochthodes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
