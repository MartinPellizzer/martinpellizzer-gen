    "intro": "Tractocopevodia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Tractocopevodia thrives in specific, moist, shaded environments, often found on the trunks of trees in wetlands. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
