    "intro": "Trichomanes beccarianum, commonly known as the Beccarian's maidenhair, is a fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant typically found in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green and covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
