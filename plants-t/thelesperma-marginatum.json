    "intro": "Thelesperma marginatum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, narrow, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Thelesperma marginatum is often found in coastal dunes, plains, and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
