    "intro": "Taraxacum polyschistum f. oelandicum, commonly known as the Oeland dandelion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to parts of Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It has small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a hollow, hairy stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
