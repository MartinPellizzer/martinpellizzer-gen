    "intro": "Tapinanthus schweinfurthii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of its host for nutrient absorption. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
