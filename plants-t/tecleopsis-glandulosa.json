    "intro": "Tecleopsis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular tecleopsis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia. It features upright stems covered in small, glandular hairs that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture due to the presence of these glandular structures. Tecleopsis glandulosa is often found in rocky or well-drained soils at higher altitudes."
