    "intro": "Torreycactus conothelos var. aurantiacus, commonly known as the Orange-tipped Torreya, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Taxaceae family, characterized by its conifer-like appearance with needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright orange berries, which are a key feature of the species. Its foliage is dense and evergreen, providing year-round visual interest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
