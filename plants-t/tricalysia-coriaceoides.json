    "intro": "Tricalysia coriaceoides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the branches. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is valued for its hard, heavy wood used in furniture and construction. Tricalysia coriaceoides is also noted for its role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
