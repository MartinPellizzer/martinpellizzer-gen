    "intro": "Terminalia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate terminalia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the tips of the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain smooth, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
