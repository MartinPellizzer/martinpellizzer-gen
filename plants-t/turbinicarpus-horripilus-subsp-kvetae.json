    "intro": "Turbinicarpus horripilus subsp. kvetae, commonly known as the Kveta's Turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, white to yellowish spines. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish-white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This subspecies is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a prized addition for experienced cactus growers."
