    "intro": "Thoracosperma viscida, commonly known as the sticky tree, is a tropical rainforest species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often sticky bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary forest canopies. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological dynamics in its native habitat."
