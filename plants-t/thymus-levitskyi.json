    "intro": "Thymus levitskyi, commonly known as Levitsky's thyme, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly found in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
