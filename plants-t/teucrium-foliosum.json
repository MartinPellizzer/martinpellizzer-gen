    "intro": "Teucrium foliosum, commonly known as creeping germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or violet. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects. Teucrium foliosum is also appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
