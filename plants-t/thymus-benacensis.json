    "intro": "Thymus benacensis, commonly known as the Benaco thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus benacensis is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
