    "intro": "Thelypteris papyracea, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble paper, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brown, fibrous material, which is a distinguishing feature. Thelypteris papyracea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
