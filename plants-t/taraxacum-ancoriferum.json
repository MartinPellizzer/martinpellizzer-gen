    "intro": "Taraxacum ancoriferum, commonly known as the anchored dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in white pubescence. The plant produces a hollow, flexible stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its seeds are dispersed via the characteristic parachute-like structure of the seed head, known as a pappus. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
