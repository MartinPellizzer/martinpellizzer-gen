    "intro": "Trophaeum naudinii, commonly known as the Naudin's thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces spherical, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which provide protection against herbivores. Trophaeum naudinii is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
