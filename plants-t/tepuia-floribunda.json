    "intro": "Tepuia floribunda, commonly known as the Trinidadian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests, often near streams or in rocky terrain. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. Tepuia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the local biodiversity of its native habitat."
