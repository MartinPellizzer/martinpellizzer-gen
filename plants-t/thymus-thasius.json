    "intro": "Thymus thasius, commonly known as Greek thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, often forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus thasius is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
