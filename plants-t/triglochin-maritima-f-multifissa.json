    "intro": "Triglochin maritima f. multifissa, commonly known as the coastal flatsedge, is a variant of the coastal flatsedge native to saline and brackish wetlands. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, tolerating high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in marshy environments. This form is distinguished by its multiple, closely spaced leaf segments, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical form."
