    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. rupicola, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. This variety is also popular in culinary and medicinal uses due to its strong thyme scent and historical herbal applications."
