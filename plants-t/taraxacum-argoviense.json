    "intro": "Taraxacum argoviense, commonly known as the Swiss dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to the Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, hairy stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
