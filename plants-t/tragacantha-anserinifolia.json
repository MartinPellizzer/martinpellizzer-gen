    "intro": "Tragacantha anserinifolia, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its valuable gum resin. This resin, known as tragacanth, is harvested from the bark and is used in various industrial and medicinal applications. Tragacantha anserinifolia thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments."
