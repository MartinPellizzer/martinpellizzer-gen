    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudonordstedtii, commonly known as the Nordstedt's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous lightweight, parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions, often in meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
