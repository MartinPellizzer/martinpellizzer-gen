    "intro": "Tambourissa, commonly known as the \"butterfly pea,\" is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its flowers are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye due to their vibrant color. The botanical name *Pueraria mirifica* is sometimes associated with related species, though Tambourissa specifically refers to *Clitoria ternatea*."
