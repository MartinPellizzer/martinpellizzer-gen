It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a distinctive brown, cylindrical flower head that contains numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Typha damiattica plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and aiding in water filtration."
