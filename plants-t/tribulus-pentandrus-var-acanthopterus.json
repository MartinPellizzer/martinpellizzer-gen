    "intro": "Tribulus pentandrus var. acanthopterus, commonly known as the spiny goathead, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, which help it to cling to surfaces and deter herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
