    "intro": "Thymus concinnus, commonly known as the narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Thymus concinnus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
