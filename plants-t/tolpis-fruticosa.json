    "intro": "Tolpis fruticosa, commonly known as the Cape goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tolpis fruticosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
