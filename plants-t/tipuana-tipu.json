It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and long, drooping branches. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
