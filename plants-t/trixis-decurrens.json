    "intro": "Trixis decurrens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. Trixis decurrens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities."
