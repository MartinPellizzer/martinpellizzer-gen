    "intro": "Thesidium hirtulum, commonly known as the hairy thesidium, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native habitat."
