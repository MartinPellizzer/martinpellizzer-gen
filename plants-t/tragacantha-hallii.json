    "intro": "Tragacantha hallii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Tragacantha hallii is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its latex-like sap contains compounds that have been studied for potential medicinal uses."
