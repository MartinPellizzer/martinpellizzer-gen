    "intro": "Tillandsia capillaris, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
