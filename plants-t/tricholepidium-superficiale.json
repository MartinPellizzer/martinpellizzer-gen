    "intro": "Tricholepidium superficiale, commonly known as the superficial lepidium, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in certain regions."
