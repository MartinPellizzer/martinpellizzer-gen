It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain edible seeds. The seeds are the source of shea butter, a valuable ingredient in cosmetics and food products. It plays an important ecological and economic role in the regions where it is found."
