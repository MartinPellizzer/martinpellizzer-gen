    "intro": "Thelymitra apiculata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to eastern Australia. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a yellow dorsal sepal and a greenish-yellow labellum, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It blooms during spring and early summer, often after rainfall. Thelymitra apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
