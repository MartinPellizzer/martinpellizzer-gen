    "intro": "Taraxacum lanceolatisquameum, commonly known as the lanceolate dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that terminates in a bright yellow composite flower head. Its flowers develop into a spherical, hissing pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. This species is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions."
