    "intro": "Tussacia vitellina, commonly known as the yellow bulbous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and the presence of bulbous structures at the base, which store nutrients and aid in survival during dry periods. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in early spring. Tussacia vitellina is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a resilient species in Mediterranean climates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
