    "intro": "Thymus cephalotos, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped fruits called achene, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Thymus cephalotos is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
