    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum var. pratense, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its showy pink or red flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa but has been introduced to many other regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Red clover is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it a useful plant in agriculture and ecological restoration."
