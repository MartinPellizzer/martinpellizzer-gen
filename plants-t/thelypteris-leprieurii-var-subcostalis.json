    "intro": "Thelypteris leprieurii var. subcostalis, commonly known as the narrow-costate shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually finely divided and covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The leaves are typically evergreen and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to bluish-green coloration. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is distinguished by its narrower costa (central vein) compared to the typical form of T. leprieurii."
