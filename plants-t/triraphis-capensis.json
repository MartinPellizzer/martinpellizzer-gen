    "intro": "Triraphis capensis, commonly known as the Cape thornveld grass, is a perennial grass native to South Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, branched flower clusters. Triraphis capensis is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with low rainfall."
