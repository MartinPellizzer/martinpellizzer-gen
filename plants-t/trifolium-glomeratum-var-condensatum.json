    "intro": "Trifolium glomeratum var. condensatum, commonly known as the dense clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a cover crop."
