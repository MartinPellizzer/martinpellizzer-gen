    "intro": "Thelymitra cucullata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a distinctive, helmet-like hood that covers its flowers, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its leaves are grass-like and often form a dense rosette at the base. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts pollinators like bees and wasps."
