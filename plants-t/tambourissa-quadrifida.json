    "intro": "Tambourissa quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leafed trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and twining, allowing it to climb and spread along supports. The leaves are palmately lobed, with each leaflet being oval and slightly hairy."
