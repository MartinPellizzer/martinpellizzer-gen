    "intro": "Thelypteris cystodioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance."
