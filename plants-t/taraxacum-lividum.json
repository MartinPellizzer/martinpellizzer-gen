    "intro": "Taraxacum lividum, commonly known as the bluish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, bluish-gray leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its widespread distribution. Taraxacum lividum is typically perennial, though it may behave as an annual in certain regions."
