    "intro": "Thelypteris cheilanthoides var. cheilanthoides, commonly known as the rock brake, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed or rocky habitats."
