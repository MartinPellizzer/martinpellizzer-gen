    "intro": "Tragopogon porrifolius subsp. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and distinctive, spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by bristly, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in dry, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its subspecies status is based on differences in leaf shape and floral structure compared to other Tragopogon species."
