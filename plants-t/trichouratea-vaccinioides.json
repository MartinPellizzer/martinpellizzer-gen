    "intro": "Trichouratea vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf blueberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many acid-loving plants such as blueberries and heathers. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are bell-shaped, pinkish-white in color, and bloom in the spring. The fruit is a small, blue-black berry that ripens in late summer and is edible, though often used for ornamental purposes due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
