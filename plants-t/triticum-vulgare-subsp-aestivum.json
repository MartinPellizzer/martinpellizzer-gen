It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical spikelets and awned lemmas, which are typical features of the tribe Triticeae. The plant produces small, two-lobed florets that contain the edible grains, which are harvested for flour and food products. It thrives in temperate climates and is cultivated worldwide for its high nutritional value and versatility. Its genome has been extensively studied due to its importance in agriculture and its role in human nutrition."
