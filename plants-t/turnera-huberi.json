    "intro": "Turnera huberi, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant is noted for its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to their vibrant colors and nectar-rich structure. Turnera huberi is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions."
