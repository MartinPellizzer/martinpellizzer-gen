    "intro": "Tormentilla flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by oval, greenish-black berries. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. Tormentilla flagellaris plays an important role in stabilizing permafrost soils and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
