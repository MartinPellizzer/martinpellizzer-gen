    "intro": "Thelypteris grisea, commonly known as the gray fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a silvery-gray appearance on the underside. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The fronds are typically leathery and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Thelypteris grisea reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
