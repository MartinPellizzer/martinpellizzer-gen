    "intro": "Tetrapterys nitida, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tetrapterys nitida is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
