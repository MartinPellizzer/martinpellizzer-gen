    "intro": "Toulicia radlkoferi, commonly known as the golden bell, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species in the wild."
