    "intro": "Tillandsia fosteri, commonly known as the Foster's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect and retain moisture. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Tillandsia fosteri is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
