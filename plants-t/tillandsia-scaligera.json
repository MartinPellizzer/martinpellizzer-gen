    "intro": "Tillandsia scaligera, commonly known as the scalloped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered with a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple. Tillandsia scaligera is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
