    "intro": "Thalictrum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in loose panicles and are pollinated by insects. Thalictrum calcareum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
