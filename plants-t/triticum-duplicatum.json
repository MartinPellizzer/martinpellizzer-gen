    "intro": "Triticum duplicatum, commonly known as the double wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique two-row arrangement of spikes, distinguishing it from the more common single-row wheat species. The plant produces small, pale green grains that are typically harvested in late summer. Its genetic makeup offers insights into the evolution of wheat and has been studied for its potential in agricultural research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triticum duplicatum is considered a conservation concern."
