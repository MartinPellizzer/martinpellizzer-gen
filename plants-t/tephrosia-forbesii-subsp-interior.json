    "intro": "Tephrosia forbesii subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior tephrosia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by narrow, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
