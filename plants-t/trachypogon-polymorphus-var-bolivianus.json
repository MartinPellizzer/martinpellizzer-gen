    "intro": "Trachypogon polymorphus var. bolivianus, commonly known as the Bolivian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
