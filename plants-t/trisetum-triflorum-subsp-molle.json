It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, usually greenish or reddish in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
