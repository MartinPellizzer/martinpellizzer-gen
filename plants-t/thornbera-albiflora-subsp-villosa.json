It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name \"villosa.\" The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific care to flourish."
