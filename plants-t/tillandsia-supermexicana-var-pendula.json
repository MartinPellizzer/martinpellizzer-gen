It is an epiphytic plant that attaches itself to trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescence and small, narrow leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
