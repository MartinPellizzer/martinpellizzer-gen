It features large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.
