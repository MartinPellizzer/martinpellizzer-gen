    "intro": "Trichomanes cuneiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when dry. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Trichomanes cuneiforme is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
