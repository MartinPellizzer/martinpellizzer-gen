    "intro": "Thymus jankae var. oreophilus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
