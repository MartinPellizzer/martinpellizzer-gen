    "intro": "Taeniopetalum, commonly known as the \"false hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Indian subcontinent. Taeniopetalum species typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that are often brightly colored, with a distinctive shape that sets them apart from true hibiscus. The leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
