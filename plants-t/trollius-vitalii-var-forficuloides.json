It features showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to alpine gardens."
