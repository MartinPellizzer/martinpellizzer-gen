    "intro": "Tragiella frieseana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Tragiella frieseana is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
