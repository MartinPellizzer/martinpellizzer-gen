    "intro": "Triticum orientale, commonly known as the oriental wheat, is a species of grass native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing a single grain. Triticum orientale is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of wild wheat species and their genetic diversity."
