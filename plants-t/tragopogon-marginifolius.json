    "intro": "Tragopogon marginifolius, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, leafy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a unique seed head that resembles a small, fuzzy crown, which is a distinctive feature in its morphology. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Tragopogon marginifolius is also known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, leading to the creation of new, sometimes invasive, varieties."
