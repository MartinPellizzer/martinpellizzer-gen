    "intro": "Tapinanthus unyorensis, commonly known as the East African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, creeping stem with small, scale-like leaves. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host plants if left unchecked."
