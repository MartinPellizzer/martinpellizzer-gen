    "intro": "Trigonostemon diplopetalus, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture making. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
