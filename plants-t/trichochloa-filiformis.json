    "intro": "Trichochloa filiformis, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to New Zealand. It features fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, giving it a delicate and feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Trichochloa filiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
