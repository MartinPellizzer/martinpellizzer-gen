    "intro": "Thelypteris subalpina, commonly known as the Alpine shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. It is a small to medium-sized fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris subalpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where other plant species struggle to survive."
