    "intro": "Taraxacum irroratum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-tomentose leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem and a puffball-like seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in ecological succession."
