    "intro": "Teucrium flavum var. glabatum, commonly known as the smooth blue germander, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, though the variety 'glabatum' is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
