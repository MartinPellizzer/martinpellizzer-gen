    "intro": "Taraxacum revertitans, commonly known as the reversing dandelion, is a rare and unusual species of the dandelion genus. It is characterized by its unique ability to reverse the direction of its flower heads, a trait that sets it apart from other dandelion species. Botanically, it exhibits a rosette of basal leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports its flowering structure. Its flowering period is brief, typically occurring in late summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils in temperate regions."
