    "intro": "Tilia dasystyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to those of other lime species. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. Tilia dasystyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in woodland habitats."
