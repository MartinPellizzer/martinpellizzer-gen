    "intro": "Trichoglottis collenetteae, commonly known as the Collenette's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the highland regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structure. The plant produces linear, lance-shaped leaves and bears inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that lack a distinct scent. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
