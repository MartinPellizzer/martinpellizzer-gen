    "intro": "Temnolepis scrophulariifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and tubular, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing vivid purple or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Temnolepis scrophulariifolia is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
