    "intro": "Thelymitra pauciflora var. holmesii, commonly known as the Holmes' leek-orchid, is an endemic orchid species found in the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a spike. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils within open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
