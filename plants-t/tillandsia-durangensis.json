    "intro": "Tillandsia durangensis, commonly known as the Durango air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with purple flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts."
