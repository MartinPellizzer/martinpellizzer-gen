    "intro": "Trifolium microcephalum var. bipedale, commonly known as the small-headed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its low-growing habit and dense foliage, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
