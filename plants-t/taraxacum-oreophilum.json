    "intro": "Taraxacum oreophilum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its yellow composite flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts, and it produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds. Due to its preference for high-altitude environments, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
