    "intro": "Torrubia cacerensis, commonly known as the Caceres torrubia, is a rare and endemic shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open woodland or scrubland habitats. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually pink or white, appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
