It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Turkia lasiocarpa is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton.
