    "intro": "Trifolium amplectens, commonly known as the clasping clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Trifolium amplectens is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
