    "intro": "Thelypteris hillii, commonly known as the Hill's water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green to silvery in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris hillii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
