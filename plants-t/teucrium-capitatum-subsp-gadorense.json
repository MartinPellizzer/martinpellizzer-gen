    "intro": "Teucrium capitatum subsp. gadorense, commonly known as the Canary Islands germander, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
