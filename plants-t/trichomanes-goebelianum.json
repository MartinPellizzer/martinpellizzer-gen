    "intro": "Trichomanes goebelianum, commonly known as the Goebelian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, lacy appearance. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes goebelianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
