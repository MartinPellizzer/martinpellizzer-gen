    "intro": "Trichosalpinx carmeniae, commonly known as the Carmen's spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, slender petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichosalpinx carmeniae is considered a rare and endangered species."
