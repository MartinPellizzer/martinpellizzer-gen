    "intro": "Tragacantha cruckshanksii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and papery seed pods. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are typically small and trifoliate, while its stems are woody and branching. The smooth tragacanth is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a water thickener."
