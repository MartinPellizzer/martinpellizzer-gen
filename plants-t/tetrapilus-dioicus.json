    "intro": "Tetrapilus dioicus, commonly known as the two-petaled fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is known for its unique reproductive structures. It has separate male and female gametophytes, which is a feature of its dioecious nature. The fronds are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue, which aids in gas exchange in its aquatic environment."
