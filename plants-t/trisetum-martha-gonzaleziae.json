    "intro": "Trisetum martha-gonzaleziae, commonly known as Martha Gonzalez's sedge, is a rare grass species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
