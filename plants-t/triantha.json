It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the western United States. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Triantha species are often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks."
