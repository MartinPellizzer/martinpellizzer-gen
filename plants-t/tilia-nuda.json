    "intro": "Tilia nuda, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
