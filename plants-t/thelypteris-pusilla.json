    "intro": "Thelypteris pusilla, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a pale green to silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. Thelypteris pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
