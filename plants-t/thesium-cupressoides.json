It is a small shrub characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas.
