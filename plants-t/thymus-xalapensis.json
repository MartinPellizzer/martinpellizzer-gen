    "intro": "Thymus xalapensis, commonly known as Mexican thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus xalapensis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
