    "intro": "Thymus granatensis, commonly known as Granada thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features aromatic, narrow, gray-green leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, often found in dry, limestone soils. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal uses. Thymus granatensis is also appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens and its role in traditional herbal remedies."
