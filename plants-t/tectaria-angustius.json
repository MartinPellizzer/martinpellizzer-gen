    "intro": "Tectaria angustius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Tectaria angustius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
