    "intro": "Tanacetum richterioides, commonly known as the Richter's tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within the Tanacetum genus."
