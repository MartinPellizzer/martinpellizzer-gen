    "intro": "Trema guineense f. strigosum, commonly known as the hairy trema, is a variant of the species Trema guineense, which belongs to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy or strigose foliage, which gives it its specific epithet \"strigosum.\" The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a rough texture due to the dense pubescence. This plant is native to tropical Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
