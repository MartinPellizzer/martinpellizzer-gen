    "intro": "Trichomanes pyxidiferum var. limbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
