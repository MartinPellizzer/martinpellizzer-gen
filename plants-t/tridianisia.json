    "intro": "Tridianisia, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, lantern-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Tridianisia species are known for their showy inflorescences, which consist of clusters of small, tubular flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
