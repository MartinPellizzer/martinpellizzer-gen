    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 pseudogranatensis, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Thymus \u00d7 pseudogranatensis is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
