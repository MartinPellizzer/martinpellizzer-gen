    "intro": "Tectaria amphiblestra, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into lobes. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Tectaria amphiblestra thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories."
