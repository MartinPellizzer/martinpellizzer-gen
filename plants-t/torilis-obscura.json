    "intro": "Torilis obscura, commonly known as the common hedge parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. Its fruits are dry, ribbed, and three-angled, typical of the carrot family. Torilis obscura is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
