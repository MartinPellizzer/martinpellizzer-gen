    "intro": "Taraxacum staticifolium, commonly known as the bog dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single flowering stem. It is native to wetland and bog habitats in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots form a dense, fibrous network. Taraxacum staticifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and supports various pollinators."
