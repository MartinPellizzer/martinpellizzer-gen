    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. verticillatus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent ground cover, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is often used in landscaping and culinary applications due to its aromatic properties and hardiness."
