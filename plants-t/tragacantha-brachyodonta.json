It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from its bark and used in various industrial applications. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the dry climate of its native habitat.
