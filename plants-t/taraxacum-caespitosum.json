    "intro": "Taraxacum caespitosum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a \"clock,\" which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum caespitosum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
