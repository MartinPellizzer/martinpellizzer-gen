    "intro": "Tridactyle scottellii var. stipulata, commonly known as the stipulate tridactyle, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
