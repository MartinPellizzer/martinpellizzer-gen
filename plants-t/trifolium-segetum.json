    "intro": "Trifolium segetum, commonly known as field clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a single stem. This plant is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Trifolium segetum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
