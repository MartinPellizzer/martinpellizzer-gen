    "intro": "Tamridaea capsulifera, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its seed capsules are distinctive, with a unique structure that aids in seed dispersal. Tamridaea capsulifera plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
