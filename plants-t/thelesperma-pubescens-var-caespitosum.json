    "intro": "Thelesperma pubescens var. caespitosum, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for restoration projects in native plant landscapes."
