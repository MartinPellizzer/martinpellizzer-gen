    "intro": "Tafalla grisebachii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
