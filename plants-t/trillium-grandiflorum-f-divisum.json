    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. divisum, commonly known as the divided white trillium, is a rare and striking variant of the white trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive division of the three leaf-like structures, which are typically split into two lobes. This form is a naturally occurring variant that exhibits unique morphological features compared to the typical form. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, typical of the Trillium genus. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in eastern North America."
