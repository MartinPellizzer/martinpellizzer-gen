    "intro": "Tournesol plicata, commonly known as the pleated sunflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves that give it its common name, and its large, showy yellow flowers with a prominent central disk. Native to South America, this plant thrives in warm, sunny climates and well-drained soils. Its growth habit is typically upright, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, making it a dramatic addition to gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds, though it is not as widely used for oil production as other sunflower varieties."
