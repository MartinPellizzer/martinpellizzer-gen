    "intro": "Telipogon endresianus, commonly known as the Endresian's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Its botanical features include specialized pollination mechanisms adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
