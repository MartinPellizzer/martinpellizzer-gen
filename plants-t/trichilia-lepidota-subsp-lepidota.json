It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and alternate, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or greenish-white clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that split open to release seeds.
