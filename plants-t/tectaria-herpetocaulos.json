    "intro": "Tectaria herpetocaulos, commonly known as the snake-stalked tectaria, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features a rhizome that is covered with a thick, leathery cuticle, which helps it retain moisture. Its fronds are usually pinnate, with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
