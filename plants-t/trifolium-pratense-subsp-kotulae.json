    "intro": "Trifolium pratense subsp. kotulae, commonly known as Kotula's red clover, is a subspecies of red clover native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobia bacteria. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
