    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 edwardii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between wild einkorn wheat (Triticum tauschii) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum). It is a perennial grass that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, including robust growth and high drought tolerance. The plant has a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, hard grains. It is native to the Fertile Crescent and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture and as a source of nutritious grain. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in the study of wheat genetics and crop improvement."
