    "intro": "Trichogalium, commonly known as the \"snake's head\" or \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble butterflies or other insects, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Their leaves are usually opposite and simple, with a somewhat leathery texture. Trichogalium species are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique floral displays."
