    "intro": "Taraxacum tundricola, commonly known as the tundra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces small, yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss in harsh environments."
