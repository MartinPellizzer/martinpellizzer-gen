    "intro": "Taraxacum obscuratum, commonly known as the dark dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flowering head. The flowers are typically yellow, with a composite structure consisting of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This species is notable for its ability to spread through rhizomes and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
