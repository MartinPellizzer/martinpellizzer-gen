    "intro": "Trifolium glaciale, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Trifolium glaciale thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its low-growing habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
