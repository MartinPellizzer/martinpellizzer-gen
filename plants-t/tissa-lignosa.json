    "intro": "Tissa lignosa, commonly known as the hardwood tree, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, durable wood that is highly valued for construction and furniture-making. The plant has a slow growth rate, which contributes to the rarity and high cost of its timber. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Tissa lignosa also produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
