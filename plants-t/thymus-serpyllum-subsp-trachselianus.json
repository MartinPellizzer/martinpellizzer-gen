    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. trachselianus, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, creeping stems with small, oval leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and aromatic foliage, it is a valued plant in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
