    "intro": "Tulipa scabriscapa var. hawardeniana, commonly known as the Hawarden tulip, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and vibrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange-red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, showcasing its striking floral display. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
