    "intro": "Tunica illyrica var. haynaldiana, commonly known as the Haynald's tunica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
