    "intro": "Thelypteris crenata, commonly known as the notched shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and India. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a serrated or notched margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative propagation. Thelypteris crenata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
