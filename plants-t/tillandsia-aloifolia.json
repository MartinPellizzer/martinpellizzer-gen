    "intro": "Tillandsia aloifolia, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
