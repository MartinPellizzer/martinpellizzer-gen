    "intro": "Thelocactus conothelos subsp. flavus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered thelocactus, is a cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to grayish-blue spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, a common adaptation in arid environments. This subspecies is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in succulent gardens."
