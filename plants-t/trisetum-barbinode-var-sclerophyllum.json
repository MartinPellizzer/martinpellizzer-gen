    "intro": "Trisetum barbinode var. sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved beardgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically rigid and covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, coarse texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features make it a resilient plant capable of thriving in poor soil conditions."
