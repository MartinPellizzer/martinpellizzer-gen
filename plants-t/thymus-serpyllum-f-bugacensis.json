    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. bugacensis, commonly known as the Bugac thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Carpathian region of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
