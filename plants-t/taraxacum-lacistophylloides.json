    "intro": "Taraxacum lacistophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower and later develops a fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. It is native to Europe and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
