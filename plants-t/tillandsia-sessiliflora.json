    "intro": "Tillandsia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a small water-holding cup at the center. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Tillandsia sessiliflora is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil contact for survival."
