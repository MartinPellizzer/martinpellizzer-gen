    "intro": "Thelypteris glanduligera var. elatior, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, glandular dots on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a distinctive component of its native habitat."
