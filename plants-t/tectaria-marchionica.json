    "intro": "Tectaria marchionica, commonly known as the Marchionni's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical forests and mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus. Tectaria marchionica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
