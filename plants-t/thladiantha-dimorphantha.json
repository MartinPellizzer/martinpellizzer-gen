    "intro": "Thladiantha dimorphantha, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bittersweet, is a climbing vine native to parts of Africa and Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy fruits that split open to reveal bright orange seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
