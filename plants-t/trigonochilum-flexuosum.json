    "intro": "Trigonochilum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from the base of the previous one. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. The flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species."
