    "intro": "Tillandsia ionantha, commonly known as the silver pine or miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia ionantha is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
