    "intro": "Timonius corneri var. penangianus, commonly known as the Penang timonius, is a rare tropical plant native to the island of Penang in Malaysia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
