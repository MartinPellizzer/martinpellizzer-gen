    "intro": "Taxillus reflexilobus, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Taxillus, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. Its berries are typically red or yellow and are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Taxillus reflexilobus is found in various regions of Asia and is often associated with specific host species such as oaks and maples."
