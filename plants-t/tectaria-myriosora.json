    "intro": "Tectaria myriosora, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The fronds are usually divided into segments, with the uppermost leaves being the most prominent and distinctive features of the plant."
