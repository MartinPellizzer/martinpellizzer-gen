    "intro": "Thymus burnatii, commonly known as Burnat's thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact clusters of small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it a strong, minty fragrance and medicinal properties."
