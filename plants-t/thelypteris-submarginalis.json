    "intro": "Thelypteris submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive marginal vein that runs along the edge of the leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups called indusia. Thelypteris submarginalis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
