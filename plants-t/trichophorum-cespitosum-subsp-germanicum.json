    "intro": "Trichophorum cespitosum subsp. germanicum, commonly known as the German tussock grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant forms dense tussocks with a rosette of basal leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific ecological preferences."
