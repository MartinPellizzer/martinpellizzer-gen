    "intro": "Tephrocactus inermis, commonly known as the naked cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered with small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Tephrocactus inermis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and resilient member of the cactus family."
