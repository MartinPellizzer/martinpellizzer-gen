    "intro": "Taraxacum cephalum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Taraxacum cephalum is known for its medicinal properties and is often considered a weed in gardens and lawns."
