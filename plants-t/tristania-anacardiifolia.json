    "intro": "Tristania anacardiifolia, commonly known as the Natal holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and resemble the leaves of the cashew tree. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Tristania anacardiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
