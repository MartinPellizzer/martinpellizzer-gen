    "intro": "Toulicia anomala, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments with rich organic soil. The plant has a unique growth habit, with its roots forming a dense network that helps anchor it in swampy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
