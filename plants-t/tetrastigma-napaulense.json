It belongs to the grape family (Vitaceae) and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by yellowish berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
