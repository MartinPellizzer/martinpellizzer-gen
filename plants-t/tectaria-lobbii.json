    "intro": "Tectaria lobbii, commonly known as the Robust Tectaria, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
