    "intro": "Trichomanes repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a small, delicate fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, stream banks, and forest floors, where it can absorb moisture through its thin, papery leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes repens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to humid, low-light conditions."
