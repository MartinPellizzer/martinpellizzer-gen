It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a silver-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Trigonotis pleiomera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
