    "intro": "Taraxacum amplum, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped basal leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a distinctive white, fluffy seed head. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Taraxacum amplum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
