    "intro": "Trichostephus, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the milkweed family, Apocynaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. Trichostephus species typically have milky sap, which can be toxic to animals and humans. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their drought-resistant features. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
