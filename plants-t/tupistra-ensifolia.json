    "intro": "Tupistra ensifolia, commonly known as the sword leaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
