    "intro": "Thalictrum occidentale var. typicum, commonly known as western meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a fibrous root system, often reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are deeply divided into narrow, fern-like lobes, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
