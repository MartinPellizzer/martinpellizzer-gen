It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences composed of small, two-lobed spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
