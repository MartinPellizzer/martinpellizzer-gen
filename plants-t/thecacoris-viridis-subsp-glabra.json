    "intro": "Thecacoris viridis subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth green lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a thin, greenish thallus with a smooth, leathery texture, which distinguishes it from other subspecies. The plant lacks distinct lobes and has a uniform appearance, making it easily identifiable in its habitat. It is typically found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate regions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
