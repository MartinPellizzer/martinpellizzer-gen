    "intro": "Tillandsia turneri var. patens, commonly known as the Silver Vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
