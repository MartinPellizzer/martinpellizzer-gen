    "intro": "Taraxacum petiolulatum, commonly known as the slender-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, petiolate leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-equipped seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
