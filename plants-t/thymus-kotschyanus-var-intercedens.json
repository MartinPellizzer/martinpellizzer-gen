    "intro": "Thymus kotschyanus var. intercedens, commonly known as the Armenian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and long-lasting blooms."
