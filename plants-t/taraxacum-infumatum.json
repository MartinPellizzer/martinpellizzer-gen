    "intro": "Taraxacum infumatum, commonly known as the smoky dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem topped with a spherical cluster of seeds, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. The flowers are typically yellow and bloom in early spring, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
