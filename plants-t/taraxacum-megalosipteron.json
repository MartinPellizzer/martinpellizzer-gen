    "intro": "Taraxacum megalosipteron, commonly known as the giant-flowered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow composite flower heads and heart-shaped basal leaves. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive elongated, hollow stem that supports its bright yellow inflorescence. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, typical of the genus Taraxacum."
