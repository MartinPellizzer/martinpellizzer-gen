    "intro": "Taraxacum norvegicum, commonly known as the Norwegian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its parachute-like seeds, which are carried by the wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae and is closely related to other dandelion species."
