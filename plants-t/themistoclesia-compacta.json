    "intro": "Themistoclesia compacta, commonly known as the compact thimble cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It features a dense, spiny exterior that protects it from herbivores and excessive water loss. The plant has a short, branched stem with small, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for spines. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
