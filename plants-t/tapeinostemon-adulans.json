    "intro": "Tapeinostemon adulans, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, demonstrating its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
