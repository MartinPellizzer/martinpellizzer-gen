    "intro": "Tephroseris papposa subsp. microrrhiza, commonly known as the small-rooted tephroseris, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its subspecies name, *microrrhiza*, refers to its small root system, which is adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. This plant is well-suited to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
