    "intro": "Taraxacum linguatifrons, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed ball. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
