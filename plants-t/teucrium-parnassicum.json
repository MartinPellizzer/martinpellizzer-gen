    "intro": "Teucrium parnassicum, commonly known as the alpine germander, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Teucrium parnassicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
