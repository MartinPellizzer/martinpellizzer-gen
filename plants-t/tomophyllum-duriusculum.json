    "intro": "Tomophyllum duriusculum, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy, and sometimes reddish leaves. The plant produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
