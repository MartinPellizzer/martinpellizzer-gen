    "intro": "Tillandsia pfeufferi, commonly known as the Pfeuffer's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain water in its natural habitat. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
