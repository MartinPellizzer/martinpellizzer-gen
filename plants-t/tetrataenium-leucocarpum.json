    "intro": "Tetrataenium leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fruited tetrataenium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, and the fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
