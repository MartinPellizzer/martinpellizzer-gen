    "intro": "Taraxacum barbatulum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers and a hairy, spherical seed head that aids in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and have a distinctive lobed shape with hairy surfaces. The hairy dandelion is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
