    "intro": "Thecophyllum gloriosum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in dense, yellowish-green spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and adapted for water storage, typical of desert flora. Thecophyllum gloriosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry environments."
