    "intro": "Thelypteris augescens var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, dark green leaves. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a dense canopy that aids in moisture retention and habitat creation for small organisms."
