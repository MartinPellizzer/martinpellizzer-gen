    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. arborea, commonly known as the European tamarisk or tree tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, often branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pink or pale purple flowers in summer, which are followed by small, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to dry, saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
