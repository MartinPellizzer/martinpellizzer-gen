    "intro": "Trifolium mucronatum subsp. vaughanae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
