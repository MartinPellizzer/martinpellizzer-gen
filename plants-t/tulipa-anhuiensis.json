    "intro": "Tulipa anhuiensis, commonly known as the Anhui tulip, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces showy blooms in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
