    "intro": "Trapa hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its floating, spiny fruits that resemble chestnuts, which contain the seeds. The plant has slender, branched stems that grow in shallow water, and its leaves are usually submerged or floating. Trapa hungarica thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
