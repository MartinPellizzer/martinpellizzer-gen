    "intro": "Taraxacum turfosiforme, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves that form a dense, turf-like structure. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
