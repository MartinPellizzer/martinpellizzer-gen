    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 praecox, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in umbellate clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in making musical instruments and as a source of honey."
