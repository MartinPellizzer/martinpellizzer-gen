    "intro": "Thecacoris humbertii var. anjanaharibes, commonly known as the Anjanaharibe's corymbia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
