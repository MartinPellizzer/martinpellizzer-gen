    "intro": "Tectaria gaudichaudii, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid environments, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of its fertile fronds. Tectaria gaudichaudii plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to forest floor cover and providing shelter for small organisms."
