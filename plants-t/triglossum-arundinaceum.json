It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Triglossum arundinaceum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
