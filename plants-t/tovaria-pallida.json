    "intro": "Tovaria pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and small, delicate white flowers. Tovaria pallida is known for its unique ability to thrive in low-light conditions, which contributes to its elusive nature. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
