    "intro": "Themeda polycephala, commonly known as spear grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture that makes it useful in livestock feed. Themeda polycephala is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in its habitat."
