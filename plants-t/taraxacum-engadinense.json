    "intro": "Taraxacum engadinense, commonly known as the Engadine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a ball-shaped seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
