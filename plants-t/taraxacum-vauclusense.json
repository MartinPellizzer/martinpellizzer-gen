    "intro": "Taraxacum vauclusense, commonly known as the French dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. Botanically, it is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties."
