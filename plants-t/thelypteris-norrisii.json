    "intro": "Thelypteris norrisii, commonly known as the Norris holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusium. Thelypteris norrisii thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant member of the fern flora."
