    "intro": "Torreyochloa pauciflora var. microtheca, commonly known as the dwarf torrey grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
