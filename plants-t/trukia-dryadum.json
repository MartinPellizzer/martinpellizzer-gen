    "intro": "Trukia dryadum, commonly known as the dryad's ghost, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trukia dryadum is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
