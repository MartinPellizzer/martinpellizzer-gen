    "intro": "Torreycactus, commonly known as the fishhook cactus, is a unique species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that often curve into a hook-like shape, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are usually yellow or orange and bloom in clusters at the ends of the stems. Torreycactus is a slow-growing plant that requires well-draining soil and minimal watering to thrive."
