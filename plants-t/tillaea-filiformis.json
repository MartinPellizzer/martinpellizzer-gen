    "intro": "Tillaea filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Tillaea filiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
