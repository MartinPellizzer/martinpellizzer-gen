    "intro": "Taraxacum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and a single, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its life cycle includes a rosette of leaves followed by a flowering stem, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
