    "intro": "Trichomanes erosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Trichomanes erosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
