    "intro": "Taraxacum canescens, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are softly pubescent. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers develop into distinctive white, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
