    "intro": "Trianthema crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique feature is the presence of crystalline structures on its leaves, which help reduce water loss. Trianthema crystallinum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
