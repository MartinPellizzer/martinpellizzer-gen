    "intro": "Tectaria heterosora, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus. Tectaria heterosora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
