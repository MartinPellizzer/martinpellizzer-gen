    "intro": "Toona microcarpa var. sahnii, commonly known as the Sahni toona, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the toona genus native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spherical capsules that contain its seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for taxonomists and botanists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, the conservation status of this variant remains uncertain."
