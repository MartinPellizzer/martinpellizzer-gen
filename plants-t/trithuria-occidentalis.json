    "intro": "Trithuria occidentalis, commonly known as the western starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. Trithuria occidentalis plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
