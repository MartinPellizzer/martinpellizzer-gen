    "intro": "Tellima heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tellima, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that vary in shape and size across different parts of the plant. The plant produces small, clustered white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are a food source for birds. Tellima heterophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and horticultural interest."
