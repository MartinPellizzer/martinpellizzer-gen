    "intro": "Tillandsia tristis, commonly known as the weeping air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces long, pendulous flower spikes that give it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a grayish-green coloration. Tillandsia tristis is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
