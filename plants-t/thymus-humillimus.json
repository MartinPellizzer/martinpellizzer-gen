    "intro": "Thymus humillimus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent ground cover plant in gardens and rocky landscapes. Thymus humillimus is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
