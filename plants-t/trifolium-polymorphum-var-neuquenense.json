    "intro": "Trifolium polymorphum var. neuquenense, commonly known as the Neuqu\u00e9n clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America, specifically Argentina. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
