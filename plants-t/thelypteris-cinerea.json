    "intro": "Thelypteris cinerea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris cinerea plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
