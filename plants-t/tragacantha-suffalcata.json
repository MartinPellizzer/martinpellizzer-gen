    "intro": "Tragacantha suffalcata, commonly known as Persian gum or Astrachan gum, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing a resinous gum, which is harvested for commercial use. Tragacantha suffalcata is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its gum has been used historically in medicine, food, and as a binding agent in various industries."
