    "intro": "Tilia glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, smooth, and often hairless leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its heartwood is light brown and has a fine, even texture, making it valuable for woodworking. Tilia glabrata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates."
