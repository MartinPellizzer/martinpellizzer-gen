    "intro": "Taraxacum irrigatum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold climates. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. Taraxacum irrigatum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
