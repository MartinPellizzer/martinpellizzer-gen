It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed glumes and awned lemmas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
