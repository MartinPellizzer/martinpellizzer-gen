    "intro": "Triumfetta semitriloba var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants such as hibiscus and cotton. The plant is often found growing along rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, adapting well to extreme drought conditions."
