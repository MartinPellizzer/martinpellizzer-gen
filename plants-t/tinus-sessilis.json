    "intro": "Tinus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile tinus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Tinus sessilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance."
