    "intro": "Tillandsia benthamiana, commonly known as the Bentham's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, arranged in a rosette pattern that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale purple. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
