    "intro": "Tillandsia carlos-hankii, commonly known as the Mexican silver sword, is a rare bromeliad native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a small, evergreen plant with a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically in the spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
