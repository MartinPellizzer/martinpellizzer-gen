    "intro": "Tillandsia churinensis, commonly known as the Churin air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts."
