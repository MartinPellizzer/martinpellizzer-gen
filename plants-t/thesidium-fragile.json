    "intro": "Thesidium fragile, commonly known as the delicate thistle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fibrous roots are adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils, and it is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Thesidium fragile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
