    "intro": "Tradescantia carinata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help it climb or trail along surfaces. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, and it prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Tradescantia carinata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
