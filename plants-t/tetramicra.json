    "intro": "Tetramicra, commonly known as the \"four-winged\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems, which are typical of the mallow family. The leaves are usually alternate and ovate, with a rough texture. Tetramicra species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. These plants play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as host plants for certain insects."
