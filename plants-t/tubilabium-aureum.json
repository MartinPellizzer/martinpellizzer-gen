    "intro": "Tubilabium aureum, commonly known as the golden trumpet plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, soft hairs. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
