    "intro": "Trithrinax acanthocoma, commonly known as the spiny palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its robust, clustered stems and long, pinnate leaves that are often covered in sharp spines. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered inflorescences that produce yellowish flowers, followed by small, round fruits. Trithrinax acanthocoma is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
