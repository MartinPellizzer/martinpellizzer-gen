    "intro": "Tectaria elata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a large, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Tectaria elata plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various organisms."
