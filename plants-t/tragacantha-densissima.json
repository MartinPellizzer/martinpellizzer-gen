    "intro": "Tragacantha densissima, commonly known as the dense thorned tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a viscous gum, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of Mediterranean ecosystems."
