It is a small, spineless cactus with a dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features pale green, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in summer, and are clustered at the stem tips. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
