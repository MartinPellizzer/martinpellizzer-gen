    "intro": "Tormentilla linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean tormentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, red berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and wetland habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
