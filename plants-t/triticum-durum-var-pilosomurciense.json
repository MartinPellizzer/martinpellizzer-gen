This variety exhibits a distinctive hairy covering on its stems and leaves, which is a notable feature in its taxonomic classification. It is native to the Murcia region in Spain, where it has adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. The plant typically grows to a moderate height, with spikelets that produce hard, amber-colored grains. Its genetic makeup contributes to its resilience and is of interest for agricultural research and breeding programs."
