    "intro": "Thymophylla gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant features small, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Thymophylla gypsophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
