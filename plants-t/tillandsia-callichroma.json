    "intro": "Tillandsia callichroma, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its striking silver-blue foliage and vibrant orange flowers make it a popular ornamental plant. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate watering to maintain its health and bloom."
