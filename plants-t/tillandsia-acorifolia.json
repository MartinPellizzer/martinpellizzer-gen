    "intro": "Tillandsia acorifolia, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to tree branches or other surfaces. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and white, appearing in clusters at the center of the rosette. Native to the southeastern United States, it is well adapted to humid, tropical climates."
