    "intro": "Tephrosia angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf tephrosia, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Tephrosia angustifolia is also valued for its potential use in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
