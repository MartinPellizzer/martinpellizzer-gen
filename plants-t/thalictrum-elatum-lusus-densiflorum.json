It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that provide a delicate texture to the landscape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to woodland gardens and wetland habitats."
