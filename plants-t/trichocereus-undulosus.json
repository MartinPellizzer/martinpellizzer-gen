    "intro": "Trichocereus undulosus, commonly known as the \"Moon Cactus\" or \"Night Blooming Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that open at night, a feature that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Trichocereus undulosus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior."
