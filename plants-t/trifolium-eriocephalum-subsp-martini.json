    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum subsp. martini, commonly known as the Sierra foothill clover, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically composed of three oval or rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense spherical heads, a feature that gives it its specific epithet \"eriocephalum,\" meaning \"woolly-headed.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
