    "intro": "Toxicodendron oxycarpum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its urushiol-containing sap, it can cause severe skin irritation upon contact."
