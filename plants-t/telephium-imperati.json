    "intro": "Telephium imperati, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Crambe, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss, an adaptation to its often arid environments. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
