    "intro": "Teganium, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce dandelion-like yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. Teganium species are characterized by their finely divided leaves and their ability to thrive in disturbed soils. They are often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where they can spread readily through wind-dispersed seeds."
