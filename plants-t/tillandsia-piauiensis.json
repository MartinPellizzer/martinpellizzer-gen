    "intro": "Tillandsia piauiensis, commonly known as the Piaui air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and green. Tillandsia piauiensis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
