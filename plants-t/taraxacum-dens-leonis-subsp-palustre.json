    "intro": "Taraxacum dens-leonis subsp. palustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in white pubescence. The plant produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in early spring. Its flowering stem is typically shorter than that of other dandelion species, and the leaves are more elongated and less toothed. The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
