    "intro": "Teucrium fruticans var. rotundifolium, commonly known as round-leaved germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are ovate to round in shape, with a slightly succulent texture and a grayish-green color due to their dense pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
