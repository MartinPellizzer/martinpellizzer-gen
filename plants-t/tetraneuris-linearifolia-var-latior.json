    "intro": "Tetraneuris linearifolia var. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are broader than the standard variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This variant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
