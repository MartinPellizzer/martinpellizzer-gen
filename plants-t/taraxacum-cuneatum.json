    "intro": "Taraxacum cuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces fluffy seeds. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its resilience to environmental stress. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy during winter, with the leaves emerging in spring to support the growth of the flowering stem."
