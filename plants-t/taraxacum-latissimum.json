    "intro": "Taraxacum latissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which bloom in spring and early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is known for its medicinal properties."
