    "intro": "Tmesipteris sigmatifolia, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its feathery, sword-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Tmesipteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant has a distinctive rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination process. Tmesipteris sigmatifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
