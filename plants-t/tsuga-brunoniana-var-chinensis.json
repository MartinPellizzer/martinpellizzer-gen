It is a coniferous evergreen with needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its slow growth and dense foliage make it a valuable ornamental and ecological species."
