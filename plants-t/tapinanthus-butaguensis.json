    "intro": "Tapinanthus butaguensis, commonly known as the Butagu\u00e9 dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Central Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure that allows it to spread across its host. It is often found on trees and shrubs in humid, tropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host, making it an important subject in ecological studies."
