    "intro": "Tridentea herrei, commonly known as the Red River fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the wetlands of Vietnam. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often tinged with red or pink at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its rhizomes are slender and help anchor it to the substrate in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tridentea herrei is considered a vulnerable species."
