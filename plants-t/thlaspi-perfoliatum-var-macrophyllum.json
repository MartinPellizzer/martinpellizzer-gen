    "intro": "Thlaspi perfoliatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its larger, more robust leaves."
