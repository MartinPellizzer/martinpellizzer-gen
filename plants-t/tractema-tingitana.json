    "intro": "Tractema tingitana, commonly known as the Atlantic coast dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, yellow composite flower that blooms in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the sea coast, where it is adapted to salty air and strong winds. Its seeds are dispersed by the wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. Tractema tingitana is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
