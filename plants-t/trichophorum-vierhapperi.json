    "intro": "Trichophorum vierhapperi, commonly known as the Alpine hair grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trichophorum vierhapperi plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
