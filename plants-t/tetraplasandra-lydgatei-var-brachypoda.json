    "intro": "Tetraplasandra lydgatei var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed pandanus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Pandanus genus, characterized by its distinctive, fibrous leaves and woody stems. The plant typically grows in coastal or swampy areas, where it thrives in humid and saline conditions. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
