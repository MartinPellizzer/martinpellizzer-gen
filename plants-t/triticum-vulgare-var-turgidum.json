    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. turgidum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its lack of a hard outer hull on the grains. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-rowed grains. This variety is often used in animal feed and has also been utilized in traditional brewing and baking practices."
