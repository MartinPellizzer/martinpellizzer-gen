    "intro": "Tillandsia gutteana, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Tillandsia gutteana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
