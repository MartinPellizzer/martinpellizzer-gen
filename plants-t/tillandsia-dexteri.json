    "intro": "Tillandsia dexteri, commonly known as the Dexteri air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. It produces showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, Tillandsia dexteri is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
