    "intro": "Tounatea caribaea, commonly known as the Caribbean mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The tree's wood is highly valued for its strength and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in carpentry and furniture making. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some areas."
