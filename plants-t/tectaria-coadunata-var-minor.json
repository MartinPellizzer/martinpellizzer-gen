    "intro": "Tectaria coadunata var. minor, commonly known as the small tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The varietal form, minor, is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact fronds compared to the typical species."
