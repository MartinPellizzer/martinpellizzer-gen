    "intro": "Tetramicra riparia, commonly known as the river willow, is a shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a hairy texture. Tetramicra riparia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil along water edges and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
