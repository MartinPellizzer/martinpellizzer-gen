    "intro": "Thysanocarpus filipes, commonly known as the silky filicleaf, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or yellow, followed by distinctive, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The silky filicleaf is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
