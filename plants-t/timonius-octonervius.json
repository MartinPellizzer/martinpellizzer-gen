    "intro": "Timonius octonervius, commonly known as the eight-veined timon, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Timoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive eight main veins in its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius octonervius is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
