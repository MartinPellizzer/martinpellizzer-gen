    "intro": "Trifolium tridentatum var. polyodon, commonly known as the three-toothed clover, is a variant of the common clover species native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinct, toothed margin that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, white or pale pink flowers appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
