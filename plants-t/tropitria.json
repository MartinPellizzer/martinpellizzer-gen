    "intro": "Tropitria, commonly known as the \"fairy lantern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often biennial or perennial growth habit and their clusters of small, yellow or greenish flowers. The fruits, known as schizocarps, split into two parts when mature, each containing a single seed. Tropitria species are typically found in temperate regions and are often grown as ornamental plants for their attractive foliage and flowers. They are also valued in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
