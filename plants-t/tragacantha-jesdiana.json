    "intro": "Tragacantha jesdiana, commonly known as the Jesdian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils with minimal water availability."
