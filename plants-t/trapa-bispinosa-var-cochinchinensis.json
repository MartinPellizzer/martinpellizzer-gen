It features floating leaves with long, narrow petioles and spiny, inflated fruits that aid in buoyancy and seed dispersal. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as marshes and ponds. Its unique morphology includes two spines on the fruit, which are adaptations for clinging to aquatic vegetation. The species is valued for its edible seeds and has ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
