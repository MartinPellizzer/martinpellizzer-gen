    "intro": "Tetraphyle corallina, commonly known as the coral-like sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, coralline-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tetraphyle corallina is adapted to saline environments and is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
