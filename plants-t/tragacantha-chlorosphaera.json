    "intro": "Tragacantha chlorosphaera, commonly known as the green sphere tragacanth, is a unique species within the Astragalus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive green, spherical seed pods that contain a viscous gum, which is commercially valuable. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
