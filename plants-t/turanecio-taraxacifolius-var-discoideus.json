    "intro": "Turanecio taraxacifolius var. discoideus, commonly known as the disk-shaped dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its unique inflorescence. It features a compact, disk-like flower head that contrasts with the typical fluffy seed heads of other dandelion varieties. The plant has finely dissected, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive floral structure."
