    "intro": "Tillandsia humilis, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States and northern South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for nourishment, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant's long, hanging strands of soft, greenish-gray foliage create a dense, moss-like appearance. It plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small animals and insects. Despite its name, it is not a true moss but a member of the bromeliad family."
