    "intro": "Telipogon stinae, commonly known as the Stinae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, ephemeral flowers that bloom for only a short period. The plant is epiphytic, growing on tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its small, white petals and lack of leaves make it difficult to detect in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Telipogon stinae is considered a conservation concern."
