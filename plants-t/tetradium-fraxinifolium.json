    "intro": "Tetradium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the Chinese sandpaper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are typically orange or red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental bark and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
