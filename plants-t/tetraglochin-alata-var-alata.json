    "intro": "Tetraglochin alata var. alata, commonly known as the winged tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems that provide structural support and aid in reducing water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are scale-like and densely packed, which helps minimize transpiration in hot, dry environments. Tetraglochin alata var. alata is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in riparian zones and disturbed areas."
