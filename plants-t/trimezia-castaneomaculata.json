It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white or pink with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
