    "intro": "Torreya fargesii var. yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to southwestern China. It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically appearing in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded forest environments, often found at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
