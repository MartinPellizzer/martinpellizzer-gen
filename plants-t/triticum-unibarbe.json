    "intro": "Triticum unibarbe, commonly known as the one-barbed wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its single barb on the lemma of its florets, distinguishing it from other wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. The botanical features of Triticum unibarbe make it an important subject in the study of cereal grasses and their genetic diversity."
