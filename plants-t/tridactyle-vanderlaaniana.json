The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, needle-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. It produces delicate, often pink or white, flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
