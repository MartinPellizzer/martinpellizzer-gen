    "intro": "Taeniopsis falcata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in small, brownish scales. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique feature among ferns."
