    "intro": "Triticum brevisetum, commonly known as the short-settle wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces tiny grains that are typically less than 2 millimeters in length, which distinguishes it from more common wheat varieties. Triticum brevisetum is notable for its high genetic diversity and potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat resilience. Due to its rarity, it is considered a valuable but poorly understood crop in botanical research."
