    "intro": "Tillandsia schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and violet or pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia schultzei is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
