It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris limaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
