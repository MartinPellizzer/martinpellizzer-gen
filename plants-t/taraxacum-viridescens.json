    "intro": "Taraxacum viridescens, commonly known as the greenish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its flowers develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum viridescens is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
