It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces daisy-like inflorescences with bright yellow to orange petals.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
