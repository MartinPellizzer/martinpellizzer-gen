    "intro": "Tetralobus pusillus, commonly known as the small-lobed dwarf fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate to tetrafoliate leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its habitat."
