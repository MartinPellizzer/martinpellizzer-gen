    "intro": "Tillandsia regina, commonly known as the Royal Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage with a textured appearance, which helps it capture and retain water efficiently. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, adding visual interest. Tillandsia regina is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique aesthetic."
