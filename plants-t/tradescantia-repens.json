    "intro": "Tradescantia repens, commonly known as the snake plant or mother of thousands, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Caribbean and Central America. It features fleshy, linear leaves that are typically bright green with red or purple markings along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers on slender stalks, which are followed by tiny, arrow-shaped propagules that can take root when they fall to the ground. It is well adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in certain environments."
