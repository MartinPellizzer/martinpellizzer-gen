    "intro": "Thymus jankae var. gusinjensis, commonly known as the Gusinjensk thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit with aromatic, narrow leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
