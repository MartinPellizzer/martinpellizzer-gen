    "intro": "Trachomitum venetum subsp. tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric trachomitus, is a rare and specialized fern native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are arranged in a unique pattern along the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
