    "intro": "Thymelaea tinctoria var. vermiculata, commonly known as the variegated thyme-leaf buckthorn, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
