    "intro": "Tecoma uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp trumpetflower, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, with a slightly hairy texture. Tecoma uliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
