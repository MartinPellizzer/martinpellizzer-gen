    "intro": "Tetrazygos, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a species of the genus Trifolium, belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Tetrazygos is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and symbolic significance, it is often associated with good luck and is a popular subject in folklore and horticulture."
