    "intro": "Taraxacum uschakovii var. pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's dandelion, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem topped with a single, yellow composite flower head. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, often growing in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
