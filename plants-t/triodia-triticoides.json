    "intro": "Triodia triticoides, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a hardy perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and wiry, spiky leaves that form a low-lying mat. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small animals. Triodia triticoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping in drought-prone regions."
