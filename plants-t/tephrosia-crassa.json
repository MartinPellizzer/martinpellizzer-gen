    "intro": "Tephrosia crassa, commonly known as broadleaf tephrosia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodland or savanna habitats. Tephrosia crassa is also known for its potential medicinal uses, with some species in the genus being used in traditional medicine for their purported antimalarial and anti-inflammatory properties."
