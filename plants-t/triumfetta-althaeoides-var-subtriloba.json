    "intro": "Triumfetta althaeoides var. subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed spiderling, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, often resembling a spider's web, hence its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
