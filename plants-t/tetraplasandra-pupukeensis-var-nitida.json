It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and distinctive conical shape. The plant has smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces small, conifer-like cones. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
