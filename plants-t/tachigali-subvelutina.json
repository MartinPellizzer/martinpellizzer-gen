    "intro": "Tachigali subvelutina, commonly known as the velvet tachigali, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
