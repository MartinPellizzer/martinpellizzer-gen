It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic in nature, often growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
