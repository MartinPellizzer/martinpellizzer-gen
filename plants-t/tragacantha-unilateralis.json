    "intro": "Tragacantha unilateralis, commonly known as the one-sided tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical flower structure. The plant produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots are known for their ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Tragacantha unilateralis is often cultivated for its mucilage-rich sap, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
