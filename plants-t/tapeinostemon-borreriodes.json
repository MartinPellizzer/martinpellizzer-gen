    "intro": "Tapeinostemon borreriodes, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces pink to purple blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to conserve water. Tapeinostemon borreriodes is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
