    "intro": "Tillandsia globosa var. alba, commonly known as the white globosa air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant native to Central and South America, typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and light. It produces small, white or pale flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
