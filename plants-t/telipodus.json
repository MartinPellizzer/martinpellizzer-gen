    "intro": "Telipodus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Telipodus species are herbaceous perennials that often grow in moist, shaded environments. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though they can be toxic to humans and animals."
