    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium var. nanum, commonly known as narrow-leaved clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, which are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
