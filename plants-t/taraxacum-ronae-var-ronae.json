It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-equipped seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
