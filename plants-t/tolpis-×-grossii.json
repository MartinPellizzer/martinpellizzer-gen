It is a cross between Tolpis stricta and Tolpis farinosa, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its foliage is blue-green in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax.
