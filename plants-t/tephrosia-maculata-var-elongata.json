    "intro": "Tephrosia maculata var. elongata, commonly known as the purplestem tephrosia, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves with a distinctive purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in agroforestry systems."
