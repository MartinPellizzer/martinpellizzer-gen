It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, exhibiting succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
