    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. carniolicus, commonly known as the Carpathian thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
