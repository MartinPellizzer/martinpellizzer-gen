    "intro": "Triticum durum var. complanatum, commonly known as flat wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its flattened grains. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for pasta production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in a compact inflorescence. The seeds, which are the edible part, are rich in proteins and carbohydrates, contributing to its agricultural and nutritional significance."
