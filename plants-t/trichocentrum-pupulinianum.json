    "intro": "Trichocentrum pupulinianum, commonly known as the Pupulinian orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Trichocentrum pupulinianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
