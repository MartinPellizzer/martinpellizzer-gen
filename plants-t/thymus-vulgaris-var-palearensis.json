    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. palearensis, commonly known as the pale thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces essential oils rich in thymol, which contribute to its strong aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
