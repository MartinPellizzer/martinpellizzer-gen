    "intro": "Themeda novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
