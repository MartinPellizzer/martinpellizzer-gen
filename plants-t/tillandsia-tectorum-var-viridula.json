    "intro": "Tillandsia tectorum var. viridula, commonly known as the green roof tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. This variety is characterized by its dense, compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The leaves are typically a vibrant green, which helps the plant absorb sunlight efficiently in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its hardy nature and ability to grow without soil, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and green roof applications."
