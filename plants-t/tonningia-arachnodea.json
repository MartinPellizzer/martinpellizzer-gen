    "intro": "Tonningia arachnodea, commonly known as the spider plant or air plant, is a type of epiphytic bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white, powdery coating called trichomes. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences that bear small, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ability to absorb moisture from the air, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
