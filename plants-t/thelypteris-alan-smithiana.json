    "intro": "Thelypteris alan-smithiana, commonly known as Alan-Smith's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in still or slow-moving water. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and ponds, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
