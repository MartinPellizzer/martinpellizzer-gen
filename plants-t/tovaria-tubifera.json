    "intro": "Tovaria tubifera, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant in water. Its flowers are white and fragrant, opening in the early morning and closing by midday. Tovaria tubifera plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
