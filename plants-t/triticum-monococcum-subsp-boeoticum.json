    "intro": "Triticum monococcum subsp. boeoticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a robust root system and is adapted to grow in poor soil conditions. Its seeds are small and hard, often requiring scarification for germination. It is considered a close relative of domesticated wheat and has been studied for its potential in sustainable agriculture."
