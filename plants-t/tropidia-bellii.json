    "intro": "Tropidia bellii, commonly known as the Hawaiian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tropidia bellii is considered a rare and endangered species."
