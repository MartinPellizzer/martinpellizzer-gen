    "intro": "Taraxacum dens-leonis, commonly known as the dense-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, densely packed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, elongated stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and urban environments. Taraxacum dens-leonis is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
