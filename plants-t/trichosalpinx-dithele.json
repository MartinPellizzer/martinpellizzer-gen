It is a small to medium-sized tree native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are showy, with orange-red petals and a distinctive spurred shape, attracting various pollinators. The wood of Trichosalpinx dithele is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, though it is also listed as endangered due to overharvesting."
