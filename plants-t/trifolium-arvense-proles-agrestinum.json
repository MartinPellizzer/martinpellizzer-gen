    "intro": "Trifolium arvense proles agrestinum, commonly known as the field clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has a shallow root system that allows it to colonize open areas quickly. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil."
