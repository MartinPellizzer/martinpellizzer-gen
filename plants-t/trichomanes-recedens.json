    "intro": "Trichomanes recedens, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a small, evergreen fern with delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. Trichomanes recedens thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in dense undergrowth."
