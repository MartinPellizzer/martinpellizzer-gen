    "intro": "Thesium mossii, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, compact foliage with small, waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in clusters that resemble stars, giving it its common name. Thesium mossii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray make it well-suited for coastal environments."
