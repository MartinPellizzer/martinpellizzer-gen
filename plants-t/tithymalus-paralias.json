    "intro": "Tithymalus paralias, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery-gray leaves, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tithymalus paralias is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
