    "intro": "Thelypteris diplazioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or crevices. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
