    "intro": "Tillandsia hansonii, commonly known as the Hanson's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, colorful flowers that are typically white or pink, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its unique growth habits and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
