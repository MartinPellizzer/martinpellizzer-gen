    "intro": "Tapinanthus swynnertonii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, often attaching itself to the stems or roots of other species. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting insects for pollination. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or grasslands. Due to its unique parasitic nature and striking appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
