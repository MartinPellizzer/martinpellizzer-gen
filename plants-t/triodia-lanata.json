    "intro": "Triodia lanata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has wiry, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Triodia lanata is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of the Australian flora."
