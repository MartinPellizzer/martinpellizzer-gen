It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices, which are the flowering structures typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines for their starchy texture."
