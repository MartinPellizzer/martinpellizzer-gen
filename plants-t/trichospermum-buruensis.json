    "intro": "Trichospermum buruensis, commonly known as the Buru starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruit, which resembles a small star with five points. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is edible, though it is not as commonly consumed as other starfruit varieties."
