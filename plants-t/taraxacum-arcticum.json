    "intro": "Taraxacum arcticum, commonly known as the arctic dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a ball of white, feathery seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its ability to survive in harsh climates makes it an important component of Arctic ecosystems."
