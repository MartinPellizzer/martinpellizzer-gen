It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Triumfetta pseudocolumnaris is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its compact form and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
