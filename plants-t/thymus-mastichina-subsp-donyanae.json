    "intro": "Thymus mastichina subsp. donyanae, commonly known as Donya thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly for its essential oils and antioxidant properties. This subspecies is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its unique geographic distribution and chemical composition."
