    "intro": "Tetrastigma ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic crossvine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and tendrils that aid in its climbing habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural study, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
