    "intro": "Tragacantha coriacea, commonly known as the Persian gum or Syrian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its thick, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance called tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a food additive. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in challenging climates."
