    "intro": "Tillandsia stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Tillandsia stenostachya is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
