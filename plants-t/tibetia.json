    "intro": "Tibetia, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, which come in a variety of colors including blue, purple, and white. The plants typically grow in alpine meadows and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh climate with thick, hairy foliage. Tibetia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and are valued for their resilience in cold environments."
