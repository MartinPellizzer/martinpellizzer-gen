It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Taenianthera lakoi plays a unique role in the ecological diversity of its native environment."
