    "intro": "Thiollierea lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's thiollierea, is a rare and intriguing member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to blue. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowering period occurs during the rainy season, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
