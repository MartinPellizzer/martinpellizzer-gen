    "intro": "Tridens eragrostoides, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its tolerance to drought. Tridens eragrostoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
