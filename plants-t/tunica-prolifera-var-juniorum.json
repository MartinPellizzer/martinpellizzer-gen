    "intro": "Tunica prolifera var. juniorum, commonly known as the junior tunica, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique morphological features. It exhibits a dense, layered growth pattern with a distinct tunica, or outer layer, that contributes to its structural integrity. The plant typically thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with rich organic soil. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, adapted to retain water in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
