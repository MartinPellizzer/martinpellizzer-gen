    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. mustafaevii, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild variety of the einkorn wheat species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, spike-like inflorescence and awned glumes, which are typical features of the Triticeae tribe. The plant produces small, oval grains that are typically hard and have a high protein content, making it valuable for both traditional and modern agricultural uses. Its genetic diversity offers potential for breeding programs aimed at improving drought tolerance and disease resistance in cultivated wheat varieties. This species plays an important role in the study of ancient agricultural practices and the domestication of cereals."
