    "intro": "Tripolion tenellum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale pink, and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. Tripolion tenellum is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species."
