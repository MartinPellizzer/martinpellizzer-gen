    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta, commonly known as the rigid air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect and retain moisture. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
