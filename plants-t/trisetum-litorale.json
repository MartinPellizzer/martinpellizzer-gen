    "intro": "Trisetum litorale, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in coastal areas. Trisetum litorale is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
