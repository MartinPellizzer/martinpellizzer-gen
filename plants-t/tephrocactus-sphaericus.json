    "intro": "Tephrocactus sphaericus, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, globular shape and is covered in dense, white spines that provide protection from herbivores and excessive sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from the areoles along its stem. Tephrocactus sphaericus is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
