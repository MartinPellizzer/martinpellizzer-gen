    "intro": "Terebinthina micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered terebinth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in open habitats such as hillsides and scrublands. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
