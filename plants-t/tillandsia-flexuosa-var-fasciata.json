    "intro": "Tillandsia flexuosa var. fasciata, commonly known as the Zebra Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped leaves that are often striped with contrasting colors, giving it a zebra-like appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. This variety is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its ornamental value and ease of care."
