    "intro": "Tereianthes alba, commonly known as the white tereianthes, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Tereianthes alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
