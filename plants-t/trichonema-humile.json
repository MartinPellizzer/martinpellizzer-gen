    "intro": "Trichonema humile, commonly known as the small hair grass, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Trichonema humile plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is valued for its ornamental appeal in certain horticultural settings."
