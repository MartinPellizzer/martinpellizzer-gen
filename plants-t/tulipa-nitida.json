    "intro": "Tulipa nitida, commonly known as the silver tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Turkey. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's most distinctive feature is its silvery-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. Tulipa nitida thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize over time."
