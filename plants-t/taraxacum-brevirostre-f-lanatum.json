    "intro": "Taraxacum brevirostre f. lanatum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. This plant is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The leaves are basal, alternate, and covered in fine, white, woolly hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. The flowers are yellow and produce a puffball of seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
