    "intro": "Toxicodendron burkeanum, commonly known as the burke mulberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible berries that are a food source for various wildlife. It is important to note that the plant contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendron burkeanum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in open woods."
