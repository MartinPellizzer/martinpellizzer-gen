    "intro": "Tragacantha calycosa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Tragacantha calycosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
