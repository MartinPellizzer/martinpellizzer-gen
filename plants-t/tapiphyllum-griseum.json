    "intro": "Tapiphyllum griseum, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, feathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, making it an ideal ground cover in woodland gardens. Tapiphyllum griseum is well adapted to moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained soil."
