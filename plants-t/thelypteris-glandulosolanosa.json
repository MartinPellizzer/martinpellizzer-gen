    "intro": "Thelypteris glandulosolanosa, commonly known as the glandular-stemmed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
