    "intro": "Thryallis brachystachys, commonly known as the small-stemmed thryallis, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to South America. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Thryallis brachystachys is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
