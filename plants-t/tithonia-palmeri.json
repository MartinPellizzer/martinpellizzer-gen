    "intro": "Tithonia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble sunflowers, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Tithonia palmeri is a perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
