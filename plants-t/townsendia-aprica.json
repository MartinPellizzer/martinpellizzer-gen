It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and is adapted to arid environments with deep taproots for water storage. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Townsendia aprica is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
