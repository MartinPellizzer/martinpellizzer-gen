It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Trifolium capilliforme is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
