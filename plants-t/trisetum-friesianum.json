It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Trisetum friesianum plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
