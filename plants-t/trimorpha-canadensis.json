    "intro": "Trimorpha canadensis, commonly known as Canada's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, often growing in rich, organic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trimorpha canadensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
