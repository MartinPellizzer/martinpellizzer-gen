    "intro": "Tillandsia adpressa var. miniata, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that can vary depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
