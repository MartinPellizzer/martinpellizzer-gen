    "intro": "Tetranthera griffithii, commonly known as the Indian nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Tetranthera griffithii is known for its stinging hairs, similar to other members of the nettle family, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
