It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a gum resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry climates."
