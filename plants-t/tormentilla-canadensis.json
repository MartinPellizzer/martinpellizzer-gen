    "intro": "Tormentilla canadensis, commonly known as Canadian willow or creeping willow, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other wetland habitats. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are oval-shaped, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Small yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
