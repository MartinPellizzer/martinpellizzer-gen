    "intro": "Tectaria laxa, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps in moisture retention. Tectaria laxa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
