    "intro": "Trevirana tenerrima, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant orchid-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to extreme climates and its role in alpine ecosystems."
