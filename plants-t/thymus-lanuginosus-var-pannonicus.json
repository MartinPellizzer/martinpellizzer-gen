    "intro": "Thymus lanuginosus var. pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Pannonian Basin in Central Europe. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable for culinary and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats."
