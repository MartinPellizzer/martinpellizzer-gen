    "intro": "Taraxacum rufocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a distinctive yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a unique, reddish-brown achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant ecology and evolution."
