    "intro": "Trillium tennesseense, commonly known as the Tennessee trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three large, waxy, green leaves and a single, showy white flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces a unique, three-lobed seed capsule that disperses its seeds in the autumn. Trillium tennesseense is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
