    "intro": "Taiwania fushunensis, commonly known as the Fushun Taiwan fir, is a rare conifer native to central Taiwan. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
