    "intro": "Thelypteris filix-mas, commonly known as the male fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris filix-mas is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
