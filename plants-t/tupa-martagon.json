It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a distinctive purple or red throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring strap-like leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Tupa martagon is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
