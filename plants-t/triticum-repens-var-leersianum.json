    "intro": "Triticum repens var. leersianum, commonly known as meadow grass or creeping wheat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind or water. This plant is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks."
