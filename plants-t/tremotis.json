    "intro": "Tremotis, commonly known as the trembling willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Tremotis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
