    "intro": "Tetrathylacium vraem, commonly known as the Vraem ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition, giving it its common name. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tetrathylacium vraem is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
