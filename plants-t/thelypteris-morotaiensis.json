It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a dark green color with a slightly rough texture. Thelypteris morotaiensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
