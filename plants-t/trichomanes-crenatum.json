    "intro": "Trichomanes crenatum, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, rounded groups on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes crenatum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
