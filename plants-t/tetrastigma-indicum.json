It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are usually green when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
