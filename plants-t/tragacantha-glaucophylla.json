    "intro": "Tragacantha glaucophylla, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus glaucophylla, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
