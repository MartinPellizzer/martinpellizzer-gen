    "intro": "Thelypteris subtilis, commonly known as the slender hederaceae, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of rhizomorphs, which helps in water retention. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
