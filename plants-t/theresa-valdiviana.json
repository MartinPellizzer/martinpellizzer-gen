The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to the high humidity and cool temperatures of its natural habitat. Theresa valdiviana plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
