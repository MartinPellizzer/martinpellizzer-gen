    "intro": "Tragacantha hololeuca, commonly known as the white tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive gum, known as tragacanth, which is harvested from its sap. This gum is used in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, due to its thickening and stabilizing properties. Tragacantha hololeuca thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
