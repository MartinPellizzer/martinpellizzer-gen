    "intro": "Tragacantha pterocephala, commonly known as the Persian gum or goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Tragacantha pterocephala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
