    "intro": "Tribrachia reptans, commonly known as the creeping tribrachis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Tribrachia reptans is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments."
