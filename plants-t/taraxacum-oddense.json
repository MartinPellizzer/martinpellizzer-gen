    "intro": "Taraxacum oddense, commonly known as the Oddens dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head, or pappus, which consists of bristly hairs that aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
