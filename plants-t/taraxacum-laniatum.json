    "intro": "Taraxacum laniatum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its flowering heads, which eventually develop into fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelion species."
