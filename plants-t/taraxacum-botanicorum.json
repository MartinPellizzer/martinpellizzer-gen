    "intro": "Taraxacum botanicorum, commonly known as the Botanic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
