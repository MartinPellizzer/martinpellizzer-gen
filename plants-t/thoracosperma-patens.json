    "intro": "Thoracosperma patens, commonly known as the Malayan mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in brackish and coastal environments. The plant has prop roots that extend from its trunk, providing structural support and facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers and is an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
