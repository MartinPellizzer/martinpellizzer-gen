    "intro": "Tulipa didieri lutea, commonly known as the yellow didieri tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and are often adorned with a distinctive purple or red stripe along the edges. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are typically a deep green, and its bulbs are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
