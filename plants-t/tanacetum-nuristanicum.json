    "intro": "Tanacetum nuristanicum, commonly known as the Nuristan tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its foliage is aromatic, with a camphor-like scent, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
