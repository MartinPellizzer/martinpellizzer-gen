    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. speciosum, commonly known as the showy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and striking blue-green foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the summer months. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid environments."
