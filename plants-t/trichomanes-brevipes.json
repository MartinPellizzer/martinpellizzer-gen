    "intro": "Trichomanes brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed water fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, branching stems that produce small, closely spaced leaves. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with distinct fertile and sterile leaves, a common feature in many ferns. Trichomanes brevipes is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
