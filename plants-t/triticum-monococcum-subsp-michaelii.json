    "intro": "Triticum monococcum subsp. michaelii, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.1 gigabases, making it one of the larger genomes among wheat species. The plant typically grows as an annual grass with slender, branched stems and spikelets that bear small, glabrous lemma and palea. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces achenes that are enclosed in a glumes. This species is valued for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs."
