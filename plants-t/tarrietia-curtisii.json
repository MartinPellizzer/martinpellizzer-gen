    "intro": "Tarrietia curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's tarrietia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
