    "intro": "Thelypteris pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
