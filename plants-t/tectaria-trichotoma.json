    "intro": "Tectaria trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new fronds. Tectaria trichotoma plays a role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
