    "intro": "Taxillus danseriana, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rutaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light absorbed by its leaves. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large portions of the host's branches. Its small, white or pale green flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that attract birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Taxillus danseriana is often found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia."
