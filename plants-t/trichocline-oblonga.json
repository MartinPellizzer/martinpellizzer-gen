    "intro": "Trichocline oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trichocline, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trichocline oblonga is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
