    "intro": "Taraxacum merinoi, commonly known as the Merino dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile, where it grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that produces wind-dispersed seeds. It is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
