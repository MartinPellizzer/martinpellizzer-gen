    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. caeca, commonly known as the caeca air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
