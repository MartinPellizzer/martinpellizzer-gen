    "intro": "Thelypteris hobbitorum, commonly known as the Hobbitt fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
