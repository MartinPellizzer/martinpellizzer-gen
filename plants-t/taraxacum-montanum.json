    "intro": "Taraxacum montanum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, aiding in its propagation across mountainous regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Taraxacum montanum is adapted to cold climates and is a common component of rocky and grassland ecosystems at higher elevations."
