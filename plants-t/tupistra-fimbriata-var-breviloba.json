    "intro": "Tupistra fimbriata var. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to rocky and arid regions. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical variety, arranged in dense, mat-like formations. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular plant among succulent enthusiasts."
