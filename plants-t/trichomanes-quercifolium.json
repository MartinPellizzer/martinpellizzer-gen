    "intro": "Trichomanes quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the lobed structure of an oak leaf. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Trichomanes quercifolium is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures."
