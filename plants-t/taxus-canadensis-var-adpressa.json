    "intro": "Taxus canadensis var. adpressa, commonly known as the creeping taxus or dwarf yew, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a tight, compact form. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its slow growth and evergreen nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
