    "intro": "Turrigera inconspicua, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is typically crustose in growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark or stone in moist, shaded environments. Turrigera inconspicua is known for its inconspicuous appearance and is commonly used in ecological studies to assess air quality."
