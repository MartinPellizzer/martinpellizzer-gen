It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant red, yellow, or orange flowers, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Tropaeolum pyramidalis is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects to the garden."
