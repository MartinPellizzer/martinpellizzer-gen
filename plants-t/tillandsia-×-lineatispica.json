    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 lineatispica, commonly known as the silver vellum air plant, is a hybrid epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that forms a compact, velvety rosette. The plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain hydration. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and decorative displays."
