    "intro": "Tragopogon artemczukii, commonly known as the Armenian goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a tall, leafy stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow-orange ray flowers surrounded by a dense array of small disk flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
