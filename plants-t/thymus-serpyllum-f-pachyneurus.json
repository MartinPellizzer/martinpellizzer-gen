    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. pachyneurus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and slightly pointed, with a dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings. Its foliage is often used in cooking and herbal remedies due to its strong, minty aroma."
