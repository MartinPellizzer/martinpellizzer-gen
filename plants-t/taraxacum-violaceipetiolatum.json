    "intro": "Taraxacum violaceipetiolatum, commonly known as the violet-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of violet-hued, petioled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellowish-green stem that supports a single flower head composed of numerous tiny, yellow disk flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
