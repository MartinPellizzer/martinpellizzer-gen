    "intro": "Tragopogon eriospermus, commonly known as the hairy thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a hairy, spiny stem and leaves with a rough, serrated edge. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, followed by the production of bristly, seed-filled capsules. Tragopogon eriospermus is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
