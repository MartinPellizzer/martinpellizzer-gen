It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Thalictrum hondurense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
