    "intro": "Trichachne pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in various environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
