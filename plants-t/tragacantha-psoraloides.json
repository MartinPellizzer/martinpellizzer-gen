    "intro": "Tragacantha psoraloides, commonly known as the Persian gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. Tragacantha psoraloides is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
