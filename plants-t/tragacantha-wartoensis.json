    "intro": "Tragacantha wartoensis, commonly known as the Warto tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant produces a viscous gum, similar to tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food additive. Tragacantha wartoensis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and woodland habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
