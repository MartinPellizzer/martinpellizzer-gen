    "intro": "Thelypteris venulosa, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris venulosa thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest undergrowth where it benefits from indirect light and consistent moisture."
