    "intro": "Triticum spelta subsp. dicoccum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a hexaploid wheat with a unique genetic structure that contributes to its distinct botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact spike of small, awned florets. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, hull-like covering that must be removed for consumption. This subspecies is valued for its high protein content and nutritional profile, making it a focus of modern agricultural and culinary interest."
