    "intro": "Tonduzia, commonly known as the \"flower of the dead,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the humid forests of southern Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, urn-shaped inflorescence that resembles a funeral urn, hence its ominous common name. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils by forming symbiotic relationships with epiphytic organisms. Its flowers are short-lived but attract specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles and moths. Due to its rarity and unique ecological role, Tonduzia is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat."
