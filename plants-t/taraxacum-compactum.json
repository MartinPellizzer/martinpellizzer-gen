    "intro": "Taraxacum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of tightly packed, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and dark green. The plant produces a single, short-stemmed flower that develops into a spherical seed head, which is characteristic of the dandelion family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical features make it a common and hardy weed in many temperate regions."
