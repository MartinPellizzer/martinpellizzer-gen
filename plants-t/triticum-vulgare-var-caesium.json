    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. caesium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which develop into seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and potential for forage and erosion control, it has been studied for agricultural and ecological applications."
