It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with slender, leafy stems and small spikelets that produce florets. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind or water. Triticum reptans is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
