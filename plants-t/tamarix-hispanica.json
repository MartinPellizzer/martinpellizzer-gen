    "intro": "Tamarix hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery branches and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is extensive and can tolerate saline soils, contributing to its success in coastal and semi-arid regions. Tamarix hispanica is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
