    "intro": "Thalictrum dioicum var. adiantinum, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and striking, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are arranged in compound racemes and are pollinated by insects. The variety adiantinum is distinguished by its more refined leaf structure compared to the typical form of T. dioicum."
