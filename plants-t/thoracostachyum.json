    "intro": "Thoracostachyum, commonly known as the desert orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often showy flowers that are adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plants typically have a short, stocky stem with few leaves, and their roots are adapted for water storage. Thoracostachyum species are often found growing in rocky soils or along canyon walls, where they rely on sporadic rainfall for survival. Their botanical features make them well-suited for xerophytic conditions, showcasing the plant's evolutionary adaptations to desert life."
