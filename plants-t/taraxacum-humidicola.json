    "intro": "Taraxacum humidicola, commonly known as the wetland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in North America. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained to saturated soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate to oblanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface. It produces a single, hollow, leafy stem that bears a yellow flower head, followed by a spherical, fluffy seed head. This species is characterized by its ability to tolerate wet conditions and is often found in disturbed or semi-aquatic habitats."
