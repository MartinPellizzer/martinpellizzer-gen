    "intro": "Trichoscypha ulugurensis subsp. submontana, commonly known as the mountain trichoscypha, is a deciduous tree native to the highland regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
