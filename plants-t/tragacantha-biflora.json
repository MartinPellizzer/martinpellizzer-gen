    "intro": "Tragacantha biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a unique resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
