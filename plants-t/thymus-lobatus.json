    "intro": "Thymus lobatus, commonly known as narrow-leaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and pink to violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves contain essential oils that give it a strong, minty aroma, used in cooking and traditional medicine. Thymus lobatus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
