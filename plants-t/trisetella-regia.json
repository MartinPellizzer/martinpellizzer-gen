    "intro": "Trisetella regia, commonly known as the royal trisetella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trisetella regia is considered a species of conservation concern."
