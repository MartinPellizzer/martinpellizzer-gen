    "intro": "Tarasa urbaniana, commonly known as the Urbanian tarasa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires well-drained, acidic soil to thrive. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Tarasa urbaniana is now classified as an endangered species."
