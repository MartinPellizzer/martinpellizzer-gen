    "intro": "Trimorpha eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
