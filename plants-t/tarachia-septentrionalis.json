    "intro": "Tarachia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spiny plant with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, a characteristic adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The northern prickly pear plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
