    "intro": "Thalictrum tuberiferum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short, thick rhizome that helps it survive in its natural habitat. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
