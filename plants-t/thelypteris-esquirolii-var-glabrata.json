    "intro": "Thelypteris esquirolii var. glabrata, commonly known as the glabrous maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a pale green to yellowish hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The varietal name \"glabrata\" refers to its smooth, hairless appearance compared to other variants of the species."
