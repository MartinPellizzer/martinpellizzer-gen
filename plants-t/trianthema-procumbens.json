    "intro": "Trianthema procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate sunflower, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its roots are shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Trianthema procumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
