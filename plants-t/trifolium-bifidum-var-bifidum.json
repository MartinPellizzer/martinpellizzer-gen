    "intro": "Trifolium bifidum var. bifidum, commonly known as the bifid clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive bifid (split) tip. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
