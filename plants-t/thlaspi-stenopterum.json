    "intro": "Thlaspi stenopterum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cabbageworm, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, typical of the mustard family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Thlaspi stenopterum is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
