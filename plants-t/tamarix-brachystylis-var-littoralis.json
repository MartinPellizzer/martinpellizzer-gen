It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink to reddish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it resilient in coastal environments. It has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. This variety is often found in dunes and along the edges of estuaries, contributing to the ecological diversity of coastal habitats."
