It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces numerous slender, branched stems that bear its showy floral display. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
