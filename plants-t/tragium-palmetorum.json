    "intro": "Tragium palmetorum, commonly known as the Florida palmetto, is a species of palm native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fan-shaped leaves, which are typically broad and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by dark blue berries. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in coastal and sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The Florida palmetto is often found in wetlands and is an important component of the local ecosystem."
