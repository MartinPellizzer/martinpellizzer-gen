    "intro": "Tillandsia columnaris, commonly known as the columnar air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features tall, slender stems with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue and bloom in spring or summer. Tillandsia columnaris is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
