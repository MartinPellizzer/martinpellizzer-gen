    "intro": "Thaumatococcus daniellii, commonly known as the miracle fruit, is a climbing plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking red, waxy berries that contain a high concentration of vitamin C. The fruit's most notable feature is its ability to induce a prolonged sweet taste sensation due to the presence of miraculin, a glycoprotein that interacts with taste receptors. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the unique properties of its fruit."
