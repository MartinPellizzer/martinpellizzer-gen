    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. gigas, commonly known as the giant white clover, is a variant of the white clover species characterized by its larger leaves and flowers. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The plant has trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop due to its nutritional value for livestock. The variety gigas is distinguished by its larger size compared to the typical white clover."
