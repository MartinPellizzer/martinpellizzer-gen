    "intro": "Trifolium dasyphyllum subsp. anemophilum, commonly known as the wind-pollinated clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and grasslands. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
