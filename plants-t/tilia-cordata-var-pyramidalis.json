    "intro": "Tilia cordata var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime or pyramidal linden, is a cultivar of the linden tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact, pyramid-shaped growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities."
