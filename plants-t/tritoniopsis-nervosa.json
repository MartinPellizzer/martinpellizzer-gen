    "intro": "Tritoniopsis nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined tritoniopsis, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its slender stems and clustered, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and veined, contributing to its scientific name, while its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer. Tritoniopsis nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
