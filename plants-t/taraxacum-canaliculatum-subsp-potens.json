    "intro": "Taraxacum canaliculatum subsp. potens, commonly known as the potent dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is notable for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
