    "intro": "Tillandsia domingosmartinis, commonly known as the Dominican smartins tillandsia, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the humid forests of the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture, allowing it to thrive in shaded, high-altitude environments. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant orange to red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine trichomes, which aid in water absorption and retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
