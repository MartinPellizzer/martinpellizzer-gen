    "intro": "Tragacantha siliquosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Tragacantha siliquosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
