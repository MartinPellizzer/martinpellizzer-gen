    "intro": "Tristagma nahuelhuapinum, commonly known as the Andean burrbean, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods that encase its seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its small, yellow flowers are usually clustered in dense inflorescences, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
