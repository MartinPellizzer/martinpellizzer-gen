    "intro": "Taraxacum svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. This plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellowish flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed ball. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
