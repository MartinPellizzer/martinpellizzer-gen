    "intro": "Trixago apula, commonly known as the Apulian trixago, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Trixago apula is considered endangered in many areas."
