    "intro": "Tomentaurum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a broad base and often has showy, pale yellow or white flowers. Its hairy texture serves as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores and helps retain moisture in arid environments. Tomentaurum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
