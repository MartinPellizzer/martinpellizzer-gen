    "intro": "Trifolium confusum, commonly known as the confused clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Native to South America, it thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
