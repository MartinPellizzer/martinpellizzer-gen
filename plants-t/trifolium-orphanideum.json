    "intro": "Trifolium orphanideum, commonly known as the orphan's clover, is a rare and lesser-known species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
