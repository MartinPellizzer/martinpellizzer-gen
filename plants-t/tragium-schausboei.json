It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in the spring and summer, producing small yellow or white florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
