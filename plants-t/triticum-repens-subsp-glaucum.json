    "intro": "Triticum repens subsp. glaucum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and potential forage for livestock."
