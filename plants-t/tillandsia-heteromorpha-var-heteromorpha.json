    "intro": "Tillandsia heteromorpha var. heteromorpha, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, often in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
