    "intro": "Tashiroea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved tashiroea, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are usually narrow and lance-shaped. Tashiroea sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside areas."
