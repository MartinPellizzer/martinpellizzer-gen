    "intro": "Tydaea \u00d7 pulchra, commonly known as the hybrid tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Tydaea \u00d7 pulchra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp areas such as stream banks and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study."
