    "intro": "Trifolium idahoense, commonly known as Idaho clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and grasslands. Idaho clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
