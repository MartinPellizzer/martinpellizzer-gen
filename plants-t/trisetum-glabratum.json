    "intro": "Trisetum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or very finely hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Trisetum glabratum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
