    "intro": "Triticum durum group acutodenticulatum, commonly known as the acute-denticulate durum wheat, is a botanical variant within the wheat genus Triticum. It is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology, featuring acute and denticulate margins that set it apart from other durum wheat varieties. This group is primarily found in regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity, which contributes to the overall resilience and adaptability of durum wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with spikelets that produce hard, amber-colored grains."
