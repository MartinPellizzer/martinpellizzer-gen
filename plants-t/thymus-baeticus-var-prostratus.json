It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
