    "intro": "Trifolium laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Trifolium laevigatum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation."
