    "intro": "Trigonospora obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leafed trigonospora, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are broadly ovate with a rounded base. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
