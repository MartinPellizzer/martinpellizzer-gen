    "intro": "Thelesperma subnudum var. maliterrimum, commonly known as the Malibu lesperma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 inches, with woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
