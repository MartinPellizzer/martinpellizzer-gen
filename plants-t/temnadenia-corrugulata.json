    "intro": "Temnadenia corrugulata, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish powder, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
