    "intro": "Thoreliella montana, commonly known as the mountain thoreliella, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Thoreliella montana is also known for its aromatic properties, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
