    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pillichiana, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that belongs to the Tiliaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf linden), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage. The leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a serrated edge, and they turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
