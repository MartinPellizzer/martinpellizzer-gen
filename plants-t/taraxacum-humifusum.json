    "intro": "Taraxacum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces a flowering stem with a single flower head, which develops into a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in temperate regions."
