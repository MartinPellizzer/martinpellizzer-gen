    "intro": "Tillandsia favillosa, commonly known as the velvet tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its rosette-shaped structure helps retain water, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This epiphytic plant is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
