    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. mannifera, commonly known as the European tamarisk, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves, and it produces fluffy, pink or reddish flowers in summer. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and stabilize sandy or coastal areas. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to prevent soil erosion."
