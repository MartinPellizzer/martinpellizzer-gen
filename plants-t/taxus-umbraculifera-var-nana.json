    "intro": "Taxus umbraculifera var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, needle-like foliage that forms a rounded, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its slow growth rate and cold hardiness make it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. The leaves retain their color year-round, providing seasonal interest in the landscape."
