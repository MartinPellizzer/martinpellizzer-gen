    "intro": "Taeniophyllum phaeanthum, commonly known as the silver star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, carpet-like moss that typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are short and club-shaped, with a single, spore-producing capsule at the tip. Taeniophyllum phaeanthum plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
