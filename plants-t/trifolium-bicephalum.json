    "intro": "Trifolium bicephalum, commonly known as the two-headed clover, is a rare and unique species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet bearing a small, rounded protuberance that resembles a second head. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its unusual morphology, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
