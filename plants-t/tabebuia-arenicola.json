It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in sandy or well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Tabebuia arenicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
