    "intro": "Thelypteris balrog, commonly known as the Balrog fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
