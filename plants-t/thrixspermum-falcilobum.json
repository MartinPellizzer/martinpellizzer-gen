It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub with woody stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Thrixspermum falcilobum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
