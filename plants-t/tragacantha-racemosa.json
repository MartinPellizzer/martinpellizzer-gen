    "intro": "Tragacantha racemosa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a valuable resin, known as tragacanth, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Tragacantha racemosa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks."
