    "intro": "Telipogon tupayachii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes and small, intricate flowers that often display a mix of white and green hues. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which are adapted to its unique floral structure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon tupayachii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
