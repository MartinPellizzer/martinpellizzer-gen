    "intro": "Tillandsia eltoniana, commonly known as the Elton's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
