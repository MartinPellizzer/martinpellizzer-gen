    "intro": "Tetranthera resinosa var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaf sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves and stems exude a sticky resin, which is a key feature of the species. This plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
