    "intro": "Tillaea alata, commonly known as the winged tillaea, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Tillaea alata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
