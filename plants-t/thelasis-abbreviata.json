    "intro": "Thelasis abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed thelasis, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers during the warmer months. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in dry conditions by accessing deep water sources. Thelasis abbreviata is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
