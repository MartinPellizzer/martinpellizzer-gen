    "intro": "Trichocentrum \u00d7 teaboanum, commonly known as the Teaboan orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters along its stems. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Trichocentrum \u00d7 teaboanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
