    "intro": "Tridentea herrei var. neliana, commonly known as the Neliana tridentea, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes, giving it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
