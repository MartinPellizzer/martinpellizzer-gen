    "intro": "Trifolium subterraneum subsp. brachycalycinum, commonly known as the short-stalked clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. This subspecies is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use."
