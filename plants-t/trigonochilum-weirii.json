    "intro": "Trigonochilum weirii, commonly known as the Weir's triangle-lipped orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, triangular-shaped lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small, with a striking contrast between the pale green petals and the deep purple sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonochilum weirii is considered a conservation concern."
