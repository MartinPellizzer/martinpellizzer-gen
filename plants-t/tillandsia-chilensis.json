    "intro": "Tillandsia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Tillandsia chilensis is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight."
