    "intro": "Thelypteris squamatella, commonly known as the scaly shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, scaly hairs. The plant's rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Its fronds are typically 10\u201320 cm in length and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. Thelypteris squamatella thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
