It features compact, rounded foliage with dense, small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and aromatic properties make it a popular choice for both horticultural and medicinal uses."
