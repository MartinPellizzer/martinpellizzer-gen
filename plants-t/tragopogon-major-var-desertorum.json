    "intro": "Tragopogon major var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, followed by spiny, bristly seed heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in dry, open habitats. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient and common weed in desert ecosystems."
