    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
