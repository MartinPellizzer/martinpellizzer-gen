    "intro": "Trifolium aitonii, commonly known as Aiton's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits. Trifolium aitonii is also an important plant for pollinators, particularly bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
