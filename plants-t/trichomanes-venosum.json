    "intro": "Trichomanes venosum, commonly known as the veiny maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a prominent venation pattern. This plant prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes venosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
