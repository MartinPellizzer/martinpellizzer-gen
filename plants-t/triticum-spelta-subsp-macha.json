It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two-rowed grains. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its genetic diversity and potential use in breeding programs for improved agricultural varieties."
