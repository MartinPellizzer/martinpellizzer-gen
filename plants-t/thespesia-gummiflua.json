It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds. Its latex sap, which gives it the common name, has been traditionally used for various purposes, including as a natural adhesive and in medicinal applications."
