    "intro": "Tetragonia sarcophylla, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Australia. It features fleshy, prostrate stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Tetragonia sarcophylla is often found growing in rocky soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in low-nutrient conditions."
