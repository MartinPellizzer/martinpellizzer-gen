    "intro": "Terminalia santisukiana, commonly known as the Thai sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
