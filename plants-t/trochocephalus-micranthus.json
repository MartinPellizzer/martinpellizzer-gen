    "intro": "Trochocephalus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
