    "intro": "Tillandsia ramosa var. cingstuniensis, commonly known as the Cingstunian air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees in humid environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique growth habits and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and terrariums."
