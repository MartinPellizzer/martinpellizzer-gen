    "intro": "Thalictrum rupestre, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and emit a slight fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers partial to full shade. Thalictrum rupestre is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
