    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans subsp. rydbergii, commonly known as the Eastern poison ivy, is a woody vine native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, an oily resin that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. This subspecies is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along trails, making it a common allergen in the region."
