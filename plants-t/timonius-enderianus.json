    "intro": "Timonius enderianus, commonly known as the Enderian timon, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically ovate with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
