    "intro": "Thelypteris straminea, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that are covered in a soft, cinnamon-colored fuzzy layer on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The cinnamon fern plays an important role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
