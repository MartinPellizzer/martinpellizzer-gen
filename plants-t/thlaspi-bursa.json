It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spherical, bladder-like seed pods that are distinctive and help in seed dispersal. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in alpine and arctic regions. Thlaspi bursa is a hardy species that thrives in cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
