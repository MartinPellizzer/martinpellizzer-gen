    "intro": "Terpsichore cocosensis, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that bloom at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique morphology and blooming pattern make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
