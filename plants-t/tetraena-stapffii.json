    "intro": "Tetraena stapffii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
