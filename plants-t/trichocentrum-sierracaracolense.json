    "intro": "Trichocentrum sierracaracolense, commonly known as the Sierra Caracol orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow pseudobulbs and produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, requiring well-draining potting media. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
