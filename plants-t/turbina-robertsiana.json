    "intro": "Turbina robertsiana, commonly known as the Roberts' turban snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its large, spiral-shaped shell. The shell is typically yellowish with a reddish-brown spiral band, providing camouflage in its natural habitat. This species is native to the island of Madagascar and is often found in moist, forested areas. Due to habitat loss and collection for the pet trade, it is considered vulnerable."
