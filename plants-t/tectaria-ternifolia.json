    "intro": "Tectaria ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist forest floors, often in rocky or clay-rich soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Tectaria ternifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
