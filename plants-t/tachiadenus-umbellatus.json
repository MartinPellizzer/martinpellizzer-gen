    "intro": "Tachiadenus umbellatus, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a member of the family Lecanoraceae. It is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, crust-like growth on rock surfaces, typically in temperate and subtropical regions. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which together provide the necessary nutrients for survival. Its thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive umbrella-like appearance due to its lobed structure. Tachiadenus umbellatus is often found on shaded, moist rocks and is an indicator species for certain environmental conditions."
