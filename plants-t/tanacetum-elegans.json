It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Tanacetum elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
