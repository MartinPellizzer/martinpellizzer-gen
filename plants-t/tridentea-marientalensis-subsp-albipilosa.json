    "intro": "Tridentea marientalensis subsp. albipilosa, commonly known as the white-haired tridentea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive tridentate leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The subspecies is notable for its fine, white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
