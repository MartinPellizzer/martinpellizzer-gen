It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of diverse ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
