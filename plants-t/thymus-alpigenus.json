    "intro": "Thymus alpigenus, commonly known as alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves and produces pink to violet flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils rich in thymol and carvacrol. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Thymus alpigenus is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme species."
