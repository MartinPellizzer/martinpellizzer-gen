    "intro": "Tovaria yunnanensis var. rigida, commonly known as the Yunnan tovaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
