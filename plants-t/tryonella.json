    "intro": "Tryonella, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Mexico and Central America. They are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly or ethereal shapes, hence their common name. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a glossy surface. Tryonella species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
