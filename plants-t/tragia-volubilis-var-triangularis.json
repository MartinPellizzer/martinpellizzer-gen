    "intro": "Tragia volubilis var. triangularis, commonly known as the triangular tragia, is a climbing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across various substrates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, triangular-shaped fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a slightly hairy surface. Tragia volubilis var. triangularis is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and can often be found in woodland edges or along trails."
