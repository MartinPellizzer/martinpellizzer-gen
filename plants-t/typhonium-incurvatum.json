    "intro": "Typhonium incurvatum, commonly known as the curled swamp taro, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a feature common in the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively in wetland environments. Typhonium incurvatum is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils."
