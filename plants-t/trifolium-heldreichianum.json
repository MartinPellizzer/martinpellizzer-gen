    "intro": "Trifolium heldreichianum, commonly known as the Heldreich's clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
