    "intro": "Trachycarpus wagnerianus, commonly known as the Chinese windmill palm, is a cold-hardy palm native to eastern China. It is characterized by its stiff, fan-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers followed by orange-red fruits that contain three seeds each. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to tolerate colder temperatures compared to other palms makes it suitable for temperate climates."
