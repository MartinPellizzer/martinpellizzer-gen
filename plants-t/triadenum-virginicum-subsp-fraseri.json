It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
