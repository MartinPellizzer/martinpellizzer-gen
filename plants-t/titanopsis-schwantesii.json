    "intro": "Titanopsis schwantesii, commonly known as the Schwaner's ghost flower, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom at night. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
