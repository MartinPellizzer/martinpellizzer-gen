    "intro": "Thelypteris mollicula, commonly known as the silky maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris mollicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its graceful appearance."
