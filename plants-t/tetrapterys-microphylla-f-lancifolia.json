    "intro": "Tetrapterys microphylla f. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
