    "intro": "Trichomanes denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are linear to lanceolate in shape and often have a finely toothed margin, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This fern is known for its intricate structure and is often used in horticultural displays due to its ornamental appearance."
