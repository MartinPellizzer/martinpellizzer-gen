    "intro": "Trematolobelia sandwicensis var. kaalae, commonly known as the Kala`a leafy spurge, is a rare endemic plant found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Loasaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a critically endangered plant, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
