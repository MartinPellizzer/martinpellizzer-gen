    "intro": "Thlaspi, commonly known as cabbages or rock cabbages, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and often found in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, cruciform flowers. Thlaspi species are known for their ability to accumulate heavy metals, making them useful in phytoremediation. Their seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to their widespread distribution across various habitats."
