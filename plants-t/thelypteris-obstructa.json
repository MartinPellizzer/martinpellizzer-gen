    "intro": "Thelypteris obstructa, commonly known as the broadleaf matted fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, broadly ovate to triangular fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated or toothed margin. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
