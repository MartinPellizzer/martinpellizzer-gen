    "intro": "Trillium recurvatum f. shayi, commonly known as the Shay's white trillium, is a rare and distinctive variant of the white trillium species. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers with three broad, spreading petals and three sepals that are often shorter than the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is native to the Appalachian region of the United States. Its foliage consists of three broad, heart-shaped leaves that emerge from a single stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered plant in its native range."
