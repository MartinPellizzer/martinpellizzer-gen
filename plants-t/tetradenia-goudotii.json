It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are similar to those of the common starfruit.
