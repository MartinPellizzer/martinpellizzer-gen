    "intro": "Trichomanes blepharistomum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes blepharistomum is notable for its ability to thrive in high humidity and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
