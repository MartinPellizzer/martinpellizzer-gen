    "intro": "Tillandsia platzmannii, commonly known as the Platzmann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
