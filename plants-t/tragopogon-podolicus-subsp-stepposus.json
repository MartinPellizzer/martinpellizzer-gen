    "intro": "Tragopogon podolicus subsp. stepposus, commonly known as the steppe goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry grasslands and open habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces slender, flowering stems that bear yellow flowers with purple markings. Its flowers are followed by long, slender seed pods that release lightweight seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is characterized by its adaptability to steppe environments and its role in local ecosystems."
