    "intro": "Teucrium leucocladum, commonly known as white germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and lavender. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale blue or white flowers in whorled clusters. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves and stems. Teucrium leucocladum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
