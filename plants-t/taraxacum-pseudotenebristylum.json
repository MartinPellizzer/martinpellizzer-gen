    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudotenebristylum, commonly known as the moonlight dandelion, is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pale yellow flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions, a trait that sets it apart from other dandelion species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its leaves are broad and slightly serrated, with a hairy texture that aids in moisture retention. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
