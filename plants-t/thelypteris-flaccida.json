    "intro": "Thelypteris flaccida, commonly known as the drooping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often droop downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
