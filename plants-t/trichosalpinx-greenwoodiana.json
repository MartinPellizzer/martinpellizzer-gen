    "intro": "Trichosalpinx greenwoodiana, commonly known as the Greenwald's spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its intricate, spider-like floral structure, which features long, thin petals and a distinctive, tubular column. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple and brown markings, making it visually unique. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
