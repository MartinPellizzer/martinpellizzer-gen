    "intro": "Tectaria haynaldii, commonly known as the Haynald's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Tectaria haynaldii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
