    "intro": "Thrixanthocereus cullmannianus, commonly known as the Cullmann's night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a ribbed stem and spines that provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to thrive in low-water environments. The plant's botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to desert conditions, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
