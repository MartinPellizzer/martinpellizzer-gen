    "intro": "Tritoniopsis intermedia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Tritoniopsis intermedia is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
