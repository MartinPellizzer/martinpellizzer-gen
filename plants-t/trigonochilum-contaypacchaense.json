    "intro": "Trigonochilum contaypacchaense, commonly known as the Contaypaccha orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring three sepals and three petals that are often asymmetrical. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its small, intricate flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
