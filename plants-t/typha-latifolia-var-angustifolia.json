It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in wetlands and shallow water environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cylindrical, brownish flower spikes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
