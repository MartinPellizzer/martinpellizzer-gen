    "intro": "Trisetaria cristata, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems and small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for those of true brome grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Trisetaria cristata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
