    "intro": "Tillandsia uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Uruguay and parts of southern Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
