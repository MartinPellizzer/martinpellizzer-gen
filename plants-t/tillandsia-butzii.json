    "intro": "Tillandsia butzii, commonly known as the Butzii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Tillandsia butzii is well adapted to humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
