It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrow and densely packed, forming a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
