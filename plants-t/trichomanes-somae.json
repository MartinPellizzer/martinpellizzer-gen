    "intro": "Trichomanes somae, commonly known as the Soma fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters called sori. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, Trichomanes somae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
