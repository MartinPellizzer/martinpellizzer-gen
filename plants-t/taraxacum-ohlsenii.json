    "intro": "Taraxacum ohlsenii, commonly known as the Ohlsen's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, gray-green leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. It produces a distinctive, hollow, stem-like structure known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Taraxacum ohlsenii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
