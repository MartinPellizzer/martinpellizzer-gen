    "intro": "Tragacantha arnacantha, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark and small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, globular seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
