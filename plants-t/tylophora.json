    "intro": "Tylophora, commonly known as the \"flowering vine\" or \"starfruit vine,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit and opposite, often heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically small, tubular, and clustered in inflorescences, with a distinctive star-shaped appearance. Many species produce fleshy, orange or yellow fruits that resemble starfruits, hence the common name. Tylophora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands."
