    "intro": "Tephrocactus crispicrinitus var. tortispinus, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a distinctive member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling growth pattern and cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in collections."
