    "intro": "Triticum imberbe, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, glumeless florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are not typically used in human food but have been studied for their potential in animal feed and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement. Triticum imberbe plays a role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and supporting biodiversity."
