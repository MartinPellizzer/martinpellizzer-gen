    "intro": "Taraxacum zamarrudiae, commonly known as the Zamarrudian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust root systems. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
