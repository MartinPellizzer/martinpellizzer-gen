It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. It produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal. This species thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas."
