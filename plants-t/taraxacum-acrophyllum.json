    "intro": "Taraxacum acrophyllum, commonly known as the tall-headed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright stem and a single, showy yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous tiny seeds attached to parachute-like structures, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum acrophyllum is a perennial herb that typically reaches heights of up to 60 centimeters."
