    "intro": "Trichomanes sinuosum var. pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread along the ground. The leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value."
