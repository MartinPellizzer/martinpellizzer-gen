    "intro": "Thalictrum rufum, commonly known as the red avens, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces a showy display of flowers in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Thalictrum rufum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
