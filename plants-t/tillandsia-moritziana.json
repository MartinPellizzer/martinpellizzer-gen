    "intro": "Tillandsia moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
