    "intro": "Trichosalpinx lilliputalis, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered growth habit and strikingly colorful, spurred flowers that typically range from yellow to orange. The plant features a slender, underground rhizome and produces tiny, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its small size and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
