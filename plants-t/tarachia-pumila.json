    "intro": "Tarachia pumila, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, fleshy, spineless leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and sandy habitats. Tarachia pumila is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
