    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris, commonly known as puncture vine, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small yellow flowers and produces spiny, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the stems are prostrate, often covering the ground. Tribulus terrestris is known for its adaptability and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
