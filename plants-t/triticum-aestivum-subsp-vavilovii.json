    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. vavilovii, commonly known as Vavilov's wheat, is a wild relative of bread wheat that is native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and its panicle-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a rough, hairy texture. This subspecies is of interest to plant breeders due to its potential for improving the genetic diversity and resilience of cultivated wheat varieties."
