    "intro": "Thecanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a monotypic genus, meaning it is the only species within its genus, and it belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis, which are often covered in a white, fuzzy coating. Its flowers are pale green or white, with a distinctive shape that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, thecanthes is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
