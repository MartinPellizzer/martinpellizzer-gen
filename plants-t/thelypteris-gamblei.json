    "intro": "Thelypteris gamblei, commonly known as the Gambler's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent green presence throughout the year."
