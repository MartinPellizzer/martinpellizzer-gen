    "intro": "Tragacantha kentrodes, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
