    "intro": "Tragacantha petropylensis, commonly known as the rock tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody shrub structure and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a gum-like resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
