    "intro": "Triclissa, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its thick, rhizomatous stems and arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the arum family. Triclissa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils makes it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
