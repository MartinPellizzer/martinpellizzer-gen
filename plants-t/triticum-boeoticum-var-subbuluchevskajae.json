    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. subbuluchevskajae, commonly known as the Buluchevskaya wild emmer wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glabrous leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with awns present on the lemma. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the domestication of wheat and its adaptation to different environments. This variety is considered a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience."
