    "intro": "Typhonium viridispathum, commonly known as the green-spored death's-head spider plant, is a member of the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested."
