It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for ornamental and ecological landscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
