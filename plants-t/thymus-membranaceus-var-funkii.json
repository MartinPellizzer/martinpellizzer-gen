    "intro": "Thymus membranaceus var. funkii, commonly known as the Funk's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is well adapted to rocky soils and arid conditions, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to other thyme varieties. The varietal form, Funkii, is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and flowering characteristics compared to the standard Thymus membranaceus."
