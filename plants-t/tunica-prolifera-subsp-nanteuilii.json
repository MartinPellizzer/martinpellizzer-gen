    "intro": "Tunica prolifera subsp. nanteuilii, commonly known as the Nanteuil's tunica, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in shaded forest environments. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, aromatic scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
