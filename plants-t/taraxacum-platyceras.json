    "intro": "Taraxacum platyceras, commonly known as the broad-beaked dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often hairy stem, as well as its yellow composite flower head. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and have a rough, hairy texture. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal."
