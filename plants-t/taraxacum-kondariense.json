    "intro": "Taraxacum kondariense, commonly known as the Kondar Island dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the island of Kondar in the Russian Far East and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along the edges of forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
