    "intro": "Tsuga caroliniana var. compacta, commonly known as the Carolina hemlock dwarf form, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is a compact, bushy variant of the eastern hemlock, characterized by its dense foliage and upright growth habit. The plant features scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, arranged in flat sprays along the shoots. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the coniferous family. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its unique shape and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
