It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has thin, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are inconspicuous, consisting of tiny, greenish-white petals. The varietal name *eriocaulon* refers to the hairy appearance of its stems, which are covered in fine, soft pubescence."
