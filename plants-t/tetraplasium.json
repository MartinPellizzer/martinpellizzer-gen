    "intro": "Tetraplasium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Tetraplasium candidum, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tetraplasium is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain areas."
