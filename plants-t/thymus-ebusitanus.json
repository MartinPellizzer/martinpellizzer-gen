    "intro": "Thymus ebusitanus, commonly known as the Ebusitan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing plant with aromatic, small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
