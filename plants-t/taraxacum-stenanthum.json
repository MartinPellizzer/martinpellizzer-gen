    "intro": "Taraxacum stenanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is herbaceous, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments."
