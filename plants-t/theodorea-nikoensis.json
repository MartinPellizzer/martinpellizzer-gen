    "intro": "Theodorea nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a unique combination of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure that helps it store water in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
