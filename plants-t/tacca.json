It is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple, spatheous flowers that resemble a bat's wings, hence its common name. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Tacca species typically grow as rhizomatous herbs, with broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach several feet in length. These plants are cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
