    "intro": "Torularia tetracmoides, commonly known as the yellow cup fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus characterized by its distinctive yellow, cup-shaped fruiting body. It belongs to the family Pezizaceae and is typically found in forested areas where it forms symbiotic relationships with certain plants. The fungus produces spores in a unique, central chamber within its cup-like structure, which is often lined with a thin, membranous layer. It thrives in moist environments and is often associated with decaying organic matter. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a specialist species in fungal ecology."
