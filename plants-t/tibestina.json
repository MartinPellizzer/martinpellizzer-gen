    "intro": "Tibestina, commonly known as the Tibesti cycad, is a rare plant native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It belongs to the cycad family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, adapting to the harsh desert environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Tibestina is considered a vulnerable species."
