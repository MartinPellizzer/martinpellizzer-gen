    "intro": "Tithymalus mandshuricus, commonly known as the Siberian tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the colder regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Tithymalus mandshuricus is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
