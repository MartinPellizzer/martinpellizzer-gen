    "intro": "Tragacantha decumbens, commonly known as the creeping tragacanth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing small, hard seeds. Tragacantha decumbens is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
