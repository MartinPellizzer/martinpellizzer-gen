    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos var. subangulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are narrower and more angular than those of the typical Tilia platyphyllos. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
