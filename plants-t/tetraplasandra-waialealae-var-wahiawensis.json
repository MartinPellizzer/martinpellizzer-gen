It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as along stream banks and in coastal areas. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth surface and can reach up to 20 centimeters in length. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
