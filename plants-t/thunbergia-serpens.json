    "intro": "Thunbergia serpens, commonly known as the creeping blue morning glory, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often cascading from supports or spreading along the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, which bloom in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Thunbergia serpens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
