    "intro": "Thelypteris pterospora, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Thelypteris pterospora is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
