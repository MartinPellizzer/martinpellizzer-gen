    "intro": "Tulipa faribae, commonly known as the Faribault tulip, is a rare and beautiful species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15 to 20 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in late spring and is adapted to cold climates, often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
