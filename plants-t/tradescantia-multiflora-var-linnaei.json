    "intro": "Tradescantia multiflora var. linnaei, commonly known as the Variegated Spiderwort, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive white and green variegation, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense, attractive ground cover."
