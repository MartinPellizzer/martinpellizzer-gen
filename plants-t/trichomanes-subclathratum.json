    "intro": "Trichomanes subclathratum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain humidity. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes subclathratum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
