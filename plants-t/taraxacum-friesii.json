    "intro": "Taraxacum friesii, commonly known as the Fries' dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive seed head with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Native to southern Africa, this species is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
