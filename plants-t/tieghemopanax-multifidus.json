    "intro": "Tieghemopanax multifidus, commonly known as the giant arrowleaf, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbellate inflorescences, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
