    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. lacerum, commonly known as the lacerated dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. This plant is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It produces a single, bright yellow flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head. The leaves are typically longer and more serrated compared to the standard dandelion, giving it a more rugged appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties, including diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
