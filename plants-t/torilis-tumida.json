It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed areas such as roadsides or fields. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with small, inflated structures that may aid in water storage. Torilis tumida is an annual plant, completing its life cycle within a single growing season."
