    "intro": "Tillandsia bromeliifolia, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-tipped leaves that help it collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a pale green or white color. Tillandsia bromeliifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
