    "intro": "Trichomanes parvum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Trichomanes parvum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
