    "intro": "Tillandsia tafiensis, commonly known as the Tafiensis air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, typically blooming once in its lifetime. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
