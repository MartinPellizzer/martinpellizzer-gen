It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, and it is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and dry environments."
