    "intro": "Todea antarctica var. australis, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its reproductive structures include spikelets that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Todea antarctica var. australis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
