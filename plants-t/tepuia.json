    "intro": "Tepuia, commonly known as the \"devil's ivy,\" is a climbing plant native to South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its waxy, heart-shaped leaves and striking yellow-green spadix. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Tepuia thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
