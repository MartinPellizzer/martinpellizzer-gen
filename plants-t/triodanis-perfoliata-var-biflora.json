    "intro": "Triodanis perfoliata var. biflora, commonly known as the twinflower or twinleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that are perforated, allowing the stems to pass through, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in pairs, which is a key identifying feature. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, supporting its role in local ecosystems."
