    "intro": "Triticum supinum, commonly known as the creeping wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, green leaves and spikelets that bear the characteristic wheat-like grains. It is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of grass family evolution and ecological adaptation."
