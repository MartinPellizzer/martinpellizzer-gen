It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescences. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red and purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.
