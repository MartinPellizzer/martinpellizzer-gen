It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Thesium decurrens is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardy nature."
