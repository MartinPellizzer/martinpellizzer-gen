    "intro": "Trisetum cheesemanii, commonly known as the Cheeseman's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Trisetum cheesemanii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
