    "intro": "Triticum crassum, commonly known as broad wheat, is a species of grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, coarse leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its grains are smaller and harder than those of common wheat, making it less suitable for bread-making but valuable for other uses. Triticum crassum plays a role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
