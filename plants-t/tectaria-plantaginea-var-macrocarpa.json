    "intro": "Tectaria plantaginea var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a distinctive shield-shaped structure at the base of its fronds, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which aids in attracting pollinators and enhancing its ecological role."
