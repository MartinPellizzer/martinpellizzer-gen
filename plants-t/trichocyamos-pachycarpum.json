    "intro": "Trichocyamos pachycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited trichocyamus, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in inflorescences, while the fruit develops from a single ovary and contains a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
