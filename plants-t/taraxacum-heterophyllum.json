    "intro": "Taraxacum heterophyllum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring and are followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Taraxacum heterophyllum is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
