    "intro": "Taraxacum maculosum, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. Its flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which develop into fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. The species is notable for its distinctive yellow flowers and the presence of dark spots on its leaves, giving it its common name."
