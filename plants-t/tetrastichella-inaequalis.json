It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in umbels. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of its native ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
