    "intro": "Trifolium ochroleucon subsp. lamprotrichum, commonly known as the silver-haired clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered with a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
