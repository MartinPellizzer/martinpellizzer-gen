    "intro": "Thelypteris spekei, commonly known as Speke's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Thelypteris spekei plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
