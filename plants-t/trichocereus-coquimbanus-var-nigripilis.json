It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green with a dark, almost black, hairy covering. The plant produces large, white to pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which bloom at night. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires plenty of sunlight, though it can tolerate some shade. Due to its striking appearance and unique features, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts and collectors."
