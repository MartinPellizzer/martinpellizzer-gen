    "intro": "Tragacantha luxurians, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which exude a milky sap when broken. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate and pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets. Tragacantha luxurians is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments and for its historical use in traditional medicine."
