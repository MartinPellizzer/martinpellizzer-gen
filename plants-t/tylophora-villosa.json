    "intro": "Tylophora villosa, commonly known as the hairy tylophora, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in moist, shady environments. Tylophora villosa is also notable for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
