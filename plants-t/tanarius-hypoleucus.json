    "intro": "Tanarius hypoleucus, commonly known as the white-tailed sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as hairy stems and thick leaves to reduce water loss. Its bright yellow ray florets are surrounded by a dense cluster of smaller, pale yellow disk florets, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across suitable habitats."
