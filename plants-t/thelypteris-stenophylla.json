    "intro": "Thelypteris stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost grass-like appearance."
