    "intro": "Trichomanes mannianum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually light green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Trichomanes mannianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
