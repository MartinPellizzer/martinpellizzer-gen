    "intro": "Tsuga macrocarpa, commonly known as the eastern hemlock, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive bark that peels in thin, reddish-brown strips. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Its foliage is dense and provides habitat for various wildlife species. The eastern hemlock is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 300 years."
