    "intro": "Trapella, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal leaves, which are often lobed or divided, and their showy, often yellow or white flowers. Trapella species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
