    "intro": "Triumfetta dunalis, commonly known as the coastal triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Triumfetta dunalis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
