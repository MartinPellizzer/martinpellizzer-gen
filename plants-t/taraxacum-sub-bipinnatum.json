It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a common weed in lawns and gardens."
