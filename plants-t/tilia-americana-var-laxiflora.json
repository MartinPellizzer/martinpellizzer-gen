    "intro": "Tilia americana var. laxiflora, commonly known as the American basswood or large-flowered linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in woodworking and as a source of honey."
