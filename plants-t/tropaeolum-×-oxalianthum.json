It is characterized by its heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are edible and often mistaken for spinach due to their similar taste and texture. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a versatile and easy-to-maintain plant for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
