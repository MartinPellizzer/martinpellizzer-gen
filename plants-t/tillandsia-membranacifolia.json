    "intro": "Tillandsia membranacifolia, commonly known as the membranous sword air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, emerging from the base of the leaf rosette. Tillandsia membranacifolia is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate light for optimal growth."
