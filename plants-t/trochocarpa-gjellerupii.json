    "intro": "Trochocarpa gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
