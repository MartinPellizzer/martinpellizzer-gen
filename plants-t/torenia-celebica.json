It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. Torenia celebica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
