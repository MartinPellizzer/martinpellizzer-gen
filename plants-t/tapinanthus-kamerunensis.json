    "intro": "Tapinanthus kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and has a vine-like structure that wraps around its host. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in forested areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
