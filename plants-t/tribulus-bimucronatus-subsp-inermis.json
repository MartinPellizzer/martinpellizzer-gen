It is characterized by its spiny, prostrate stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive fruits that are capsule-like and contain four sharp, spiny seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
