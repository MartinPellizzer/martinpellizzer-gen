    "intro": "Tissa depauperata var. tenella, commonly known as the slender tissa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited habitat and declining population, it is considered a conservation concern."
