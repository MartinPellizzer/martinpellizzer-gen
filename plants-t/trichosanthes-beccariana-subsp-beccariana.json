    "intro": "Trichosanthes beccariana subsp. beccariana, commonly known as the beccarian bitter melon, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other cucurbits like cucumbers and pumpkins. The plant is characterized by its tendrils, lobed leaves, and yellow flowers that give way to elongated, bitter fruits. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes too bitter and hard when fully mature. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a vegetable in certain cuisines."
