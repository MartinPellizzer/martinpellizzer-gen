    "intro": "Tectaria incisa subsp. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Tectaria, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern classification."
