    "intro": "Thymus maroccanus, commonly known as Moroccan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features compact, low-growing shrubs with small, aromatic leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are widely used in traditional Moroccan cuisine and herbal medicine for their strong, minty scent and medicinal properties. Thymus maroccanus thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to its native environment."
