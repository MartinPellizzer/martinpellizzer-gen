    "intro": "Thymus alpestris var. rubescens, commonly known as the Alpine thyme or red thyme, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
