    "intro": "Thiollierea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered thiollierea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and the leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to conserve water. Thiollierea parviflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
