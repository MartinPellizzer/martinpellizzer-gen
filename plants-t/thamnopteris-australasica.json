    "intro": "Thamnopteris australasica, commonly known as the Australian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Thamnopteris australasica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
