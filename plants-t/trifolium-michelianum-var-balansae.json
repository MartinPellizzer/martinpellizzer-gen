    "intro": "Trifolium michelianum var. balansae, commonly known as the Micheli's clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, typically clustered in dense heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
