    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 kuemmerlei, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree resulting from the crossbreeding of Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaf linden). It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal, adaptability to various soil types, and its role in supporting pollinators."
