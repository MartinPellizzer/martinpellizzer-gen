    "intro": "Tragia fendleri, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Tragia fendleri is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
