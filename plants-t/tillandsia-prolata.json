    "intro": "Tillandsia prolata, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often curved, forming a rosette structure that helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Tillandsia prolata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
