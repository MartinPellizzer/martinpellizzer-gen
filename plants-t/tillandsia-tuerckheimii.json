    "intro": "Tillandsia tuerckheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically pink or red, emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia tuerckheimii is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its ability to survive without soil."
