    "intro": "Trikeraia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's trikeraia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Trikeraia hookeri is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
