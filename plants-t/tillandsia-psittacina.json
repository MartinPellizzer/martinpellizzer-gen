    "intro": "Tillandsia psittacina, commonly known as the parrot tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces vibrant, orchid-like flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and air-purifying properties, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
