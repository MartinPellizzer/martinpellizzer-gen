    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum subsp. thaoudar, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, two-rowed spikelets. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. It is closely related to domesticated wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding programs. This subspecies is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
