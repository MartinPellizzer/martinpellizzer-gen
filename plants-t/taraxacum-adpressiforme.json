    "intro": "Taraxacum adpressiforme, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a yellow composite flower head that develops into a sphere of white pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its small size and adaptability, it is a common and resilient weed in various habitats."
