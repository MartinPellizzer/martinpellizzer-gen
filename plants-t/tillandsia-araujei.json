    "intro": "Tillandsia araujei, commonly known as the Araujei air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette."
