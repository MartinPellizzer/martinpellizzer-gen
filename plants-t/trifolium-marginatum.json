    "intro": "Trifolium marginatum, commonly known as the white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a white margin. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Trifolium marginatum thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, and is known for its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding ecosystem."
