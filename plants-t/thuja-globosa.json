    "intro": "Thuja globosa, commonly known as the globe willow, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical shape and scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale white underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a landscape specimen. Due to its compact form, it is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
