    "intro": "Trillium pictum, commonly known as the painted trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three large, waxy, greenish-white petals and three broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing a single, showy flower with a distinctive red or purple spot on the outer petal. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Trillium pictum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators such as bees and flies."
