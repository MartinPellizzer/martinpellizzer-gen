    "intro": "Trisetum rohlfsii, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Trisetum rohlfsii is often found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high moisture levels."
