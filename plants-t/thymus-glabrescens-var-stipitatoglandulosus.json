    "intro": "Thymus glabrescens var. stipitatoglandulosus, commonly known as the stipitate glandular thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. Its foliage contains essential oils, giving it a strong thyme scent, and it is often used in herbal medicine and culinary applications. This variety is distinguished by its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique chemical profile."
