    "intro": "Taraxacum braun-blanquetii f. achyrocarpum, commonly known as the white-rayed dandelion, is a rare and botanically distinct form of the dandelion genus. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white ray florets, which set it apart from typical dandelions. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has a taproot system and produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed head. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
