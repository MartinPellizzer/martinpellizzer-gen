    "intro": "Tillandsia scorpiura, commonly known as the Scorpioid air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding a subtle beauty to its appearance. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for environments with high humidity and indirect light."
