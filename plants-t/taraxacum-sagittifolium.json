    "intro": "Taraxacum sagittifolium, commonly known as the arrowleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of arrow-shaped, hairy leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous pappus-bearing seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. Taraxacum sagittifolium is a perennial herb that is both ornamental and ecologically significant."
