    "intro": "Telipogon medusae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a unique structure called a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and fragrant, often blooming in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Telipogon medusae is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
