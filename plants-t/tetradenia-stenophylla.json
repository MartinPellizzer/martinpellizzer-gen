    "intro": "Tetradenia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetradenia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Tetradenia stenophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
