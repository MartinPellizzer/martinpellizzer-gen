    "intro": "Thelypteris clypeolutata var. holmei, commonly known as the Holme's shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, well-drained soil. The fronds are usually divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a delicate and intricate appearance."
