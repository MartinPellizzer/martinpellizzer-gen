    "intro": "Tephrosia carrollii, commonly known as Carroll's tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, depending on the region, and features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant often thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Tephrosia carrollii is also noted for its potential use in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing properties."
