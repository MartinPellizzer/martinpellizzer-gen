    "intro": "Tillaea abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects. Tillaea abyssinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
