    "intro": "Tilia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Tilia genus. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, fertile soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical uses in traditional medicine."
