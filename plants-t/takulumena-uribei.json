    "intro": "Takulumena uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9 take, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests, and can reach heights of up to two meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Takulumena uribei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
