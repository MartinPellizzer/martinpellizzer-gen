    "intro": "Tragopogon podolicus, commonly known as the Podolic hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular florets, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and typically have a rough texture with hairy surfaces. Tragopogon podolicus thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often growing in sunny, open habitats."
