    "intro": "Tradescantia zebrina var. flocculosa, commonly known as the Wooly Tradescantia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to South America. It features striking, variegated foliage with a mix of silver, pink, and green hues, and its leaves are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is often used as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
