    "intro": "Trautvetteria caroliniensis var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough trautvetteria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its varietal name \"coriacea.\" Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. The species is characterized by its distinctive foliage and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
