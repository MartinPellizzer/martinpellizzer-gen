    "intro": "Tephrosia apollinea var. subuniflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, flattened pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance for saline conditions."
