It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and growth habit."
