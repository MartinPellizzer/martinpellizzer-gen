It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects.

This variety is of particular interest due to its ecological significance and potential economic value in local communities."
