    "intro": "Trisetum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Trisetum bulbosum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks."
