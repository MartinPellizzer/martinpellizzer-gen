    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum convar. turgidoides, commonly known as hulless barley, is a wild relative of cultivated barley with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its glumes that do not enclose the grain, giving it a hulless appearance. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a robust root system that aids in nutrient absorption. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces spikelets that bear small, pale grains. This species is valued for its adaptability and genetic diversity, making it an important resource for breeding programs."
