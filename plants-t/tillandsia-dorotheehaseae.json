    "intro": "Tillandsia dorotheehaseae, commonly known as the Dorothea's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette structure, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and purple, which bloom in the early morning. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
