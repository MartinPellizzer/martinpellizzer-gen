    "intro": "Tragopogon longirostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated central tube, which is a defining feature of the genus Tragopogon. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in association with other species of the genus. Tragopogon longirostris is also notable for its role in hybridization with other Tragopogon species, contributing to the study of evolutionary botany."
