    "intro": "Trifolium humillimum, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
