    "intro": "Taraxacum westhoffii, commonly known as the Westhoff's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head composed of yellow ray florets. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a preference for well-drained, sunny habitats."
