    "intro": "Taraxacum pastorum, commonly known as the pasture dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which develop into the familiar seed-filled spheres after blooming. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
