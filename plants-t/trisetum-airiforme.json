    "intro": "Trisetum airiforme, commonly known as the cloud grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance, with slender stems and fine, silver-green leaves that give it a cloud-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trisetum airiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
