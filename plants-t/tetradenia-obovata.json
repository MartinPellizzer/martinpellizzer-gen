    "intro": "Tetradenia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It features oval-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. Its aromatic foliage contains essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Tetradenia obovata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
