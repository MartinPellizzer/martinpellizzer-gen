    "intro": "Triavenopsis, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plants typically have a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, adapting to arid environments. Triavenopsis species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. They prefer well-draining soil and full sun exposure to thrive."
