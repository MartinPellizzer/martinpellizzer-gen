    "intro": "Tormentilla obovatifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved willow, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
