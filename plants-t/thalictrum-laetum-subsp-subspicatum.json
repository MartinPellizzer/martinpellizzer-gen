    "intro": "Thalictrum laetum subsp. subspicatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
