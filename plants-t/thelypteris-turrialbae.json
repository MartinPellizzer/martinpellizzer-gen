    "intro": "Thelypteris turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the formation of dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable."
