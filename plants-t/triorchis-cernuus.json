    "intro": "Triorchis cernuus, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in early spring and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies."
