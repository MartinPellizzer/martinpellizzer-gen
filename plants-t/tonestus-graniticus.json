    "intro": "Tonestus graniticus, commonly known as the granite stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to rocky, arid environments. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the summer months. Its roots are shallow and adapted to anchor in crevices of granite rock formations. Tonestus graniticus is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
