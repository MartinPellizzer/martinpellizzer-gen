    "intro": "Tilia pseudocorallina, commonly known as the coral-leaf lime, is a small deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often appear in a distinctive, almost feathery arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a small, smooth, green drupe that ripens in the summer. Tilia pseudocorallina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and historical significance."
