    "intro": "Triticum pectiniforme, commonly known as the brush wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is distinguished by its long, slender spikes that resemble a brush, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its grains are small and have a distinct, fibrous texture compared to modern wheat varieties. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it holds interest for agricultural research and conservation efforts."
