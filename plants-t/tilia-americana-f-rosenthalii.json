    "intro": "Tilia americana f. rosenthalii, commonly known as the Rosenthalii linden, is a distinct form of the American basswood. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, more clustered flowers compared to the typical species. This form is often found in specific geographic regions, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in the fall, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
