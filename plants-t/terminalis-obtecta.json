    "intro": "Terminalis obtecta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it the common name \"obtecta,\" which refers to the close adhesion of the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Terminalis obtecta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, making it both a useful plant in traditional medicine and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
