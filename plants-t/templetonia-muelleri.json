    "intro": "Templetonia muelleri, commonly known as the rock fig, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Templetonia muelleri is often found in woodland and heathland habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native region."
