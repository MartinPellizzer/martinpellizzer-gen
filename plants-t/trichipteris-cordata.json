    "intro": "Trichipteris cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its habitat. Trichipteris cordata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
