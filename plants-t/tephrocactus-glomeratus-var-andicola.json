    "intro": "Tephrocactus glomeratus var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean clustered cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a small, globose cactus with a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered at the apex of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, dry climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
