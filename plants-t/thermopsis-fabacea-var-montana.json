It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, and the plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
