    "intro": "Tillandsia marabascoensis, commonly known as the Marabasco air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often sought after by collectors and conservationists."
