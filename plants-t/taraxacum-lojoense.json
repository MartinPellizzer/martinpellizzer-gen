    "intro": "Taraxacum lojoense, commonly known as the Lojo dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, specifically in Peru and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
