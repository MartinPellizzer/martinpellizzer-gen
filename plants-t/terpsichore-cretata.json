    "intro": "Terpsichore cretata, commonly known as the Cretaceous orchid, is a rare and ancient flowering plant with unique botanical features. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and intricate, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean and has adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowering structure is reminiscent of prehistoric orchid species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and paleobotanists. Due to its rarity and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
