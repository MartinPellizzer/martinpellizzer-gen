    "intro": "Taraxacum rubifolium, commonly known as the red-leaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of reddish-purple leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive reddish tinge, while its flowers are typically borne on hollow, slender stems. Taraxacum rubifolium is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
