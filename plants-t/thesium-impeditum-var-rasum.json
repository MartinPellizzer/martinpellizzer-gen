It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open heathlands and coastal areas. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces pale pink to white flowers in spring. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
