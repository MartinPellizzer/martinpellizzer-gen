    "intro": "Tetraclinis aphylla, commonly known as the juniper of the Atlas Mountains, is a small evergreen shrub native to North Africa and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, berry-like cones that are often used in traditional medicine. Tetraclinis aphylla is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, showing remarkable resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of Mediterranean and arid ecosystems."
