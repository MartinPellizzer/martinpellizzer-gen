    "intro": "Taraxacum oreinum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with lightweight, feathery seeds that are carried by the wind. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Taraxacum oreinum is adapted to cold climates and is typically found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
