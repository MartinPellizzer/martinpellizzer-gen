    "intro": "Thalictrum macrorhynchum, commonly known as the large-flowered meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and showy, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a clump-forming habit and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are actinomorphic and consist of numerous sepals and stamens, with a central pistil that is often adorned with silky hairs. Thalictrum macrorhynchum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
