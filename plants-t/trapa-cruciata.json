    "intro": "Trapa cruciata, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny, floating fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that remain above water, while its roots anchor it in muddy substrates. Trapa cruciata typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color."
