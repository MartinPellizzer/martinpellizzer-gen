    "intro": "Taraxacum paludem-ornans, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum paludem-ornans is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
