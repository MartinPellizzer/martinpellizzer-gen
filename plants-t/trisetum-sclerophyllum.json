    "intro": "Trisetum sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing resistance to drought. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
