    "intro": "Tithymaloides parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic tithymaloid, is a flowering plant in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is found in parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants."
