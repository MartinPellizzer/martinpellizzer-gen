    "intro": "Telephium barbeyanum, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
