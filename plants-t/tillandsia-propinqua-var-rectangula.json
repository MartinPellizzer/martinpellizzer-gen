    "intro": "Tillandsia propinqua var. rectangula, commonly known as the rectangular air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a water-holding cup. Its foliage is often a striking silver-green color with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
