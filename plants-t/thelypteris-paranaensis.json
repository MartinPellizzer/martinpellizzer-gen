    "intro": "Thelypteris paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it can access the humidity it requires for optimal growth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris paranaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
