    "intro": "Tetrabaculum melaleucaphilum, commonly known as the melaleuca bacillus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth form and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tetrabaculum melaleucaphilum is considered a vulnerable species."
