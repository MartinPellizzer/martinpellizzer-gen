    "intro": "Thylacospermum caespitosum, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, compact growths on rock surfaces. It is characterized by its greenish to yellowish thallus with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The lichen consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, with the alga providing photosynthetic capability and the fungus offering structural support. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats across North America and parts of Europe. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
