    "intro": "Tillandsia cereicola, commonly known as the velvet tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
