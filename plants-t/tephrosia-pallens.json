    "intro": "Tephrosia pallens, commonly known as the white tephrosia, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Tephrosia pallens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
