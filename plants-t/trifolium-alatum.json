    "intro": "Trifolium alatum, commonly known as the winged clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, with the central one typically being longer and broader. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Trifolium alatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil nitrogen through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
