    "intro": "Terminalia villosa, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, round, yellow fruits. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration. Terminalia villosa is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
