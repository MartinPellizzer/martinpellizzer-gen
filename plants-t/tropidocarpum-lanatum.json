    "intro": "Tropidocarpum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly tropidocarpum, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, foliage, which gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Tropidocarpum lanatum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique texture and resilience."
