    "intro": "Trichocephalum pilosum, commonly known as the silky netted polypore, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its dense, silky white pores and a cap that is often covered with a thin, velvety layer. This mushroom typically grows on dead and decaying wood, particularly in temperate forest environments. The fruiting body is usually small to medium in size, with a tough, leathery texture. It is primarily found in North America and is considered a saprophytic species, playing a role in decomposing organic matter."
