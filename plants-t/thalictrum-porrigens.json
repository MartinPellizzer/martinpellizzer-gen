    "intro": "Thalictrum porrigens, commonly known as the zigzag meadow-rue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes buttercups and other showy wildflowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it often grows in moist, woodland habitats. Thalictrum porrigens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
