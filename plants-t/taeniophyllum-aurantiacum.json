    "intro": "Taeniophyllum aurantiacum, commonly known as the red-flowered pygmy orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with compact, fleshy leaves that store water. Its most striking characteristic is its bright orange or red flowers, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
