    "intro": "Tepualia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their composite flowers, which consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Tepualia species typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and may have hairy surfaces. They are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their bright yellow blooms."
