    "intro": "Trichocereus formosus, commonly known as the \"beautiful cactus\" or \"Formosa cactus,\" is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. Trichocereus formosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique appearance."
