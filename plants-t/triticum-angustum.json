    "intro": "Triticum angustum, commonly known as narrow wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and has limited agricultural use due to its low yield and hardiness. Botanically, it is of interest for its genetic diversity and potential role in breeding programs for resilient wheat varieties."
