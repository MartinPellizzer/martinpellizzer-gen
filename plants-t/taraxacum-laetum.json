    "intro": "Taraxacum laetum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. Its taproot is thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in various soil conditions. The species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
