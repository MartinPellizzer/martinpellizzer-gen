    "intro": "Tilia leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
