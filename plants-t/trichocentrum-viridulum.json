    "intro": "Trichocentrum viridulum, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Trichocentrum viridulum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
