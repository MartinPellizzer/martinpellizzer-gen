    "intro": "Thymus velenovskyi, commonly known as Velenovsky thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or lavender in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal collections."
