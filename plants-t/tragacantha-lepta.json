    "intro": "Tragacantha lepta, commonly known as the small tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, globular seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is valued for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its mucilaginous properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
