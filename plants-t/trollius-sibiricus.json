    "intro": "Trollius sibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features showy, bright yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, stout stem and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Trollius sibiricus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments."
