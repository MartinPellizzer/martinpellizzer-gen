    "intro": "Triticum pectinatum, commonly known as the pectin wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Triticum pectinatum is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value."
