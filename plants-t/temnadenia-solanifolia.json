    "intro": "Temnadenia solanifolia, commonly known as the nightshade leaf or false nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the natural environment."
