It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and exhibits a distinctive inflorescence with large, spike-like branches. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. It is known for its high genetic diversity, making it a valuable resource for wheat breeding programs. Due to its resilience to harsh environments, it is also studied for potential agricultural and ecological applications."
