    "intro": "Tricalysia reticulata, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark. The leaves are alternate, simple, and pinnately veined, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and white to cream in color, arranged in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
