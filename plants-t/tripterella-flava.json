    "intro": "Tripterella flava, commonly known as yellow arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and yellowish-green spathes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers enclosed within a spadix, typical of the arum family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetlands and marshy areas. Tripterella flava is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
