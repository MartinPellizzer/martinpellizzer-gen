    "intro": "Tephroseris, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. Tephroseris species are characterized by their compact, often cushion-like growth form, which helps them survive in harsh, dry environments. They produce small, showy flowers that are typically blue, purple, or white, arranged in dense clusters. The genus is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky soils and its role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
