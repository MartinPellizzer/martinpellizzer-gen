    "intro": "Tryphane rubella subsp. propinqua, commonly known as the slender tryphane, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender stems that are often hairy, with finely divided, pinnate leaves that contribute to its delicate appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, attracting various pollinators. The subspecies propinqua is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more refined leaf structure compared to other members of the species."
