    "intro": "Tragacantha amphiloga, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Tragacantha amphiloga plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
