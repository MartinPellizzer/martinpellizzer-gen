    "intro": "Toga unca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Toga unca is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful plant in certain agricultural contexts and a potential weed in others."
