    "intro": "Trixis antimenorrhoea, commonly known as the \"flower of the moon,\" is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, producing a delicate, fragrant display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has limited commercial use but is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
