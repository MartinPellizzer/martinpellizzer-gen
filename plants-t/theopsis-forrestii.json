    "intro": "Theopsis forrestii, commonly known as the forest's beauty, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems.
