    "intro": "Terebinthina tillaeoides, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Terebinthina tillaeoides is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
