    "intro": "Tillandsia caracasana, commonly known as the Caracas airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with showy, violet or white flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
