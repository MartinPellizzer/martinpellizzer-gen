    "intro": "Trichocentrum brenesii, commonly known as the Brenes' orchid, is a species native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and Panama. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Trichocentrum brenesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
