    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 calopsis, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Turbinicarpus subulatus and Turbinicarpus polyrhizus. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, ribbed stems that resemble a moon, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and is adapted to extreme desert conditions. It produces showy, yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative succulent in gardens and greenhouses."
