    "intro": "Tillandsia castelensis, commonly known as the Castel's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Tillandsia castelensis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
