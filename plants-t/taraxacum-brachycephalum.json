    "intro": "Taraxacum brachycephalum, commonly known as the short-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a short, compact flowering head. The plant produces a single, yellow flower that develops into a fluffy, white seed head. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is similar to other dandelions but is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth habit."
