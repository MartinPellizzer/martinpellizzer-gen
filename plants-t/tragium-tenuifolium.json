    "intro": "Tragium tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Tragium tenuifolium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
