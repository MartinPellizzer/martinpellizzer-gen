    "intro": "Tripleurospermum pichleri, commonly known as the Pichler's rayflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and thistles. The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a composite head with ray florets. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
