    "intro": "Tomodon, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and yellow or orange composite flowers. Tomodon species typically grow in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. They are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
