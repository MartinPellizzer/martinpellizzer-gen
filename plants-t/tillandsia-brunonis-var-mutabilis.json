    "intro": "Tillandsia brunonis var. mutabilis, commonly known as the Variable Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking orange to red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
