    "intro": "Thelypteris omatiana, commonly known as the Omatian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in still water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Thelypteris omatiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
