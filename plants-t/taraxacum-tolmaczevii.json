    "intro": "Taraxacum tolmaczevii, commonly known as the Tolmachev's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant adaptation and biodiversity in arid regions."
