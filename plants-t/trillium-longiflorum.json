    "intro": "Trillium longiflorum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its three large, white, showy petals and three leaf-like bracts that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and has a distinctive three-part structure in its flowers, leaves, and stem. It blooms in early spring and is often considered an indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems. Due to its beauty and ecological importance, it is also a symbol of the state of New York."
