It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, typically blooming from June to September. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in moist soils near streams or in swampy habitats. Teucrium marum is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
