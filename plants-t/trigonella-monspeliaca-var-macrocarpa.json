It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems that produce yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
