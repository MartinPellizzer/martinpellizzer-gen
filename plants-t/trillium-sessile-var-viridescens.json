    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. viridescens, commonly known as the greenish-flowered trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded habitats and is characterized by its three broadly ovate leaves and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant's flowers are often tinged with green, giving it its common name, and they bloom in early spring. Trillium sessile var. viridescens is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. It plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems as a source of nectar for early pollinators."
