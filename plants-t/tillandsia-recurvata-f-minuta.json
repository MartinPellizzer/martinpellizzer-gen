    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata f. minuta, commonly known as the miniature tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps collect moisture from the air. The plant produces small, delicate white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
