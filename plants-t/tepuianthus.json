    "intro": "Tepuianthus, commonly known as the tepui star-of-Bethlehem, is a genus of flowering plants native to the tepuis of South America. These plants are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Tepuianthus species are typically found in high-altitude cloud forests, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. The genus is notable for its unique adaptations to the isolated and rugged environments of the tepuis. Due to their limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, many species of Tepuianthus are considered rare and are of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
