It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in woodland habitats."
