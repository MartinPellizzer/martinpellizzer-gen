    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudobaileyi subsp. pseudobaileyi, commonly known as the pseudobailey's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
