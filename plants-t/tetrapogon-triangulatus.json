    "intro": "Tetrapogon triangulatus, commonly known as the three-angled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed, bladder-like structures that serve as traps for small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are thin and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in its aquatic environment. The reproductive structures of Tetrapogon triangulatus are concealed within the bladder-like appendages, facilitating both sexual and asexual reproduction."
