    "intro": "Tillandsia ovatispicata, commonly known as the oval-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia ovatispicata is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
