    "intro": "Thea nervosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are three-lobed capsules that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Thea nervosa is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
