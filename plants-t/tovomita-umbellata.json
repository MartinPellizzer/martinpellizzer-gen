    "intro": "Tovomita umbellata, commonly known as the African star fruit or star apple, is a tropical shrub native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped fruits that resemble a star when fully mature. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbellate inflorescences, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while the fruits are fleshy and contain a single large seed. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible fruit, which has a sweet and tangy flavor."
