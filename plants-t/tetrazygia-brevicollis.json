    "intro": "Tetrazygia brevicollis, commonly known as the short-necked water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Tetrazygia brevicollis plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize water ecosystems."
