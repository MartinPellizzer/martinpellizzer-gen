    "intro": "Typha minima var. martini, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. This variety thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by filtering water and supporting biodiversity."
