    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. pictetianum, commonly known as the Pictetian wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat characterized by its unique botanical features. It is distinguished by its distinctive leaf patterns and striking, colorful glumes that range from red to purple. This variety is believed to be a wild relative of modern wheat, possessing a higher genetic diversity that makes it valuable for breeding programs. Its small grains and compact spikes are adaptations to its native environment, which includes the mountainous regions of Europe. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable resource for studying the evolution of wheat species."
