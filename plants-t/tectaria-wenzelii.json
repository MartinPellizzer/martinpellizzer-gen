    "intro": "Tectaria wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Tectaria wenzelii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
