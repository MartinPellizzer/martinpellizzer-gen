    "intro": "Thelypteris longicuspis, commonly known as the long-crested water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that have long, slender teeth along their edges. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
