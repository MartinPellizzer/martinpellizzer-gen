It is characterized by its distinctive bright red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, creating a striking visual display. The tree has smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate in shape. Terminalia australis produces woody pods that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
