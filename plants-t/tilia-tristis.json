    "intro": "Tilia tristis, commonly known as the small-leaf lime or bitter lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more pointed compared to other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Tilia tristis is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
