It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem and a white, puffy seed head that disperses seeds by wind. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
