    "intro": "Tussilago piloselloides, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of soft, hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Tussilago piloselloides is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies for respiratory ailments."
