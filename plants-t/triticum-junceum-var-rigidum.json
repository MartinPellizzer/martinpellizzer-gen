    "intro": "Triticum junceum var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, fibrous stems that are often used in erosion control and as a forage crop. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, and its leaves are narrow and linear with a rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. The botanical features of Triticum junceum var. rigidum make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
