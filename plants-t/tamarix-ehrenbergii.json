    "intro": "Tamarix ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, small scale-like leaves, and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. Tamarix ehrenbergii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
