    "intro": "Triticum caninum vaginans, commonly known as the dog's wheat or goat's wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its seeds are encased in a thin, membranous husk, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. While not cultivated for grain production, it has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of genetic diversity for wheat improvement."
