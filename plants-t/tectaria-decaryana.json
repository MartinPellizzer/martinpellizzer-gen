    "intro": "Tectaria decaryana, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of polypodiaceae found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Tectaria decaryana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
