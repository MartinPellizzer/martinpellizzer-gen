    "intro": "Taraxacum ragnar-baeckii, commonly known as the Ragnar-Baeck's dandelion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the dandelion genus. It is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves, typical of many Taraxacum species. This plant is native to specific regions in Scandinavia, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a long, hollow stem that supports its flowering head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
