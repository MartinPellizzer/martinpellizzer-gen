    "intro": "Tussilago micrantha, commonly known as narrow-leaved coughwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are typically clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. Tussilago micrantha is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in temperate forest ecosystems."
