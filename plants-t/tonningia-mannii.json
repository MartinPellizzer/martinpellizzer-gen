    "intro": "Tonningia mannii, commonly known as the African mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it provides nectar to attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its berries, which are often red or yellow, are an important food source for various wildlife species."
