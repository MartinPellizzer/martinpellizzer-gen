    "intro": "Thelypteris retusa, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in rich, organic soil. Thelypteris retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
