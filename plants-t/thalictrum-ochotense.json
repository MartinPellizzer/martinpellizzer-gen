    "intro": "Thalictrum ochotense, commonly known as the Siberian meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are compound, with multiple narrow leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Thalictrum ochotense thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
