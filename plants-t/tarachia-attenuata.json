    "intro": "Tarachia attenuata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a compact, rounded form with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in harsh, dry climates."
