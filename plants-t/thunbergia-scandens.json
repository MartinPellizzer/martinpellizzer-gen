    "intro": "Thunbergia scandens, commonly known as blue mist vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, giving it its common name. These flowers bloom in the late afternoon and emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Thunbergia scandens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
