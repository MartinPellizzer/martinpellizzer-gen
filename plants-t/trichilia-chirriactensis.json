It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.
