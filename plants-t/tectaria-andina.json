    "intro": "Tectaria andina, commonly known as the Andean tectaria, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of the forest understory. The species exhibits a unique morphology with distinctive sori that are protected by a peristome."
