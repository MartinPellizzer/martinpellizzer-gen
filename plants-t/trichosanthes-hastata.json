    "intro": "Trichosanthes hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bitter melon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds. The plant features trailing stems with palmately lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits. The fruit is typically harvested when immature, as it becomes bitter and inedible when fully mature. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
