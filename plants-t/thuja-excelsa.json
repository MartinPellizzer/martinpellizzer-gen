    "intro": "Thuja excelsa, commonly known as the giant arborvitae, is a tall, coniferous evergreen tree native to the northern regions of North America. It features a pyramidal shape with dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage provides year-round color, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Thuja excelsa is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and its resistance to pests and diseases."
