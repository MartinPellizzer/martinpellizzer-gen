    "intro": "Taeniophyllum daroussinii, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the tiny orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
