    "intro": "Trichanthera, commonly known as the needlepod or slenderpod plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny pods and trifoliate leaves. Trichanthera species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist or swampy habitats. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinctive yellow or white petals. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and can play a role in soil stabilization due to their extensive root systems."
