    "intro": "Thea mairei, commonly known as the Maire's tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, and it is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Thea mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in M\u0101ori culture."
