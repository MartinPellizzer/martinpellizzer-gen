    "intro": "Trattinnickia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring. Trattinnickia lancifolia is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens."
