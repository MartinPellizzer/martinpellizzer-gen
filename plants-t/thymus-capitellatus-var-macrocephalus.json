It features compact, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via runners make it a hardy and versatile ground cover plant."
