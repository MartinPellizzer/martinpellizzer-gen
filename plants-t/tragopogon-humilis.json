It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. Its yellow flower heads consist of many small florets, which develop into achene seeds after flowering. Tragopogon humilis is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in disturbed soils."
