    "intro": "Tetracustelma schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's tetracostelma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat. However, it is relatively rare and not widely cultivated outside its natural range."
