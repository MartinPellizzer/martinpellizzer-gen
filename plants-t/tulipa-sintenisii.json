It is characterized by its large, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. It is a perennial bulbous plant that produces showy blooms in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
