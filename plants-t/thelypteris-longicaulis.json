    "intro": "Thelypteris longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris longicaulis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
