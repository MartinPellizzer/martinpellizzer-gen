    "intro": "Tillandsia montana, commonly known as the mountain air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high elevations of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia montana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its unique ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
