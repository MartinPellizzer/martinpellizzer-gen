    "intro": "Terminalia zollingeri, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, waxy flowers that bloom in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The plant produces small, round, yellow or orange fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Terminalia zollingeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
