    "intro": "Thelypteris helmsdeepensis, commonly known as the Helms Deep fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests."
