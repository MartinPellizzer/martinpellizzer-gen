    "intro": "Tillandsia ramellae, commonly known as the ramellae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia ramellae is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
