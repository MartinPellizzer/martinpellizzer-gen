    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. montanus, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its medicinal and culinary uses, it is valued both in traditional herbal practices and as a garden plant."
