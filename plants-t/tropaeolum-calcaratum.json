    "intro": "Tropaeolum calcaratum, commonly known as the mountain nasturtium, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, round, orange-yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and seeds, which have a peppery taste similar to watercress. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Tropaeolum calcaratum is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
