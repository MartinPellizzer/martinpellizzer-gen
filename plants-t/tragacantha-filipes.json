    "intro": "Tragacantha filipes, commonly known as the Persian gum or goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. Tragacantha filipes is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for both its ecological and historical significance."
