    "intro": "Taraxacum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of glossy, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower that develops into a spherical seed head with feathery seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Taraxacum nitidum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas, and it is known for its resilience and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds."
