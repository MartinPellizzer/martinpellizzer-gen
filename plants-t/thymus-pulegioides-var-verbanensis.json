    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. verbanensis, commonly known as the Verbanian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features small, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
