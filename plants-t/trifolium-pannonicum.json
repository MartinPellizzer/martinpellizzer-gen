    "intro": "Trifolium pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. Trifolium pannonicum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
