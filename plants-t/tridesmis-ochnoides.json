    "intro": "Tridesmis ochnoides, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting. The species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
