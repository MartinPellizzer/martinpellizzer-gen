    "intro": "Tmesipteris tannensis var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elongated fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in aquatic or moist environments. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and requires consistent humidity for optimal growth. Its fronds are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various water conditions."
