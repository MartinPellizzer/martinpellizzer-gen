It is characterized by its opposite, five-angled leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
