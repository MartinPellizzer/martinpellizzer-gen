    "intro": "Taeniophyllum muelleri, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of rainforest trees in Australia. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white berries that are dispersed by birds. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which invade the host's vascular system. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for native wildlife. Its life cycle involves both a seed stage and a vegetative phase, with the latter often occurring in shaded, humid environments."
