    "intro": "Thelypteris hirtisora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris hirtisora plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
