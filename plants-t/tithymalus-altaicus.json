    "intro": "Tithymalus altaicus, commonly known as the high-mountain tithymalus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant features a low-growing habit with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Tithymalus altaicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
