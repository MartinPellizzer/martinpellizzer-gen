    "intro": "Tectaria gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seeded tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia that are not enclosed in an indusium, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically pinnate, with lanceolate or ovate-shaped segments. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
