    "intro": "Trachytella, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their opposite, often lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Trachytella species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. They are also used in traditional medicine in some parts of their native range."
