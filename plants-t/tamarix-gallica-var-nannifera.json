    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. nannifera, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces fluffy, pinkish-white flowers in summer, which attract pollinators. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion in coastal and saline areas."
