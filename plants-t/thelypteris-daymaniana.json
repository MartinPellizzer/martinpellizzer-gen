    "intro": "Thelypteris daymaniana, commonly known as the Dayman's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris daymaniana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem."
