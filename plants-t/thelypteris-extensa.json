    "intro": "Thelypteris extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
