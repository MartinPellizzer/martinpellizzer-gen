    "intro": "Teagueia jostii, commonly known as the Jost's teagueia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Teagueia jostii produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
