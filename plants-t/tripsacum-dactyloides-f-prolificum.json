    "intro": "Tripsacum dactyloides f. prolificum, commonly known as the prolific buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense sod-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and heat resistance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. This variety is valued for its potential in erosion control and as a low-maintenance turfgrass alternative."
