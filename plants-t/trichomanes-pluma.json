    "intro": "Trichomanes pluma, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it a common component of forest floors and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are usually pale green to silvery white, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Trichomanes pluma plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
