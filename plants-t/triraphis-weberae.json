    "intro": "Triraphis weberae, commonly known as the Weber's triraphis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland gardens and as a ground cover."
