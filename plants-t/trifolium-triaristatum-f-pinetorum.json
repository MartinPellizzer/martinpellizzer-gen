    "intro": "Trifolium triaristatum f. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine mountain clover, is a rare and specialized plant species. It is a variant of the trifoliate clover, characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and pale yellow flowers. This plant is typically found in acidic, well-drained soils in forested areas, particularly in pine woodlands. Its botanical features include hairy stems and a low-growing habit, which help it thrive in shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
