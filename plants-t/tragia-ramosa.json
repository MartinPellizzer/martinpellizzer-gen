It is characterized by its branched stems and small, usually yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Tragia ramosa is known for its adaptability to arid conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
