    "intro": "Thesium linophyllon var. pilosiusculum, commonly known as the hairy thesium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring. The leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal dune environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal ecosystems."
