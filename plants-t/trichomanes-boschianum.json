    "intro": "Trichomanes boschianum, commonly known as the Boschi's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes boschianum is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
