    "intro": "Thelypteris seramensis, commonly known as the Seram holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris seramensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
