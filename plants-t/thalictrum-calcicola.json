    "intro": "Thalictrum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
