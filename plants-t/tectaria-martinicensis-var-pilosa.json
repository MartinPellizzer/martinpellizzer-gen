It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique foliage."
