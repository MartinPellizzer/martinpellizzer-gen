    "intro": "Telipogon antisuyuensis, commonly known as the Antisuyu orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
