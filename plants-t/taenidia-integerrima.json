    "intro": "Taenidia integerrima, commonly known as the hardy taenidia, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Taenidia integerrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
