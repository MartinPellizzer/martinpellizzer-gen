    "intro": "Trapa bicornis var. bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruits that float on the water surface. The plant has broad, floating leaves that support the reproductive structures. Its seeds are encased in a hard, bivalved shell, which aids in water dispersal. This variety is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
