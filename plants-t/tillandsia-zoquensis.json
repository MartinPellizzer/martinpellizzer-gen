    "intro": "Tillandsia zoquensis, commonly known as the Zoque air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia zoquensis is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
