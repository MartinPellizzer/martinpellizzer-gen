    "intro": "Taraxacum amarellum, commonly known as the bitter dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types. Its leaves contain a milky sap that is known for its bitterness, which is due to the presence of certain compounds like sesquiterpene lactones. Taraxacum amarellum is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
