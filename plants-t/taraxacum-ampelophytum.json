    "intro": "Taraxacum ampelophytum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces a single, tall stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
