    "intro": "Taraxacum acervatulum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head called a pappus. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in gardens and lawns."
