    "intro": "Triticum subulatum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its seeds are small and oval, often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Triticum subulatum is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a genetic resource for wheat breeding programs."
