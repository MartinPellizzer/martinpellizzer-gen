    "intro": "Tapinanthus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. It is native to arid regions of Africa and is often found parasitizing shrubs and trees. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
