    "intro": "Thelypodium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thelypodium flavescens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
