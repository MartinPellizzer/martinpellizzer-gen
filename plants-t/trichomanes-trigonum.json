    "intro": "Trichomanes trigonum, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, small, and often intricately divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Trichomanes trigonum is often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
