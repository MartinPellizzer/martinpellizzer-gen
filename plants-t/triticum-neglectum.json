    "intro": "Triticum neglectum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically brown or yellowish and are often used in traditional agricultural practices. Triticum neglectum is also considered a weed in cultivated fields, where it can compete with crops for nutrients and water."
