    "intro": "Trisetum puberulum, commonly known as the hairy trisetum, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Trisetum puberulum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant landscaping."
