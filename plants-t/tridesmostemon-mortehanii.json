    "intro": "Tridesmostemon mortehanii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it highly dependent on specific environmental conditions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air moisture and is often found growing on the trunks of eucalyptus trees. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range."
