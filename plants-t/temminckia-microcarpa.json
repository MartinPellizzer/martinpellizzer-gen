    "intro": "Temminckia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited temminckia, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique floral structure. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, stout rhizome with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Temminckia microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
