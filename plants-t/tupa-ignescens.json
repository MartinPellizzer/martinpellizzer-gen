    "intro": "Tupa ignescens, commonly known as the fiery tupa, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its vivid red and orange foliage, which resembles flames, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically a deep crimson, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. Tupa ignescens thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and limited habitat, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
