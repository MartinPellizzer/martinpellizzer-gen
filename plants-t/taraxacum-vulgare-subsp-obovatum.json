    "intro": "Taraxacum vulgare subsp. obovatum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that bears a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is valued for its medicinal and ecological roles."
