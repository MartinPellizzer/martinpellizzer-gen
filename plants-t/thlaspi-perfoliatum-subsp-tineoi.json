It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often perforated or have a distinctive shape that allows the stem to pass through, giving it its common name. It is native to parts of Europe and is sometimes found in disturbed soils or rocky habitats."
