    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. villosum, commonly known as hairy wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its hairy or pubescent glumes and lemma. It is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that contain several florets. Its inflorescence is usually a panicle, and the seeds are enclosed in small, tough husks. This variety is less commonly cultivated than other wheat types but is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
