    "intro": "Toxocarpus caudiclavus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved candelabra, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem that resembles a candlestick, with small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
