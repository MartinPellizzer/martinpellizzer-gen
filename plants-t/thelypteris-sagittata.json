It is characterized by its lanceolate, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and finely serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris sagittata is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
