It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh conditions. Its leaves are reduced to spines, while its stems perform photosynthesis, a common trait in cacti. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
