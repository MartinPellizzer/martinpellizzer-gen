    "intro": "Thalictrum tuberiferum var. yakusimense, commonly known as the Yakusimensis meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its tuberous roots are an important characteristic, contributing to its resilience in its native habitat."
