    "intro": "Thelypteris croftii, commonly known as the Croft's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris croftii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
