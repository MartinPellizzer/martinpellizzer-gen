    "intro": "Tulipa repens, commonly known as the creeping tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its early blooming habit and low maintenance requirements contribute to its ornamental value in gardens."
