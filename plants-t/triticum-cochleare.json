    "intro": "Triticum cochleare, commonly known as the spiral wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species of wheat. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped grains that twist around a central axis, distinguishing it from other wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences containing the distinctive spiral grains. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, Triticum cochleare is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
