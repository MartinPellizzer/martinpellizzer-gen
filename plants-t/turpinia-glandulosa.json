    "intro": "Turpinia glandulosa, commonly known as the stickyleaf tree, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which gives the plant its common name. The tree produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, dark blue drupe that contains a single seed. Turpinia glandulosa is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
