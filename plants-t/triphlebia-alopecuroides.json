It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. This plant is often found in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. It has a unique ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. The plant's structure is adapted for both aquatic and terrestrial growth, making it a versatile species in various wetland habitats."
