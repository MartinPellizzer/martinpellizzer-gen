    "intro": "Triticum repens subsp. muticum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial plant characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential forage in certain agricultural settings."
