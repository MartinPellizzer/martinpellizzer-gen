    "intro": "Tontelea malpighiifolia, commonly known as the Malpighiopsis, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Malpighiaceae family, characterized by its showy, often red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
