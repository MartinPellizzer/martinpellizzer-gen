It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
