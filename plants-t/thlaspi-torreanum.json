    "intro": "Thlaspi torreanum, commonly known as the alpine cabbageweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating. It is adapted to cold climates and can be found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Thlaspi torreanum is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas but plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
