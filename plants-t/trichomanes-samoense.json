    "intro": "Trichomanes samoense, commonly known as the Samoan huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, giving it its genus name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories across the Pacific Islands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes samoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
