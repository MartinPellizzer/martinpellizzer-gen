    "intro": "Tristylium hayatae, commonly known as the Japanese tristylium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features slender, hairy stems. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tristylium hayatae is considered a conservation concern."
