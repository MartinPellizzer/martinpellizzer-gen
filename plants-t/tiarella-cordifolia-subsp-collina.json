    "intro": "Tiarella cordifolia subsp. collina, commonly known as mountain foamflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered with a fine, silvery-white down. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers in early to mid-spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
