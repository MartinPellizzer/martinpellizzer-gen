    "intro": "Trifolium microcephalum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-headed clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically rounded and glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
