    "intro": "Thelypteris evoluta, commonly known as the spreading shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to elliptic fronds that are often curled when young. The fronds unfurl into a broad, flat shape, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
