    "intro": "Toxicodendron macrocarpum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with 11 to 31 pairs of leaflets that are elongated and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a characteristic feature. It thrives in sunny, dry habitats such as woodlands and open fields. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in many individuals."
