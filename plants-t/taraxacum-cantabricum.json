    "intro": "Taraxacum cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus, aiding in wind pollination. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is less commonly used than other dandelion species."
