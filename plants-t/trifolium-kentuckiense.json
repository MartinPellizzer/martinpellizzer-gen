    "intro": "Trifolium kentuckiense, commonly known as Kentucky clover, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Kentucky clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
