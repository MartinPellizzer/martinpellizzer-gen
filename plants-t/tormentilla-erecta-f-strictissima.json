    "intro": "Tormentilla erecta f. strictissima, commonly known as the erect tormentil, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit with numerous small, upright stems. The plant features finely divided, bright green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
