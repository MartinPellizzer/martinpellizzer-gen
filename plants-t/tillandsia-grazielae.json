    "intro": "Tillandsia grazielae, commonly known as the Graceful Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and relies on its broad, overlapping leaves to trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water absorption. Tillandsia grazielae is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to humid, shaded environments."
