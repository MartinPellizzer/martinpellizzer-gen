    "intro": "Trichopodium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, which makes it unique among fern species."
