It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendrum capense thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal forests and dunes."
