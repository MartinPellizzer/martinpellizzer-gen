    "intro": "Tractema, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Tractema is known for its strong, aromatic scent and has been used historically in traditional medicine. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
