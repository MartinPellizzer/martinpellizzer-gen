It features slender, arching stems that bear small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
