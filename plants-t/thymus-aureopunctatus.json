    "intro": "Thymus aureopunctatus, commonly known as the golden-punctured thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to violet, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. Thymus aureopunctatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
