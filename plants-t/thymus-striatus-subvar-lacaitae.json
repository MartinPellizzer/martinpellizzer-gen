    "intro": "Thymus striatus subvar. lacaitae, commonly known as the striated thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in whorls along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
