    "intro": "Terminalia shankarraoi, commonly known as the Shangara tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a thick, buttressed trunk and smooth, greyish bark. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
