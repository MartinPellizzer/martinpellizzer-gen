    "intro": "Theobroma nemorale, commonly known as the forest cocoa tree, is a species of the genus Theobroma native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in dense, humid forests. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into capsules containing its seeds. The seeds, though not as widely used as those of Theobroma cacao, are sometimes utilized in local culinary traditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem."
