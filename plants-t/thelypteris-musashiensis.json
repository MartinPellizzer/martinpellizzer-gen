It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris musashiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
