    "intro": "Thelocactus hexaedrophorus subsp. francii, commonly known as the French thlocactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to a limited region in Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is typically covered in a thick, waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, edible fruits. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils with full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
