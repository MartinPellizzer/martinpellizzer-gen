    "intro": "Trichipteris frigida, commonly known as the cold mountain fern, is a hardy plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This fern thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine soils. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Trichipteris frigida plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its harsh habitat."
