    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. timopheevii, commonly known as Siberian spelt, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, dark blue or black grains. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Its grains are encased in a tough, inedible hull, which requires special processing for use in baking. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is often used in traditional and artisanal food products."
