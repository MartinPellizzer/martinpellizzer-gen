    "intro": "Tragopogon kindingeri, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. Tragopogon kindingeri is also known for its ability to hybridize with other Tragopogon species, leading to the creation of new, often sterile, hybrid forms."
