    "intro": "Tereianthes, commonly known as the desert bean, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect or shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Tereianthes species are typically drought-tolerant, with deep root systems that allow them to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or white."
