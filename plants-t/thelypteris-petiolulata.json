It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Thelypteris petiolulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
