It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are typically short and clustered, providing protection against herbivores. Trichocereus tarmaensis is well adapted to arid and high-altitude environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil."
