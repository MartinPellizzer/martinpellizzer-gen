    "intro": "Taxillus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks and elms. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using sunlight. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can significantly impact the health of its host by draining resources. Its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in clusters, and it produces small, round berries that are often consumed by birds. Taxillus ferrugineus plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
