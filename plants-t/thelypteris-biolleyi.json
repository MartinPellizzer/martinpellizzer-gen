    "intro": "Thelypteris biolleyi, commonly known as the Biolley's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds. Thelypteris biolleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
