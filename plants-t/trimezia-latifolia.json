It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates."
