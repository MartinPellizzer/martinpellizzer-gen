    "intro": "Turraea baronii, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a rough, fissured bark. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface. Turraea baronii produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits that split open to release seeds."
