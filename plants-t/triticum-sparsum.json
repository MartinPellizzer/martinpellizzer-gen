    "intro": "Triticum sparsum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seeds are small and oval, with a hard outer coat that aids in seed dispersal. While not cultivated for grain, it plays a role in ecological systems and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
