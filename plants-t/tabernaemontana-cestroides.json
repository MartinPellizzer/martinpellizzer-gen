    "intro": "Tabernaemontana cestroides, commonly known as the clustered angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, grayish bark and produces clusters of fragrant blooms during the warm season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. However, it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, requiring caution in handling and cultivation."
