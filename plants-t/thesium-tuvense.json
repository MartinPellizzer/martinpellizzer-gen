    "intro": "Thesium tuvense, commonly known as the Tuven's thesium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, which includes plants known for their showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating. Thesium tuvense is adapted to the volcanic soils and coastal climates of its native habitat, making it a unique example of island endemism."
