It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often hairy, giving the plant its common name."
