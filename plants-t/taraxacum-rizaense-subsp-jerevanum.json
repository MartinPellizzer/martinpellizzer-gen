It features a rosette of basal, hairy, and spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that rises from the center of the rosette, bearing a single, large, yellow flower head composed of numerous ray florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in arid environments and is often found in mountainous areas of Armenia and adjacent regions."
