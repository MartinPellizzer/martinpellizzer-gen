    "intro": "Taraxacum euoplocarpum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, known as a pappus, which consists of bristly structures that aid in wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum euoplocarpum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its medicinal properties."
