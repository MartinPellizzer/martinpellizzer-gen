It is characterized by its showy, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a long, slender pod that splits open to release its seeds. Tynanthus densiflorus is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland edges."
