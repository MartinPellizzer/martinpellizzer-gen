    "intro": "Trifolium vesiculosum var. grisebachianum, commonly known as the gray-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically grayish-green in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
