    "intro": "Tillandsia pusilla, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a small bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on trees in tropical rainforests. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
