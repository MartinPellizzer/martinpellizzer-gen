    "intro": "Tonningia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts and acacias, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are elongated and opposite, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tonningia longifolia plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and birds."
