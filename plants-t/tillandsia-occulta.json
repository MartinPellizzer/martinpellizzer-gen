    "intro": "Tillandsia occulta, commonly known as the hidden air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This epiphytic plant thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, soil, and rain through its dense, fibrous root system. It is characterized by its compact rosette structure and elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which are typically hidden within the foliage. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, Tillandsia occulta is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
