    "intro": "Thrixspermum minimifolium, commonly known as the dwarf leaf thrixspermum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with tiny, ovate leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Thrixspermum minimifolium is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
