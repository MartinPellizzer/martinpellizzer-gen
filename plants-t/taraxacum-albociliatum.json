    "intro": "Taraxacum albociliatum, commonly known as the white-fringed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive white cilia on the leaves, which give it its common name. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects and a pioneer species in ecological succession."
