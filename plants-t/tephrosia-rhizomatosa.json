    "intro": "Tephrosia rhizomatosa, commonly known as the creeping tephrosia, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively and form dense ground cover. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Tephrosia rhizomatosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
