    "intro": "Trifolium caurinum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its dense clusters of small pink or purple flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Trifolium caurinum is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
