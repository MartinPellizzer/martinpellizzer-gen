    "intro": "Trochomeria macrocarpa var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia tree, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. This plant is adapted to extreme arid conditions, with specialized structures that help it conserve water and survive in harsh environments."
