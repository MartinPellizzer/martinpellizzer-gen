    "intro": "Tofieldia palustris var. vulgaris, commonly known as marsh lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist to aquatic environments, often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological structure of wetlands. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a role in both ecological and ornamental value."
