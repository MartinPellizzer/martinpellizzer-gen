    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. calciphilus, commonly known as the limestone thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky, calcareous soils in southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in limestone habitats. Its medicinal properties and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
