It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is known for its adaptability to harsh conditions and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
