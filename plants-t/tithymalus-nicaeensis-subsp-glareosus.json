    "intro": "Tithymalus nicaeensis subsp. glareosus, commonly known as the Nicaean tithymalus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive tubular shape that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. This subspecies is adapted to grow in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
