    "intro": "Trichoscypha beguei, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa and is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Trichoscypha beguei is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in furniture and construction."
