    "intro": "Thymus pusillus, commonly known as small thyme, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with compact, creeping or upright growth habits. The plant features tiny, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink or purple flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant. Thymus pusillus is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
