It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
