    "intro": "Tridens avenaceus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf panic grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a cover plant in ecological restoration projects."
