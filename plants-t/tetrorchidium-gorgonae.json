    "intro": "Tetrorchidium gorgonae, commonly known as the Gorgon's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of four elongated, fleshy spikes that bear numerous small, colorful flowers. The plant exhibits a complex morphology, with thick, succulent stems and broad, leathery leaves adapted to its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
