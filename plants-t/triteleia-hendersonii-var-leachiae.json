    "intro": "Triteleia hendersonii var. leachiae, commonly known as the Leach's glory-of-the-snow, is a bulbous perennial native to the coastal areas of California. It produces showy, white to pale blue flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal bluffs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
