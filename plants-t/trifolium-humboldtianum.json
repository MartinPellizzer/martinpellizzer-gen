    "intro": "Trifolium humboldtianum, commonly known as Humboldt's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous and forested areas. Trifolium humboldtianum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in traditional medicine."
