    "intro": "Thelypteris villana, commonly known as the fern of the genus Thelypteris, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with pinnate, often deeply divided fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions.
