    "intro": "Thalictrum angustifolium var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and elongated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
