It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
