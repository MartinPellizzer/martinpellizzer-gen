    "intro": "Taxillus liquidambaricola var. liquidambaricola, commonly known as the mistletoe of sweetgum, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of sweetgum trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and forms dense, hemispherical clusters on its host. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers followed by berries that are a source of food for birds. It lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its stems and leaves. This species is often found in warm, temperate regions where its host trees thrive."
