    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos proles spectabilis, commonly known as the showy large-leaved lime, is a variant of the large-leaved lime tree native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
