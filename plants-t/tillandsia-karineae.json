    "intro": "Tillandsia karineae, commonly known as the Karine's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is popular among indoor plant enthusiasts."
