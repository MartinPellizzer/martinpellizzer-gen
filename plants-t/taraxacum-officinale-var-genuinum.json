    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. genuinum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head known as a \"clock\" or \"puffball,\" which releases seeds via wind dispersal. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in lawns and gardens."
