    "intro": "Tillaea sieberiana, commonly known as the Sieber's tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the rocky environments of the western United States. It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Tillaea sieberiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
