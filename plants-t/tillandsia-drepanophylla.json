    "intro": "Tillandsia drepanophylla, commonly known as the panama hat air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, umbrella-like structure. Its leaves are thick and covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where traditional soil-based plants might struggle."
