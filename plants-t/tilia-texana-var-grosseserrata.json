    "intro": "Tilia texana var. grosseserrata, commonly known as the Texas large-leaf linden, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with coarsely serrated margins, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along streams. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is light and soft, making it suitable for carving and small crafts."
