    "intro": "Tillaea venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan tillia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Venezuela. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces distinctive, fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Tillaea venezuelensis thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
