    "intro": "Thilachium grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as dense forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
