    "intro": "Triticum durum var. leucura, commonly known as white durum wheat, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its pale, chalky endosperm. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for producing semolina used in pasta and couscous. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets. It is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a moderate amount of rainfall during its growing season. The grains are hard and have a low moisture content, contributing to their durability and storage life."
