It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, and it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with support structures. The flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
