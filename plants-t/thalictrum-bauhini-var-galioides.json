    "intro": "Thalictrum bauhini var. galioides, commonly known as the galioides variety of meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem and a preference for moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display, making it a popular choice for garden planting."
