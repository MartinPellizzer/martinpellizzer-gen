    "intro": "Trifolium cuspidatum, commonly known as narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Trifolium cuspidatum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
