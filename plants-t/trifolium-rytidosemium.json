    "intro": "Trifolium rytidosemium, commonly known as the scarlet trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in meadows and grasslands. Trifolium rytidosemium is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and supports other plant growth."
