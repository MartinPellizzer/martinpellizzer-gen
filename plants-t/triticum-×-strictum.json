    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 strictum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other wild grasses. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and long, narrow leaves, which are typical of many grass species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, each containing a single grain. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for genetic research due to its potential contributions to wheat improvement. Triticum \u00d7 strictum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, making it a resilient wild relative of cultivated wheat."
