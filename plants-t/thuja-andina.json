    "intro": "Thuja andina, commonly known as the Andean thuja, is a coniferous evergreen native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slow growth and dense, pyramidal shape, with scale-like leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, which are typically found on the female plants. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions. Thuja andina is also valued for its air-purifying properties and resistance to pests and diseases."
