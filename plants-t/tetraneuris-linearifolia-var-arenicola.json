    "intro": "Tetraneuris linearifolia var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
