    "intro": "Thelypteris minuscula, commonly known as the small fern, is a small, delicate fern native to various regions in the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dichotomous fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris minuscula plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
