    "intro": "Teucrium barbarum, commonly known as field germander, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Teucrium barbarum is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic benefits."
