    "intro": "Trifolium rubellum, commonly known as the red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a red or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Trifolium rubellum is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, improving soil fertility."
