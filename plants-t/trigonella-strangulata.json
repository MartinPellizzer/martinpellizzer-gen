    "intro": "Trigonella strangulata, commonly known as the strangling trigonella, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant often grows in a shrub-like form. Trigonella strangulata is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
