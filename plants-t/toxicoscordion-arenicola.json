    "intro": "Toxicoscordion arenicola, commonly known as the desert deathwhisk, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, containing potent cardiac glycosides that can be lethal to livestock and humans. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed and sandy soils. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
