    "intro": "Thorelia deglupta, commonly known as the tropical orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South and Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Thorelia deglupta typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its botanical significance lies in its role within tropical ecosystems and its value in horticultural collections."
