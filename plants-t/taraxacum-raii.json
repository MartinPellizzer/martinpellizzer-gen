    "intro": "Taraxacum raii, commonly known as the Persian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Central Asia, including Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangements. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, forming a single bloom that opens in the spring, followed by the characteristic seed dispersal via a pappus. Taraxacum raii is often found in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
