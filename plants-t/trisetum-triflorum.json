    "intro": "Trisetum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered setgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear three small, spike-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. Trisetum triflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
