    "intro": "Timonius pseudaffinis, commonly known as the false timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
