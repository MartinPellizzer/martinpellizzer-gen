    "intro": "Tracaulon perfoliatum, commonly known as the perforate tracaulon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, sometimes hairy stems that can perforate the leaves of other plants, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Tracaulon perfoliatum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks."
