    "intro": "Tetraglochin striosa, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in dense undergrowth. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
