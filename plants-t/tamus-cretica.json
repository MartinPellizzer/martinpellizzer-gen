    "intro": "Tamus cretica, commonly known as the common arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Tamus cretica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
