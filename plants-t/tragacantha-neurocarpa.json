    "intro": "Tragacantha neurocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods. Its sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
