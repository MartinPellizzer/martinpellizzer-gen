    "intro": "Toxicodendron acuminatum, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to various parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with stinging hairs that release irritants when touched. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it reproduces through both sexual and vegetative means. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine, though its defensive properties make it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
