    "intro": "Thompsonia, commonly known as the Thompson's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its fragility and habitat loss, Thompsonia is listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for continued research and protection."
