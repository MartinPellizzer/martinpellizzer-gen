    "intro": "Tripogon lanatus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
