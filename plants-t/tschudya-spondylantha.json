    "intro": "Tschudya spondylantha, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, fluffy seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Tschudya spondylantha is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
