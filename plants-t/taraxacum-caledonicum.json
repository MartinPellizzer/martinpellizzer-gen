    "intro": "Taraxacum caledonicum, commonly known as the Caledonian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, hairy stem topped with a bright yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, a fluffy structure that aids in aerial distribution. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in alpine and rocky habitats."
