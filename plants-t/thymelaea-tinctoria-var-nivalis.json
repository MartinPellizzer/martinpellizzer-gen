    "intro": "Thymelaea tinctoria var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow thymelaea, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and Pyrenees. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, rounded, fleshy fruits known as follicles, which contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
