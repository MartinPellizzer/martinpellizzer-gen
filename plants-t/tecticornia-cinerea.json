    "intro": "Tecticornia cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a compact structure that minimizes surface area for evaporation. It produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Tecticornia cinerea is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland saltbush habitats."
