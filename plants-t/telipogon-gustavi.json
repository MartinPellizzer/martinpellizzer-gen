    "intro": "Telipogon gustavi, commonly known as the Gustav's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and elongated petals that are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter and good drainage. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon gustavi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
