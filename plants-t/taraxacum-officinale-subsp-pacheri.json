It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into spiky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky and alpine habitats, often growing at elevations above 1,500 meters. This subspecies is notable for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate cold and poor soil conditions."
