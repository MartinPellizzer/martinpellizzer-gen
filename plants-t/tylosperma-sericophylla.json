    "intro": "Tylosperma sericophylla, commonly known as the silky-leaf tamarind, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
