    "intro": "Trichosanthes colubrina, commonly known as the snake gourd, is a flowering vine native to Asia and Africa. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash. The plant produces large, warty, green fruits that mature to a dark yellow or orange color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive purple throat. The fruit is edible when mature but is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
