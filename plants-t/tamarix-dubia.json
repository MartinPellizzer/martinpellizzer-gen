    "intro": "Tamarix dubia, commonly known as the desert rose, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces delicate pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tamarix dubia is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
