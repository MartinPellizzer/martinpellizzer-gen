    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Thelypteris hydrophila and Thelypteris dilatata. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, lanceolate leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help in anchoring the plant to the substrate while also facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with fertile pinnae bearing sporangia on the underside, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
