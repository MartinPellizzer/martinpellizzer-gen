    "intro": "Tragacantha anthylloides, commonly known as the Persian gum or white tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its sap, which is rich in gum tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
