    "intro": "Trichomanes radicans var. birmanicum, commonly known as the Bornean walking fern, is a variant of the walking fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow the plant to spread along the forest floor. The fronds are typically narrow and linear, with a distinct midrib and small, clustered sporangia on the underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
