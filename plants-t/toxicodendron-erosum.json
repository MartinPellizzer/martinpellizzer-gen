    "intro": "Toxicodendron erosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of urushiol, a potent allergenic oil. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is native to parts of North America. Its leaves are typically oval with a rough, sandpapery texture, and it can grow as either a shrub or a climbing vine. Toxicodendron erosum is known for causing severe skin irritation in individuals sensitive to urushiol."
