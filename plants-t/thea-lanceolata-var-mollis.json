It features lance-shaped leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
