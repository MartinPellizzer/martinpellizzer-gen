    "intro": "Tetranthera borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tetranthera, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that contain several seeds, facilitating seed dispersal by wind or animals. Tetranthera borneensis is often found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
