    "intro": "Typhonium divaricatum var. schottii, commonly known as the Schott's arrowhead, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for efficient water retention in humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers that are often borne on a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
