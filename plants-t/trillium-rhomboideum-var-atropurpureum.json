    "intro": "Trillium rhomboideum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered wake-robin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy purple or pinkish-white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies and beetles, and it thrives in rich, moist, acidic soils under partial to full shade. The plant is often found in woodlands and is considered a valuable component of native plant communities."
