    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
