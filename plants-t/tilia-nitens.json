    "intro": "Tilia nitens, commonly known as the white-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green and covered in fine white hairs. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Tilia nitens is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
