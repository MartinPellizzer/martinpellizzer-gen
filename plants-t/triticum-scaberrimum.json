    "intro": "Triticum scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough wheat, is a species of wild wheat that is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous short, awned glumes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which contributes to its common name. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
