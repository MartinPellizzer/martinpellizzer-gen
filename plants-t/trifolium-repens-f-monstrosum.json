    "intro": "Trifolium repens f. monstrosum, commonly known as the giant white clover, is a variant of the common white clover. It is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves and flowers compared to the typical species. This plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its trifoliate leaves are usually bright white or pale green, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers. It is often used in lawns and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen."
