    "intro": "Taraxacum tenuilinguatum, commonly known as the slender-tongued dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed sphere. Native to eastern North America, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive through harsh conditions. Its flowers bloom in the spring and early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator ecosystems."
