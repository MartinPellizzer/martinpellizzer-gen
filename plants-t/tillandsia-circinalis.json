    "intro": "Tillandsia circinalis, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright pink or red flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil, making it a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardening. Its unique ability to absorb water through its leaves makes it well adapted to epiphytic growth on trees and rocks."
