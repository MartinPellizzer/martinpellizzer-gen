    "intro": "Tiglium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy tiglium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a typical feature of the Papaveraceae family. Tiglium pubescens is native to parts of Asia and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats."
