    "intro": "Trichoceros onaensis, commonly known as the Onaensis trichoceros, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure and foliage. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trichoceros onaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
