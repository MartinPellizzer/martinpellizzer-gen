    "intro": "Trichophyllum albidum, commonly known as the white trichophyllum, is a rare and delicate lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its pale, almost white thallus with a distinctive, wrinkled surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, which together provide the necessary nutrients for survival. It is typically found on decaying wood or stone in temperate forest regions. Due to its fragile nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
