    "intro": "Trifolium gymnocarpon, commonly known as the naked-carpel trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three leaflets, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Trifolium gymnocarpon is often found in fynbos vegetation and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
