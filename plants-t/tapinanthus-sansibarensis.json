    "intro": "Tapinanthus sansibarensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself via haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a fibrous, creeping stem that can spread over the host. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and shrubs in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be invasive and detrimental to the health of its host plants."
