    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudohirtellum, commonly known as the hirsute dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, elongated flower stem topped with a spherical seed head. Native to eastern North America, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces yellow flowers that develop into white, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is notable for its distinctive hirsute (hairy) foliage, which sets it apart from other dandelion species."
