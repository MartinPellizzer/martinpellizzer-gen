    "intro": "Tradescantia leiandra var. ovata, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a species of flowering plant in the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its upright, sword-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of green or purple, which are followed by berries. It is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that thrives in a variety of light conditions and is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying properties. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a versatile choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
