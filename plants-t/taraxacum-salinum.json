It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to grow in salty soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of saline ecosystems."
