    "intro": "Trichilia columnata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale to dark grey bark that often has a flaky or peeling appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oblong, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
