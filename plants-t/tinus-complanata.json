    "intro": "Tinus complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf tinus, is a species of flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are flat and broad, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Tinus complanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, daisy-like blooms."
