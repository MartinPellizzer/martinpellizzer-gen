    "intro": "Turbinicarpus macrochele subsp. frailensis, commonly known as the Frailensis Turbinicarpus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
