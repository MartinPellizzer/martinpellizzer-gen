    "intro": "Tragacantha spartioides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be used in traditional medicine. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability. Tragacantha spartioides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
