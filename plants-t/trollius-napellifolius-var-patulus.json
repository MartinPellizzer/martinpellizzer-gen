    "intro": "Trollius napellifolius var. patulus, commonly known as the broadleaf globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has deeply lobed, palmate leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and foliage make it a distinctive addition to alpine gardens and botanical collections."
