    "intro": "Triticum pungens subsp. obtusiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wild wheat, is a grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research."
