    "intro": "Tricalysia sylvae, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, giving the plant a feathery appearance. Its showy, clustered flowers are typically red or orange, with a distinctive, flame-like shape that attracts pollinators. The plant is well adapted to seasonal climates and is often found in savannas and woodlands."
