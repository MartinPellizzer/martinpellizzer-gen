It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant features fleshy, tuberous roots that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
