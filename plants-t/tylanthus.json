    "intro": "Tylanthus, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These trees are native to the Americas and are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. The leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the plant produces pods that contain seeds. Tylanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their dramatic floral displays and adaptability to various climates. They also play a role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
