    "intro": "Trigonella noeana f. tricarpa, commonly known as the three-seeded fenugreek, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the fenugreek genus. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive three-lobed pods, which give it its specific epithet \"tricarpa.\" Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
