    "intro": "Taraxacum rupicaprae, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a distinctive yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets, which later develops into a spherical, wind-dispersed seed ball. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
