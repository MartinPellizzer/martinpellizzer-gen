    "intro": "Thymelaea nitida var. segobricensis, commonly known as the Segobric Mountain Thymelaea, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
