    "intro": "Tectaria fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fringed margins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Tectaria fimbriata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
