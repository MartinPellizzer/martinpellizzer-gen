    "intro": "Tissa salina var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high levels of soil salinity. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and enhance salt excretion. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, greenish flowers that attract pollinators. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in arid and coastal regions."
