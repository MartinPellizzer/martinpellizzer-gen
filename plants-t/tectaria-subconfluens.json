    "intro": "Tectaria subconfluens, commonly known as the broad-leaf tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, rugged texture. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or soil, often in montane or lowland forest habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Tectaria subconfluens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
