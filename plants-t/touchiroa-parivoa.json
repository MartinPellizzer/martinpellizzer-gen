    "intro": "Touchiroa parivoa, commonly known as the Tahitian starflower, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its stems are often woody and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
