    "intro": "Trisetum subspicatum var. breviglume, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
