    "intro": "Treisia hystrix, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in its ecological interactions."
