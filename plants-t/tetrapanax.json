    "intro": "Tetrapanax, commonly known as the \"Chinese evergreen,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its unique, palm-like leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a waxy texture. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Tetrapanax species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature among araceous plants."
