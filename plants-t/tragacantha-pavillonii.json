    "intro": "Tragacantha pavillonii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its scientific name refers to the genus Tragacantha, which includes species known for their resinous sap. This plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
