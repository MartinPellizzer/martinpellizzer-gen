    "intro": "Tragacantha deluensis, commonly known as the Deluensian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its most notable feature is the production of a gelatinous substance from its pods, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Tragacantha deluensis is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and a slow growth rate."
