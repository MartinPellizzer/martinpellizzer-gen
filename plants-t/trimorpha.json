It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. Trimorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
