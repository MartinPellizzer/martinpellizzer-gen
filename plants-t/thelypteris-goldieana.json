    "intro": "Thelypteris goldieana, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris goldieana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
