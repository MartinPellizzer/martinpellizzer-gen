It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a dense, spiral arrangement around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained sandy soils. Its unique spiral growth pattern makes it a distinctive and attractive addition to rock gardens or succulent collections."
