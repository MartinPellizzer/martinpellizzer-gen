    "intro": "Taraxacum rhodomaurum, commonly known as the red-sepal dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed ball, aiding in wind dispersal. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it thrives in well-drained soils in open habitats. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelions and related plants."
