    "intro": "Thrasya ciliatifolia, commonly known as the hairy-leaved thrasya, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
