    "intro": "Toxopteris borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean sword fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration."
