    "intro": "Tragus racemosus var. major, commonly known as the greater tragus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its hardy nature makes it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
