    "intro": "Triticum durum var. sphaeroafricanum, commonly known as the African durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. It is native to Africa and exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter, stiffer stems compared to other durum wheat varieties. The plant produces small, hard grains that are well-suited for processing into semolina, a key ingredient in pasta and couscous. Its botanical traits include a robust root system and a high tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to arid environments. This variety is of particular interest in agricultural research for its potential in enhancing food security in semi-arid regions."
