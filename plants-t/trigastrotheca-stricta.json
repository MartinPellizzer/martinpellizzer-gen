    "intro": "Trigastrotheca stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling inflorescence that resembles a waterwheel. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a smooth or slightly waxy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, with a spathe that encloses the spadix, a feature common in many arum family plants."
