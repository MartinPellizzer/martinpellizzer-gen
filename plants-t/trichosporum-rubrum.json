    "intro": "Trichosporum rubrum, commonly known as the red beard lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its bright red to orange thallus, which is often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides it with nutrients through photosynthesis. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. Trichosporum rubrum is known for its slow growth and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
