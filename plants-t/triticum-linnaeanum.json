    "intro": "Triticum linnaeanum, commonly known as Linnaean wheat, is a species of wheat native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it produces achenes as its fruiting structure. Botanically, it is notable for its role in the study of plant taxonomy due to its historical significance in the works of Carl Linnaeus."
