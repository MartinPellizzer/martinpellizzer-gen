It is a small evergreen tree belonging to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its elliptical leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round pods that contain bitter, dark seeds used in the production of chocolate. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
