    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. rubescens, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a red or pink tinge. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and pastures. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
