    "intro": "Telipogon isabelae, commonly known as Isabel's grass, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species from threats such as habitat loss and invasive species."
