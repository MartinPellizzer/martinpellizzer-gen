    "intro": "Tillandsia stenoura var. stenoura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
