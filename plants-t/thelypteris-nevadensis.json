    "intro": "Thelypteris nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris nevadensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
