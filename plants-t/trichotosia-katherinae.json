    "intro": "Trichotosia katherinae, commonly known as the Katherina's trichotosia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
