    "intro": "Taraxacum perenne, commonly known as the perennial dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, prominent flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are pollinated by insects. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a \"puffball.\" This plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and meadows."
