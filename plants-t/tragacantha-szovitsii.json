    "intro": "Tragacantha szovitsii, commonly known as the Hungarian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark and roots contain a resinous substance known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
