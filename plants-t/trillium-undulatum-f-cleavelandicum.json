    "intro": "Trillium undulatum f. cleavelandicum, commonly known as the Cleaveland's wavy trillium, is a rare and striking botanical variant of the wavy trillium. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy-edged leaves and showy, three-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. This fern-like plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
