    "intro": "Tiquilia nuttallii, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 inches, featuring woody stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Tiquilia nuttallii is adapted to arid environments, with small leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
