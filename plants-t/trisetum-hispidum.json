    "intro": "Trisetum hispidum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stalks that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Trisetum hispidum is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
