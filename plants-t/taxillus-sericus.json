    "intro": "Taxillus sericus, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees such as mango and neem. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, bushy growth that can cover large areas of the host's canopy. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in clusters and are followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. Taxillus sericus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
