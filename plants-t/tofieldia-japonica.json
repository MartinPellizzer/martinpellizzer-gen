    "intro": "Tofieldia japonica, commonly known as Japanese tofieldia, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spikes of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Tofieldia japonica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
