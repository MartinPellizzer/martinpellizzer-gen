    "intro": "Trifolium reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium reflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
