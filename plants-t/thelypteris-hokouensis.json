It is native to China, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Hubei and Hainan provinces. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green to bluish-green coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Thelypteris hokouensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
