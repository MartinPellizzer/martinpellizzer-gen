    "intro": "Thelypteris comptula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris comptula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
