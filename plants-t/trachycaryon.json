    "intro": "Trachycaryon, commonly known as the woolly beggar-tick, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Trachycaryon is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is common in temperate regions. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
