    "intro": "Tillandsia zarumensis, commonly known as the Zarumense air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
