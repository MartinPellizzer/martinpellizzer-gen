    "intro": "Trichera dumetorum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Trichera dumetorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
