    "intro": "Thouinia revoluta, commonly known as the revolute thouinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters at the ends of the stems. Its foliage is characterized by a distinctive revolute margin, where the edges of the leaves curl under, giving it its common name. Thouinia revoluta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
