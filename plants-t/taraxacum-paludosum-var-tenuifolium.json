    "intro": "Taraxacum paludosum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slenderleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to wet meadows and marshy areas in North America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces a single, upright stem topped with a spherical, yellow composite flower head. Its flowers open in the spring and are followed by a pappus-based seed dispersal mechanism. This variety is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands."
