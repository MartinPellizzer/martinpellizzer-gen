    "intro": "Tectaria pseudosiifolia, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. Tectaria pseudosiifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
