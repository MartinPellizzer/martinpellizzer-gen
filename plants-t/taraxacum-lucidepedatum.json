    "intro": "Taraxacum lucidepedatum, commonly known as the shining footed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces a distinctive seed head that releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. The species is notable for its clear, waxy coating on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
