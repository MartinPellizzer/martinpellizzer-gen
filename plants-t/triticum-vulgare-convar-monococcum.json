    "intro": "Triticum vulgare convar. monococcum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is a primitive species of wheat with a unique botanical structure. It is a diploid species with a genome size of 14 chromosomes, making it genetically simpler than modern wheat varieties. The plant features a slender stem, alternate leaves with a rough texture, and spikelets that bear small, awned grains. Its seeds are encased in a tough, inedible hull that must be removed for consumption. Einkorn wheat is notable for its high protein content and nutritional value, making it a valuable crop in both historical and modern agricultural contexts."
