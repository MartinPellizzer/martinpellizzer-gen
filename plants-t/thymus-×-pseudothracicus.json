    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 pseudothracicus, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Thymus serpyllum and Thymus praecox."
