    "intro": "Tritonia flabellifolia var. thomasiae, commonly known as Thomas's bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Western Cape Province. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in spring, often with a distinctive white throat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
