    "intro": "Trichosporum copelandii, commonly known as the copeland's trichosporum, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that provide a striking contrast to its delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Trichosporum copelandii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
