    "intro": "Tylanthus litoralis, commonly known as the seaside tylanthus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in salty environments. Tylanthus litoralis is adapted to withstand wind, salt spray, and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
