    "intro": "Trapa wolgensis, commonly known as the Tibetan water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves, which are broad and heart-shaped, and its distinctive spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow waters and is often found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in supporting local aquatic ecosystems. Trapa wolgensis is also valued for its nutritional content and traditional uses in some Asian cultures."
