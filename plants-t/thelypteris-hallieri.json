    "intro": "Thelypteris hallieri, commonly known as the Haller's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. Thelypteris hallieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
