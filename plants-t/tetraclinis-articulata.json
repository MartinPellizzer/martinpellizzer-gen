    "intro": "Tetraclinis articulata, commonly known as the juniper tree or false cypress, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, cone-like fruits. The plant is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing on limestone soils. Its slow growth rate and resilience make it a valuable component of Mediterranean ecosystems. The wood of Tetraclinis articulata is highly aromatic and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a source of incense and medicinal applications."
