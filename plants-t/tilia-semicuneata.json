    "intro": "Tilia semicuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round, greenish fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Tilia semicuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
