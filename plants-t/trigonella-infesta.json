    "intro": "Trigonella infesta, commonly known as the Indian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are small, oval, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Trigonella infesta is also valued as a forage crop for livestock due to its nutritional content and hardiness."
