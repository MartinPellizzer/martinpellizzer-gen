    "intro": "Tetragastris occhionii, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and white, typically clustered in panicles, and it produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Tetragastris occhionii is considered a threatened species in its native range."
