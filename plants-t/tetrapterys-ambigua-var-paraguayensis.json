    "intro": "Tetrapterys ambigua var. paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making. The plant also plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
