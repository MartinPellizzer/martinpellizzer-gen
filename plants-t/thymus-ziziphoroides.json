    "intro": "Thymus ziziphoroides, commonly known as Turkish thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, pungent scent, which is attributed to its high concentration of essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a member of the Lamiaceae family, sharing traits with other aromatic herbs."
