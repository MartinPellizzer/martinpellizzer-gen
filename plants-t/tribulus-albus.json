It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Its fruit is a hairy capsule that contains several small, white seeds. Tribulus albus is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
