    "intro": "Triticum persicum var. coeruleum, commonly known as Persian wheat or blue wheat, is a unique variant of wheat characterized by its striking blue-gray glumes. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include slender, spike-like inflorescences and small, wind-pollinated flowers. The blue hue of its bracts is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are common in certain grass species. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely cultivated for grain production."
