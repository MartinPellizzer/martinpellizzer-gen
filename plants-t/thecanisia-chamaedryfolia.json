    "intro": "Thecanisia chamaedryfolia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Thecanisia chamaedryfolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
