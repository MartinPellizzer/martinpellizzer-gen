    "intro": "Thelypteris raddii, commonly known as the red-tailed brake, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris raddii plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
