    "intro": "Taraxacum vereinense, commonly known as the Austrian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The species is noted for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
