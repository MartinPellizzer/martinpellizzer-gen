    "intro": "Taraxacum paucisquamosum, commonly known as the sparse-squamate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically growing in dry, open habitats. Its leaves are covered with few small, scale-like hairs, giving it its specific epithet. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
