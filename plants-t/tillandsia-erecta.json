    "intro": "Tillandsia erecta, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It does not require soil for nourishment, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant features dense, hanging clusters of thread-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. It is often found on trees in the southeastern United States and parts of South America. Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host."
