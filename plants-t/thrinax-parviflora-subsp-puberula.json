    "intro": "Thrinax parviflora subsp. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent palm, is a small, cold-hardy palm native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, clustered stems and stiff, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by yellow, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or container planting. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture in mild climates."
