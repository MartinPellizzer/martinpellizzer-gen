    "intro": "Tulbaghia africana, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to Mediterranean climates and thrives in well-drained soil. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Tulbaghia africana is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
