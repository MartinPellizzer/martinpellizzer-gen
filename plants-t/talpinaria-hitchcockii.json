It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheats and sorrels. The plant is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
