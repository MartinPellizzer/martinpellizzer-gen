    "intro": "Trichomanes bilingue, commonly known as the two-language fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This epiphytic plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually closely spaced and have a soft, velvety texture. Trichomanes bilingue is notable for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in humid climates."
