    "intro": "Thalictrum kemense var. stipellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are narrow and arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family."
