    "intro": "Trollius pumilus var. tanguticus, commonly known as the Tibetan globeflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly layer of hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and valuable species in alpine botany."
