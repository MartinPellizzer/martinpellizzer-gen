It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or other surfaces, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
