It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
