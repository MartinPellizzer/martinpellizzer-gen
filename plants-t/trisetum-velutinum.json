    "intro": "Trisetum velutinum, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, bogs, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, cylindrical spikelet that is often covered in short, bristly hairs. Trisetum velutinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
