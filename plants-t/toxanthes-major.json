    "intro": "Toxanthes major, commonly known as the giant toxanthe, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features strap-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. Its bulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in arid conditions. Toxanthes major is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and ample sunlight."
