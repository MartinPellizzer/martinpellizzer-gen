    "intro": "Tibetiodes techinensis, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
