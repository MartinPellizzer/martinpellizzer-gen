    "intro": "Tribulus maximus, commonly known as goat's head, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a sprawling perennial shrub that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its prickly stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive red, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported aphrodisiac and medicinal properties."
