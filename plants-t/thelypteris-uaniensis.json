    "intro": "Thelypteris uaniensis, commonly known as the Uanai fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or pendulous. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris uaniensis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
