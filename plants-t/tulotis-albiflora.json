    "intro": "Tulotis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered tulotis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle elegance to its natural habitat. Tulotis albiflora thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both wildflower gardens and botanical collections."
