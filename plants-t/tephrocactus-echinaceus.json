    "intro": "Tephrocactus echinaceus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, spine-tipped cactus that typically forms dense clusters. The plant has pale green, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in late spring. Tephrocactus echinaceus is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
