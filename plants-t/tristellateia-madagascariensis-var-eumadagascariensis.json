    "intro": "Tristellateia madagascariensis var. eumadagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers with a star-shaped appearance, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
