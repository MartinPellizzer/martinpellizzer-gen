    "intro": "Thalictrum gallicum proles medianum, commonly known as the middle-leaf meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along its stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects and native plant gardens."
