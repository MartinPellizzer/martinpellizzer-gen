    "intro": "Trifolium glomeratum var. duodecimnerve, commonly known as the twelve-veined clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive twelve-veined pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the legume family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
