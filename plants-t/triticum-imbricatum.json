    "intro": "Triticum imbricatum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, protective husk, which helps in seed dispersal and survival in various environmental conditions. Triticum imbricatum is considered an important wild relative of cultivated wheat species due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation."
