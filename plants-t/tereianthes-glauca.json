    "intro": "Tereianthes glauca, commonly known as the silverleaf tereianthes, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, papery leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain its seeds. Tereianthes glauca is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
