    "intro": "Taraxacum dissectiforme, commonly known as the dissected dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive, almost lacy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
