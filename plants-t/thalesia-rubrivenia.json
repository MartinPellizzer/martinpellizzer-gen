It is characterized by its striking red veins that run through its broad, glossy green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the late spring and early summer. Its unique vascular patterns make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
