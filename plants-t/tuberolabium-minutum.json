    "intro": "Tuberolabium minutum, commonly known as the small-flowered tuberous labium, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, tuberous roots and compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces delicate, spurred flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctive labellum structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tuberolabium minutum is considered a vulnerable species."
