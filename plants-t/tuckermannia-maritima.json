    "intro": "Tuckermannia maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plumbagaceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray leaves, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained conditions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for coastal dunes and rocky shores. Tuckermannia maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
