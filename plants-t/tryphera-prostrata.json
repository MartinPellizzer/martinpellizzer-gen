    "intro": "Tryphera prostrata, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry conditions."
