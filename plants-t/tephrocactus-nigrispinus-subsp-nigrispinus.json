    "intro": "Tephrocactus nigrispinus subsp. nigrispinus, commonly known as the black-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in dark, spiny tubercles. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the areoles. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark spines and compact growth habit, making it a unique addition to cactus collections."
