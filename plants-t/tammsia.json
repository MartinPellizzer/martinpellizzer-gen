    "intro": "Tammsia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic genus of ferns belonging to the family Tmesipteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Tammsia is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores in specialized structures called sorus. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tammsia is considered a conservation concern and is often found in protected areas."
