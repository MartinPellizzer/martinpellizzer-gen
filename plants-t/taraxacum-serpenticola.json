    "intro": "Taraxacum serpenticola, commonly known as the serpent's tail dandelion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often curling leaves that resemble a serpent's tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
