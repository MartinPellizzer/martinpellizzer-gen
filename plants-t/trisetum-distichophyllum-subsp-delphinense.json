It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it has a fibrous root system. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
