    "intro": "Trichosanthes ellipsoidea, commonly known as the Chinese lantern gourd, is a vining plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, pumpkins, and gourds. The plant produces large, orange, inflated fruits that resemble lanterns, which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and trailing. The flowers are typically yellow with a distinct, fleshy calyx that persists even after the fruit matures."
