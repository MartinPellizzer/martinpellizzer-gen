    "intro": "Taxus canadensis f. stricta, commonly known as the Canadian yew, is a rare and compact form of the yew tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and dark green, needle-like foliage. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
