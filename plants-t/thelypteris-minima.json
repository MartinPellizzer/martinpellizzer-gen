    "intro": "Thelypteris minima, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows along the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
