    "intro": "Tolumnia calochila, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
