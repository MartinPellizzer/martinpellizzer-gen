    "intro": "Tilia leptocarya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more elongated compared to other lime species. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, round fruits called samaras. This species is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
