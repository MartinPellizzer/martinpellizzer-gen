    "intro": "Thlaspi apetalum, commonly known as the yellow rocket, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Thlaspi apetalum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
