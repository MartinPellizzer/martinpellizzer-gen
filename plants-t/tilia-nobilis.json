    "intro": "Tilia nobilis, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other linden species. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia nobilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its honey-producing flowers."
