    "intro": "Taraxacum lobulatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a spherical, white seed ball with bristly hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a common and recognizable member of the dandelion family (Asteraceae)."
