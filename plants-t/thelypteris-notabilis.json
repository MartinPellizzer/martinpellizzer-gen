    "intro": "Thelypteris notabilis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Thelypteris notabilis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
