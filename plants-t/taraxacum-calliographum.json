It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy white seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum calliographum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
