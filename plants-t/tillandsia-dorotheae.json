    "intro": "Tillandsia dorotheae, commonly known as the Dorothea air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
