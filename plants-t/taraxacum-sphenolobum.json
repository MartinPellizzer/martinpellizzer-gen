    "intro": "Taraxacum sphenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens. The species is notable for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
