    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. pruinosum, commonly known as the silky avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, showy flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in an umbel-like structure. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a delicate, shade-tolerant plant."
