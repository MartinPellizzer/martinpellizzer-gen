    "intro": "Trifolium pratense proles nivale, commonly known as the snow clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. This plant is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion and contributes to nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
