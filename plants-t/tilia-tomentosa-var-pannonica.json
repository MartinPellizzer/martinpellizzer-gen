    "intro": "Tilia tomentosa var. pannonica, commonly known as the Pannonian lime, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white bark and heart-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber and honey production."
