    "intro": "Taraxacum epacroides, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it typically grows in dry, open areas. The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that develop into spiky, wind-dispersed seeds. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed soils. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
