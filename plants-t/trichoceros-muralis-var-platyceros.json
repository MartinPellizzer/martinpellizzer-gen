    "intro": "Trichoceros muralis var. platyceros, commonly known as the broad-crested wall fern, is a variant of the wall fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often recurved and covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or walls, where it can absorb moisture from the environment. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. The leaves are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, making it a striking addition to shaded, humid environments."
