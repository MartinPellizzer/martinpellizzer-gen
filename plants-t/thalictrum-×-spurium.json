    "intro": "Thalictrum \u00d7 spurium, commonly known as the meadow rue hybrid, is a perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Thalictrum \u00d7 spurium is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and stream banks across temperate regions."
