    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role in supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
