    "intro": "Triglochin centrocarpa var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf spikerush, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered spikes of flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its rhizomes help it spread vegetatively. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil."
