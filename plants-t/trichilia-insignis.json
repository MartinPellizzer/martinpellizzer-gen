    "intro": "Trichilia insignis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing elliptical seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
