    "intro": "Taxus occidentalis, commonly known as the western yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, reddish-pink seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-colored aril, which is dispersed by birds. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark brown, providing some protection against environmental stress. Taxus occidentalis is also notable for containing taxanes, a group of compounds with potential medicinal uses, including in cancer treatments."
