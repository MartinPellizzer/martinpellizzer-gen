    "intro": "Tragacantha cataonica, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces a viscous gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
