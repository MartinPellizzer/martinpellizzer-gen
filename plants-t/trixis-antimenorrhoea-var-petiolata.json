    "intro": "Trixis antimenorrhoea var. petiolata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand prolonged droughts. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local communities."
