    "intro": "Thymus striatus var. acicularis, commonly known as the needle-thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically needle-like in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant foliage and drought tolerance."
