    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as mountain thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It is also valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, similar to other thyme species."
