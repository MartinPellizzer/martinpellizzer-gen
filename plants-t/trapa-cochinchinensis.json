    "intro": "Trapa cochinchinensis, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves with long, narrow petioles and produces distinctive spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its roots help stabilize soil, preventing erosion in aquatic habitats. The fruit's unique structure aids in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
