    "intro": "Torularia dentata, commonly known as the toothed torula, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. The plant is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
