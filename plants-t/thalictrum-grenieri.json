    "intro": "Thalictrum grenieri, commonly known as the showy meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Thalictrum grenieri is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
