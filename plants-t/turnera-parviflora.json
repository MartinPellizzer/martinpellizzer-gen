    "intro": "Turnera parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered turnera, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and is often found in humid, tropical climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Turnera parviflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
