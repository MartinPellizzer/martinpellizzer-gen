    "intro": "Taraxacum dissectissimum, commonly known as the dissected dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a single flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its flowers are followed by a spherical, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. Native to Europe, this species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
