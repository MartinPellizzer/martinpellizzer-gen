    "intro": "Taraxacum oligolobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial, with a taproot that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its floral structure and leaf morphology make it distinct from other dandelion species within the genus."
