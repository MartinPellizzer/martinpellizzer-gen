    "intro": "Tillandsia secunda var. secunda, commonly known as the silver vernal, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pale purple flowers, adding to its ornamental value."
