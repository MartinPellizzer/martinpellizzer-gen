    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf white trillium, is a rare and delicate perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features three heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Trillium grandiflorum. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
