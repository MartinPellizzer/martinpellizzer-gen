    "intro": "Tapinanthus keniae, commonly known as the Kenyan dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to eastern Africa, particularly Kenya. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a weak, vine-like structure that allows it to attach to its host. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, such as grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant stress to its host, sometimes leading to reduced growth or even death."
