    "intro": "Torenia ovata, commonly known as the trumpet flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, violet-blue flowers that resemble small trumpets, often with a contrasting yellow throat. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Torenia ovata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
