    "intro": "Taxus fastigiata, commonly known as the upright yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its dense, columnar growth habit and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in two rows. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature over several years, releasing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Taxus fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in formal garden settings. It is also noted for its high toxicity, containing compounds that are harmful to humans and animals."
