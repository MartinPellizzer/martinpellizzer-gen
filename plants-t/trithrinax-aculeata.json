    "intro": "Trithrinax aculeata, commonly known as the spiny palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of narrow, stiff leaves that are often covered in sharp spines. The plant is well adapted to coastal and dry environments, showing resilience to salt spray and drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Trithrinax aculeata plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
