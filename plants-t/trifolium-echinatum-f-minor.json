    "intro": "Trifolium echinatum f. minor, commonly known as the lesser hairy vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, grassy areas and is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This plant is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a food source for certain pollinators."
