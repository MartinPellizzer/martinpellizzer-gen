    "intro": "Telipogon pachensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its small size and specific habitat requirements make it particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species from extinction."
