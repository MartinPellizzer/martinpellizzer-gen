It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and showy, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitat."
