    "intro": "Taraxacum porteri, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in a white waxy coating. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring, producing a distinctive seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. Taraxacum porteri is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
