    "intro": "Tiarocarpus hymenostephanus, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its scent and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. The species is also noted for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils and its role in local ecosystems."
