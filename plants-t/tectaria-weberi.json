    "intro": "Tectaria weberi, commonly known as the Weber's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern."
