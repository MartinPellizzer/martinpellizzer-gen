    "intro": "Triticum polonicum var. tibeticum, commonly known as Tibetan triticum, is a wild wheat species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptation to cold, arid environments. The plant typically features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. It has a high genetic diversity, making it a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience. This variety is also of interest for its potential role in sustainable agriculture in harsh climates."
