    "intro": "Thymus neiceffii, commonly known as the Sicilian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves are used in cooking and traditional medicine, similar to other thyme species."
