    "intro": "Tofieldia fusca f. rishiriensis, commonly known as the Rishiri lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Rishiri in Japan. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream edges. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. This unique species plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
