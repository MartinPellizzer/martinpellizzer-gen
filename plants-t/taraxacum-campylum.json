    "intro": "Taraxacum campylum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which later develop into the familiar seed-filled spheres. It thrives in a variety of soils and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, making it a common sight in many temperate regions."
