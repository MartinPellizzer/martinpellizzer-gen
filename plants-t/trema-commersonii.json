It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a unique floral structure typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Trema commersonii is often found in moist, tropical or subtropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
