    "intro": "Trifolium monanthum subsp. tenerum, commonly known as the soft-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its low-growing habit and attractive foliage, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
