    "intro": "Trifolium raddeanum, commonly known as the Siberian clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Trifolium raddeanum is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
