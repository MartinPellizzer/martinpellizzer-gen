    "intro": "Trixis, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Trixis is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
