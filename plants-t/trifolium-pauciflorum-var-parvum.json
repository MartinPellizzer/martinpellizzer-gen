    "intro": "Trifolium pauciflorum var. parvum, commonly known as the small-flowered clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
