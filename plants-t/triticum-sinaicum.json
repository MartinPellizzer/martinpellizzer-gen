    "intro": "Triticum sinaicum, commonly known as the Sinai wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear narrow, awned glumes. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its grains are small and hard, with a high protein content, making it potentially valuable for breeding purposes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
