    "intro": "Tetraplasandra flynnii, commonly known as the Flynn's tetraplasandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and broad, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Tetraplasandra flynnii is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
