    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. induratus, commonly known as hardy thyme or stone thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically grey-green in color, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, pale purple or pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and medicinal herb gardens. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
