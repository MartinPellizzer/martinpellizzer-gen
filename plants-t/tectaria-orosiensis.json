    "intro": "Tectaria orosiensis, commonly known as the Orosi fern, is a species of polypodiales native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rainforests. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous aerial roots, which help it anchor to tree trunks or rocks. Tectaria orosiensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
