    "intro": "Tillandsia rubida, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding striking visual appeal. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees or rocks without requiring soil. Tillandsia rubida is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
