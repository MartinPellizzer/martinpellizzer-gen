    "intro": "Tepuia cardonae, commonly known as the cardon cactus, is a rare and striking plant native to the Sonoran Desert. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Tepuia cardonae is adapted to extreme arid conditions, storing water in its fleshy stems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
