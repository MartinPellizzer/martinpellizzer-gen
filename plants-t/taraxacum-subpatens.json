    "intro": "Taraxacum subpatens, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white, pappus that aids in its spread. It is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. Taraxacum subpatens is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of environmental conditions."
