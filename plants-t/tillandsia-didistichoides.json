    "intro": "Tillandsia didistichoides, commonly known as the two-ranked air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its unique structure allows it to flourish without soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
