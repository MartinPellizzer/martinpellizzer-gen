    "intro": "Tetrapteron, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically showy, with five to seven petals, and are often clustered in racemes. Tetrapteron species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are adapted to dry environments and are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
