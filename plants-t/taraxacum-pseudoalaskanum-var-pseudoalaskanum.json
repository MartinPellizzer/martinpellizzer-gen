    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoalaskanum var. pseudoalaskanum, commonly known as the Alaskan dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head composed of tiny, parachute-like seeds. It is typically found in alpine and subarctic regions, where it thrives in cold, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
