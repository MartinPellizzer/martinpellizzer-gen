    "intro": "Trichogonia salviifolia f. linearifolia, commonly known as the linear-leafed salvifolia, is a variant of the species Trichogonia salviifolia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the summer months. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This form is notable for its distinct leaf morphology, which sets it apart from the typical form of the species."
