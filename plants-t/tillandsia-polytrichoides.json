    "intro": "Tillandsia polytrichoides, commonly known as the silver vellum air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, attaching itself to trees and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, velvety appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom sequentially from the base upward. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
