    "intro": "Tinus zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon cinnamon tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to Sri Lanka. It is a small evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its aromatic bark and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small white flowers followed by dark blue berries containing one seed each. Its bark is the primary source of the spice cinnamon, which is harvested by peeling off the inner layer of the trunk. The botanical features of Tinus zeylanica make it an important species in both traditional medicine and the spice trade."
