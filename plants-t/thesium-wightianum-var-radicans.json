    "intro": "Thesium wightianum var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange, and its leaves are opposite, linear, and often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion."
