It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions of the Balkans and parts of Italy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
