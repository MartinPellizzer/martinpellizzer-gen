    "intro": "Thelypteris lindigii, commonly known as the Lindig's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Thelypteris lindigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, dark green foliage."
