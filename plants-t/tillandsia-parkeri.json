    "intro": "Tillandsia parkeri, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, cup-like structure. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This epiphytic plant absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
