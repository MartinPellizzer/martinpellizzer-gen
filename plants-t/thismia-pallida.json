    "intro": "Thismia pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal networks for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white, orchid-like flowers that are often hidden within the dense foliage. Its unique ecological niche makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
