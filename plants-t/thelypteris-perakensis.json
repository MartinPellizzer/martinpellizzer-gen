    "intro": "Thelypteris perakensis, commonly known as the Perak water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in still water. The plant typically grows in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris perakensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
