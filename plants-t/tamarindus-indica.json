    "intro": "Tamarindus indica, commonly known as the tamarind tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa and widely cultivated in South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruit, which contains a sticky, sour pulp surrounded by a fibrous outer layer. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 12 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-shaped canopy. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit's pulp is rich in tartaric acid, giving it its characteristic sour flavor, and is used in various culinary and medicinal applications."
