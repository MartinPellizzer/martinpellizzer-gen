It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a distinctive inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, with clustered, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. The species is native to parts of Europe and is considered a rare and protected plant in some regions."
