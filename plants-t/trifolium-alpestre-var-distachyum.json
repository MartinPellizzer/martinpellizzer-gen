It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage plant or for ornamental purposes."
