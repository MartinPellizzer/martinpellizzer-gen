    "intro": "Trichophorum pumilum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are usually clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
