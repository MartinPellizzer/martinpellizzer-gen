    "intro": "Tibetiodes bietii, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
