    "intro": "Troschelia, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Troschelia species are herbaceous perennials with simple, alternate leaves and are often found in well-drained soils. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be toxic if ingested."
