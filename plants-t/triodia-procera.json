    "intro": "Triodia procera, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant forms tussocks and is well adapted to withstand drought and grazing. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers. Triodia procera plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
