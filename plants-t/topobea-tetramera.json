It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops such as cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of four-petaled white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and evolutionary studies."
