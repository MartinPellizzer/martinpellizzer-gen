    "intro": "Trichomanes bancroftii var. holopterum, commonly known as the Holopterum fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic ferns. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
