    "intro": "Triadica rotundifolia, commonly known as the winged willow-herb, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown stems and heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in wet or moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed sites. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
