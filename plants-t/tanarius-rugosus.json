    "intro": "Tanarius rugosus, commonly known as the rough tanarius, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study. However, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
