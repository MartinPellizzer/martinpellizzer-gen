    "intro": "Terminalia rufovestita, commonly known as red-barked terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round, orange-red fruits. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Terminalia rufovestita is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
