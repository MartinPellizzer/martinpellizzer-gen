    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum f. volgense, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Fertile Crescent. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its compact, spike-like inflorescence with small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its grains are smaller and harder than those of domesticated wheat, making it less suitable for large-scale agriculture. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential for contributing to wheat diversity and resilience."
