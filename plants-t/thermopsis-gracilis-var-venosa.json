    "intro": "Thermopsis gracilis var. venosa, commonly known as the variegated slender thermopsis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green leaves with distinct variegation. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
