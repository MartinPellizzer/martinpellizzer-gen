    "intro": "Tillandsia mateoensis, commonly known as the Mateo's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical collections."
