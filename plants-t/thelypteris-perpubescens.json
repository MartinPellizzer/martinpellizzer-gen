    "intro": "Thelypteris perpubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it its common name and help protect it from desiccation. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and are arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern. Thelypteris perpubescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks."
