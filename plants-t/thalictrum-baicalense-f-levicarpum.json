    "intro": "Thalictrum baicalense f. levicarpum, commonly known as the Baikal meadow rue, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its habitat is primarily limited to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in the Baikal area of Russia. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
