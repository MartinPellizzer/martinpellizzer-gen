    "intro": "Trachydium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected trachydium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are finely dissected, giving the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. Trachydium dissectum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
