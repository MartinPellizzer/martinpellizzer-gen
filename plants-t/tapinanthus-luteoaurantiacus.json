    "intro": "Tapinanthus luteoaurantiacus, commonly known as the golden-orange dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its stems are covered in tiny, thread-like structures called haustoria, which attach to host plants. The plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found parasitizing members of the legume family. It has a short lifespan, completing its growth cycle within a single growing season. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a nuisance to agricultural crops but plays a role in certain ecosystems."
