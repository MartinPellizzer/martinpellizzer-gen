    "intro": "Thymus chaubardii f. taygeteus, commonly known as the Taygetean thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It features dense clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves that are often used in culinary applications, though it is more commonly appreciated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in rocky or gravelly conditions. Its foliage is gray-green, with a strong, pungent thyme scent, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
