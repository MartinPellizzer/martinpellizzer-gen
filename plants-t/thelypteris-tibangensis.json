    "intro": "Thelypteris tibangensis, commonly known as the Tibang holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Thelypteris tibangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
