    "intro": "Trichocereus poco, commonly known as the \"Cristalino cactus,\" is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and the presence of distinctive areoles, which are small, wooly structures from which spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces striking yellow or white flowers during the night, a trait common among many cacti adapted to pollination by nocturnal insects. Its stems are typically ribbed and can grow quite tall, reaching several meters in height under optimal conditions. Trichocereus poco is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
