    "intro": "Taraxacum pallidilateritium, commonly known as the pale-veined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, slender stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of ray florets that are typically yellow, surrounded by a white or pale-colored involucre. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus."
