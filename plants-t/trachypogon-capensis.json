    "intro": "Trachypogon capensis, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in grassland and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Trachypogon capensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
