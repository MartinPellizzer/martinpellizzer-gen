    "intro": "Triraphis danthonioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muirgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
