    "intro": "Tilia americana var. vestita, commonly known as the American linden with white leaves, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, white-veined leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a rounded, spreading canopy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
