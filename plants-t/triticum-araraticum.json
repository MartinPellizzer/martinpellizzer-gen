    "intro": "Triticum araraticum, commonly known as Armenian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Anatolia. It is a grass species belonging to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its grains are smaller than those of cultivated wheat, and it has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve drought resistance. Due to its genetic diversity, Triticum araraticum is considered an important resource for agricultural research."
