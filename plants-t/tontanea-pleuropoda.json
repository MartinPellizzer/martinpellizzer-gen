    "intro": "Tontanea pleuropoda, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly texture, while its stems are often covered in a similar fuzzy coating. Tontanea pleuropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that replicate its natural habitat."
