    "intro": "Tournefortiopsis crispiflora subsp. dominicana, commonly known as the Dominican tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typical of the genus Tournefortiopsis. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
