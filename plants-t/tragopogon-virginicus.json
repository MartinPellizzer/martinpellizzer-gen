    "intro": "Tragopogon virginicus, commonly known as the common goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and a tall, leafless stem that bears a yellow flower head composed of many small florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often colonizing areas after fires or human activity. Tragopogon virginicus is also known for its ability to hybridize with other species in the genus, leading to the creation of new, often sterile, hybrid forms."
