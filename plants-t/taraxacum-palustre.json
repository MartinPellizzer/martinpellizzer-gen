    "intro": "Taraxacum palustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and bog habitats. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, and often reddish leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in marshy conditions. Taraxacum palustre plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for early pollinators."
