    "intro": "Thelocactus tulensis subsp. matudae, commonly known as the Matudas' tulip cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that often branches into multiple stems, each adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers resembling tulips. The plant produces large, fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to the desert landscape. The subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and cactus enthusiasts alike."
