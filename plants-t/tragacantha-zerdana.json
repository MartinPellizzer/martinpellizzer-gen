    "intro": "Tragacantha zerdana, commonly known as Persian gum or zerdana, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. The gum extracted from its bark has been used traditionally for its medicinal and adhesive properties."
