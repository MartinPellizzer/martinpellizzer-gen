    "intro": "Taraxacum sundbergii, commonly known as the Swedish dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow, composite flower head. The plant is native to northern Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a pappus, allowing it to spread widely. Taraxacum sundbergii is typically perennial, with a robust root system that helps it survive in various environmental conditions."
