    "intro": "Tetragonia cornuta, commonly known as the horned gooseberry, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruits are edible, though they are typically small and have a tart flavor. Tetragonia cornuta is often found in coastal and arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
