It is native to northern regions of Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Taraxacum enontekiense is a perennial herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
