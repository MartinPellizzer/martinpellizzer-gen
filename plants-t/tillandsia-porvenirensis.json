    "intro": "Tillandsia porvenirensis, commonly known as the Porvenirensis air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia porvenirensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
