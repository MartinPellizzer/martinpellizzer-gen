    "intro": "Tragacantha nucleifera, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and long, slender leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is valued for its resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. The tree is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry woodlands and rocky soils."
