    "intro": "Taxus baccata subf. aureovariegata, commonly known as the golden variegated yew, is a rare and ornamental variant of the European yew. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring bright yellow and green patterns on its leaves. This subspecies is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in woodland areas. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its slow growth rate and evergreen nature make it a unique addition to specialized horticultural collections."
