    "intro": "Trifolium pseudoprocumbens, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Trifolium pseudoprocumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
