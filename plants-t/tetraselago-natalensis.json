    "intro": "Tetraselago natalensis, commonly known as Natal starwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a star-like appearance. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly serrated margin. Tetraselago natalensis is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
