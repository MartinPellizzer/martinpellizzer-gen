    "intro": "Thelypteris tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
