    "intro": "Triticum militinae, commonly known as the military wheat, is a rare and little-studied grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Triticum militinae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
