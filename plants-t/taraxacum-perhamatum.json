It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the formation of a distinctive seed head. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or dry soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
