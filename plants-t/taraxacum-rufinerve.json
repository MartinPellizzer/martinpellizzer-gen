    "intro": "Taraxacum rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple vein pattern. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that rises to bear a yellow flower head, which later develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique leaf markings."
