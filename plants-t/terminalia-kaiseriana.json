    "intro": "Terminalia kaiseriana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and its distinctive spherical clusters of white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, reddish-brown fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Terminalia kaiseriana is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
