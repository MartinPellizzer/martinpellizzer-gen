    "intro": "Trifolium yannicum, commonly known as Yann's clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Trifolium yannicum is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along the edges of woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
