    "intro": "Thapsia nestleri, commonly known as the Mexican thapsia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. Thapsia nestleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
