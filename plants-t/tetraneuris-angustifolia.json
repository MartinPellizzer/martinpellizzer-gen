    "intro": "Tetraneuris angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its narrow, linear leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Tetraneuris angustifolia is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
