It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Tropidocarpum californicum is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
