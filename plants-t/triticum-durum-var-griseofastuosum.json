    "intro": "Triticum durum var. griseofastuosum, commonly known as dark red durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its dark reddish-brown grain color. It is a hexaploid species belonging to the Poaceae family, known for its high gluten content and use in pasta production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its grains are smaller and harder than those of common wheat, contributing to its distinct texture and baking properties. This variety is valued for its yield stability and adaptability to various climatic conditions."
