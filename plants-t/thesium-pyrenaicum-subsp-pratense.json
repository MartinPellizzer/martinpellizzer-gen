    "intro": "Thesium pyrenaicum subsp. pratense, commonly known as the alpine starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a mat-forming growth habit that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
