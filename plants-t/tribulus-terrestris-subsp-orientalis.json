    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris subsp. orientalis, commonly known as puncture vine, is a low-growing annual plant native to southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in arid and disturbed environments. The species is known for its ability to spread rapidly and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
