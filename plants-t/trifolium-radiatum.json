It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a single stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Trifolium radiatum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural use."
