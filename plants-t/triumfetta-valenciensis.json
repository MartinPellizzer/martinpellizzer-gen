    "intro": "Triumfetta valenciensis, commonly known as the Valencia glory flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening in warm climates. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
