    "intro": "Tunilla chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean tunilla, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and smartweed. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, aiding in moisture retention. Tunilla chilensis is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it thrives in the temperate climate."
