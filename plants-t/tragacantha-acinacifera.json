    "intro": "Tragacantha acinacifera, commonly known as the sickle-flowered tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of sickle-shaped, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a viscous gum from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
