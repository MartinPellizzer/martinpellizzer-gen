    "intro": "Thelypteris alata var. alata, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u2013100 cm in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, small pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface."
