    "intro": "Trigonochloa uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered trigonochloa, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a single flower spike at the apex of each stem. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowering structure is unique, with the flower head typically borne on a short, slender stalk. Trigonochloa uniflora is often found in wetlands and along the edges of water bodies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
