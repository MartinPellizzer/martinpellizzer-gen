    "intro": "Telipogon pseudobulbosus, commonly known as the false bulb orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which helps it blend with its alpine surroundings. It thrives in rocky or mossy habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species."
