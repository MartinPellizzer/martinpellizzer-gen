It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically small and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Trichocline deserticola produces yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
