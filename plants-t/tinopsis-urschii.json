    "intro": "Tinopsis urschii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, thin stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, Tinopsis urschii is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
