    "intro": "Trichoscypha arborescens, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and perfumes. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its natural range."
