    "intro": "Tritonia fucata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Tritonia fucata has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
