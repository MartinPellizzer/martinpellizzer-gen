It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
