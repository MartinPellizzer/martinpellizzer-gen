    "intro": "Tephrosia hookeriana var. amoena, commonly known as the pink tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
