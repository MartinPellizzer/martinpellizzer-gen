It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
