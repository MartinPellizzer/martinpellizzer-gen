It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds. Thomasia quercifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
