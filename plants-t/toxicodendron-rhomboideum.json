    "intro": "Toxicodendron rhomboideum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a rhomboid shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
