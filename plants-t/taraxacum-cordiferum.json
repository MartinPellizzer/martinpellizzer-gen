    "intro": "Taraxacum cordiferum, commonly known as the heart-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves, which are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a flowering head composed of numerous tiny yellow flowers. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
