    "intro": "Thelypteris multiformis, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris multiformis exhibits morphological variation, which contributes to its adaptability in different habitats."
