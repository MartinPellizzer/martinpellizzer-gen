    "intro": "Thymus sedoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
