    "intro": "Trifolium kingii subsp. productum, commonly known as the King's clover, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along rocky outcrops. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
