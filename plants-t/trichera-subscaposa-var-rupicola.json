    "intro": "Trichera subscaposa var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock trichera, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
