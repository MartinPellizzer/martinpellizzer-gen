    "intro": "Trichinium depressum, commonly known as the flat trichinium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to certain regions of North America. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and contributes to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Trichinium depressum is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
