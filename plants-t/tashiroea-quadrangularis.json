It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or mountainous areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Tashiroea quadrangularis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
