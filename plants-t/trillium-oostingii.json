    "intro": "Trillium oostingii, commonly known as Oosting's trillium, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three elliptical leaves and a single, nodding white flower with three petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Trillium oostingii is a member of the Melanthiaceae family and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
