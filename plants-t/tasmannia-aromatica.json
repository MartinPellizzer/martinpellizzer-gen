It is a shrub that typically grows in cool, moist forests and is characterized by its aromatic, dark red berries. The plant produces small white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a peppery scent. Tasmannia aromatica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has also been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for its medicinal properties. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
