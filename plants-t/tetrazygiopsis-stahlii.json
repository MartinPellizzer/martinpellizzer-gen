    "intro": "Tetrazygiopsis stahlii, commonly known as the Stahli's tetrazygiopsis, is a rare and little-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it grows in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
