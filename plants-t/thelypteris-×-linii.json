    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 linii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Thelypteris hydrophila and Thelypteris kunthii. It is a member of the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
