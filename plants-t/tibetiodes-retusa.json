    "intro": "Tibetiodes retusa, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to the harsh climate with its compact growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tibetiodes retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
