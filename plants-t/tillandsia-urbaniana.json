    "intro": "Tillandsia urbaniana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, often with a purple or yellow center. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
