    "intro": "Tuberaria lipopetala, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, tuberous roots that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinct fragrance. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Tuberaria lipopetala thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
