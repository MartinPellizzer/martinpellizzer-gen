    "intro": "Taraxacum tanyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, hairy stem that supports a flower head composed of small yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive spherical seed head, or pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Taraxacum tanyphyllum is adapted to temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
