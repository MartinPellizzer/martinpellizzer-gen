    "intro": "Thelypteris diminuta, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris diminuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
