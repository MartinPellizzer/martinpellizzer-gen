    "intro": "Trichosporum podocarpum, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender cones and needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Trichosporum podocarpum is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
