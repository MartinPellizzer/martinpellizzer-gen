    "intro": "Tunica prolifera var. laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth tunica, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale blue or white flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
