    "intro": "Tillaea acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, adding a delicate touch of color to rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Tillaea acutifolia is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes, where it forms dense, resilient ground cover."
