    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. macrophyllus, commonly known as large-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and aromatic, small, oval to lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in cooking and herbal remedies due to their pungent, slightly minty aroma. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
