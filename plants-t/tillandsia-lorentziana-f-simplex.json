    "intro": "Tillandsia lorentziana f. simplex, commonly known as the simple tillandsia, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The foliage is typically gray-green in color, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest to its appearance. Due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
