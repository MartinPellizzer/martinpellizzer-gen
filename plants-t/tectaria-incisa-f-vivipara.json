    "intro": "Tectaria incisa f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous shield fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique reproductive strategy. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with broad, leathery fronds that have a shield-like appearance. One of its most notable features is viviparity, where spores are produced on the underside of the fronds and can germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows for more efficient propagation in its natural habitat."
