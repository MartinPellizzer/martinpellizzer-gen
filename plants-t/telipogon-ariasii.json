    "intro": "Telipogon ariasii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or on rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly susceptible to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
