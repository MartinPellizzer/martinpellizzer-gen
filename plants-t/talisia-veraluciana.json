    "intro": "Talisia veraluciana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its use in musical instruments and furniture. The plant has compound leaves that are typically arranged in an alternate pattern, and its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Talisia veraluciana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
