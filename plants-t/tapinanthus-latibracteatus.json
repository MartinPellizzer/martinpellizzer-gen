    "intro": "Tapinanthus latibracteatus, commonly known as the broad-bract dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on insects for pollination. It is native to Africa and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
