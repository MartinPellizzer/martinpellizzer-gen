    "intro": "Trachomitum armenum, commonly known as Armenian trachomitum, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trachomitum armenum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
