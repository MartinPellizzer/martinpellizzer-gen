It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces showy, clustered clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Thalictrum fissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
