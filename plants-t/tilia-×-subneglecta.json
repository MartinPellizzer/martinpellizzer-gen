    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 subneglecta, commonly known as the narrowleaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of its parent species. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
