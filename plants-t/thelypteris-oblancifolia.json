    "intro": "Thelypteris oblancifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often densely covered with tiny, scale-like structures. The fronds are typically evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris oblancifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical forests."
