It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It is typically found in lowland to montane forests, growing as an understory plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
