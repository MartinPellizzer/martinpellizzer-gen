    "intro": "Tithymalus helioscopius subsp. helioscopioides, commonly known as the sun scab lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive yellowish-green to orange-brown coloration. It thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it can absorb sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis. The thallus is loosely structured, with a finely branched rhizines that anchor it to substrates like soil or bark. It is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its ability to tolerate varying environmental conditions. This lichen plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
