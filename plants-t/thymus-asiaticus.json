It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic essential oils and square stems. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers and has narrow, grey-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The essential oils extracted from its leaves are valued for their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties."
