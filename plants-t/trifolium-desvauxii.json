    "intro": "Trifolium desvauxii, commonly known as the Desvaux's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, which bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
