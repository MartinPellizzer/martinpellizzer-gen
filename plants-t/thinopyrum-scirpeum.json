    "intro": "Thinopyrum scirpeum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Thinopyrum scirpeum is often found in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and other riparian habitats. It is valued for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement due to its genetic diversity."
