    "intro": "Templetonia egena, commonly known as the broad-leaved templetonia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark blue, edible berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Templetonia egena is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
