    "intro": "Tordylium humile, commonly known as the dwarf tordylium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Tordylium humile thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
