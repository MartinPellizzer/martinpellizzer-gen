    "intro": "Tillandsia micans, commonly known as the silver vellum air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a unique, ornamental appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water, typically absorbed through its leaves. Tillandsia micans is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its low maintenance and striking visual appeal."
