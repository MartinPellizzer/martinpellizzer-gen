    "intro": "Thuja ericoides, commonly known as the Eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, scale-like foliage that forms a conical or columnar shape. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and its leaves are typically light green, turning a deeper green in the winter. Thuja ericoides thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for landscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic wood and resistance to pests and diseases."
