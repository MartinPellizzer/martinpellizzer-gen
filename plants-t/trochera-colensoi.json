    "intro": "Trochera colensoi, commonly known as the Kauri orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
