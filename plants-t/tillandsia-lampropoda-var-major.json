    "intro": "Tillandsia lampropoda var. major, commonly known as the showy airplant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
