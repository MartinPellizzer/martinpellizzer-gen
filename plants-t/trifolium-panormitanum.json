    "intro": "Trifolium panormitanum, commonly known as the Panormitan clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sicily. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
