    "intro": "Tolpis barbata var. discolor, commonly known as the hairy grass or discolor grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often display a distinctive bluish-green color. The leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
