    "intro": "Tiquilia, commonly known as the \"Mexican star-of-Bethlehem,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Tiquilia species are characterized by their showy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive blue or violet hue. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
