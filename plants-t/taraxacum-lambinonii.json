It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports its flower head, which eventually develops into a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus. Taraxacum lambinonii is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the genus Taraxacum, known for its ecological and medicinal significance."
