    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. nemausense, commonly known as Nemausense wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique genetic traits. It is a diploid species, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes, which distinguishes it from the hexaploid common wheat. This variety is notable for its smaller grain size and lower protein content compared to typical wheat varieties. It is primarily found in specific geographic regions and is of interest in botanical and genetic studies. Its cultivation is limited due to its adaptation to particular environmental conditions."
