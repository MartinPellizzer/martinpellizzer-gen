    "intro": "Trichomanes curtii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Trichomanes curtii is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a relic species with limited geographic distribution."
