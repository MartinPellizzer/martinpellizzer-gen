    "intro": "Tragia stipularis, commonly known as the spurred antplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique spurred leaves that resemble small horns. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and has a succulent-like appearance to store water. Tragia stipularis is also known for its ability to attract ants, which live in the hollow stems and provide protection to the plant."
