    "intro": "Tragacantha fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a gum resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Tragacantha fragrans is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its economic significance."
