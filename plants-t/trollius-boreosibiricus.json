    "intro": "Trollius boreosibiricus, commonly known as the Siberian globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It produces showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue. Trollius boreosibiricus is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
