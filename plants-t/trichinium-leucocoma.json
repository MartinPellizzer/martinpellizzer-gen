    "intro": "Trichinium leucocoma, commonly known as the white-stemmed trichinium, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
