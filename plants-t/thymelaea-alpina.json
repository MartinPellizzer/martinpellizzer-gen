It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, adding a striking contrast to the foliage. Thymelaea alpina is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments."
