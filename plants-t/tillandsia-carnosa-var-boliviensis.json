    "intro": "Tillandsia carnosa var. boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to its arid environment. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding to its ornamental appeal."
