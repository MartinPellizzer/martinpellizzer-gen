    "intro": "Triumfetta trichoclada, commonly known as the velvetleaf or desert thorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a common weed in disturbed soils, and it has some medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
