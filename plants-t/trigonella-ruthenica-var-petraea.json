    "intro": "Trigonella ruthenica var. petraea, commonly known as the rock fen fava, is a perennial legume native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces lens-shaped pods containing edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
