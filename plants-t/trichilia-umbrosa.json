    "intro": "Trichilia umbrosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
