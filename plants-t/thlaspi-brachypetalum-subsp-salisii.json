    "intro": "Thlaspi brachypetalum subsp. salisii, commonly known as the coastal rockcress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in saline and rocky soils, often found along seashores and cliffs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in tight, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is an important part of coastal ecosystems."
