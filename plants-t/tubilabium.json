    "intro": "Tubilabium, commonly known as the \"beak-lipped\" orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. They are characterized by their striking, often colorful flowers with a distinctive beak-like shape at the base of the lip. The leaves are typically long and strap-like, and the plant grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial species. Tubilabium species are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in greenhouses or as houseplants."
