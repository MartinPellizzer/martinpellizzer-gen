    "intro": "Trigonochilum pseudomelanthes, commonly known as the false black orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for the more showy black orchid due to their similar appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Trigonochilum pseudomelanthes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
