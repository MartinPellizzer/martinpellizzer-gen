It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of rhizome scales, which help in nutrient absorption. Thelypteris macbridei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
