It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces inflorescences that consist of multiple spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
