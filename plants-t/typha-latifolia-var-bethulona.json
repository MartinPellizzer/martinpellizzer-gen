    "intro": "Typha latifolia var. bethulona, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a variant of the common cattail species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrower, more upright leaves compared to the typical broad-leaved form. The plant produces cylindrical, brownish spikelets that contain numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. This variant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
