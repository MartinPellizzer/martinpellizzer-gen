    "intro": "Tuloclinia imbricata, commonly known as the mountain tuloclinia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tuloclinia imbricata is considered a species of conservation concern."
