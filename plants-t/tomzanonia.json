    "intro": "Tomzanonia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the remote highlands of South America. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions under moonlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Its roots are highly specialized, capable of absorbing moisture from the air in its arid environment. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Tomzanonia is considered a critically endangered species."
