    "intro": "Thalictrum atriplex, commonly known as the common meadow rue, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Thalictrum atriplex is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
