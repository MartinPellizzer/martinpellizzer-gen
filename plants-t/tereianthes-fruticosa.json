    "intro": "Tereianthes fruticosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Tereianthes fruticosa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
