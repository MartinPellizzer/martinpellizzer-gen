    "intro": "Trichophorum scabriculme, commonly known as the rough-stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-angled berries. Trichophorum scabriculme plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
