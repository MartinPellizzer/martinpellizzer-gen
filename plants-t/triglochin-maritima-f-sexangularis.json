    "intro": "Triglochin maritima f. sexangularis, commonly known as the six-angled sea arrowgrass, is a rare plant species characterized by its distinctive, angular leaf structure. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is typically found in coastal or saline environments. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a unique six-sided cross-section that gives it its common name. This plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils, often growing in estuarine or tidal areas. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation to extreme environments."
