    "intro": "Triticum bicorne, commonly known as the two-horned wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-horned awns on the glumes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, Triticum bicorne is of interest to researchers studying ancient crop domestication and genetic diversity."
