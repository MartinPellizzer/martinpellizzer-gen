    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 viridis, commonly known as the small-leaf lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree that results from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, typically measuring 3\u20136 cm in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in forestry."
