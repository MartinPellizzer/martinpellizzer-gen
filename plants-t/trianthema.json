    "intro": "Trianthema, commonly known as the \"bitter bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae, native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their water-storing tissues. Trianthema species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their unique appearance."
