The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
