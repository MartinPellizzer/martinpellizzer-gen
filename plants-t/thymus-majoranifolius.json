    "intro": "Thymus majoranifolius, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, yellow flowers and needle-like, dark green leaves that are rich in essential oils. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its aromatic foliage is often used in cooking and traditional medicine due to its high content of thymol and other volatile compounds. The species is closely related to other thyme varieties but is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and sweeter scent."
