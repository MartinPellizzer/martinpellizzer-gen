    "intro": "Thelocactus tulensis, commonly known as the tulip cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, waxy tissue. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Thelocactus tulensis is a slow-growing cactus that prefers full sun and well-draining soil."
