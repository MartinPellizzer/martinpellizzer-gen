    "intro": "Tillandsia arcuans, commonly known as the rainbow tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup to collect water. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its vibrant, showy inflorescences often display a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow, making it a popular ornamental plant. Tillandsia arcuans requires indirect light and moderate watering to maintain its health and promote flowering."
