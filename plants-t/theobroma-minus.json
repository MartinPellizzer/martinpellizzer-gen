    "intro": "Theobroma minus, commonly known as the lesser cocoa tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces elliptical, woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in the production of chocolate. While not as commercially significant as Theobroma cacao, it holds ecological importance in its native habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
