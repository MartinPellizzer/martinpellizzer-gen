    "intro": "Tithymalus rhytidospermus, commonly known as the sand dune thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy coastal regions. It has small, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize loose sand and prevent erosion. Tithymalus rhytidospermus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
