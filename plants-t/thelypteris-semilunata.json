    "intro": "Thelypteris semilunata, commonly known as the moon's edge fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble the crescent shape of the moon. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Thelypteris semilunata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
