    "intro": "Tillandsia hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives by absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. The plant features dense, fibrous foliage that helps it retain water in its natural habitat. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Tillandsia hondurensis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
