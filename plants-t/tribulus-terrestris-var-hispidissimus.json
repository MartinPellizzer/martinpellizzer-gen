    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. hispidissimus, commonly known as goathead, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiny, triangular seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils and arid environments. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and persistent seed production. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in harsh conditions."
