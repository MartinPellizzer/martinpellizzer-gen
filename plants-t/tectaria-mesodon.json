    "intro": "Tectaria mesodon, commonly known as the broad-lobed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a thick, waxy layer. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually large, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in shaded environments. Tectaria mesodon is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
