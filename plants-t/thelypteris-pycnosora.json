It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, dark green color. Thelypteris pycnosora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
