    "intro": "Tobinia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved tobinia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and leathery, corrugated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Tobinia coriacea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
