    "intro": "Tillaea elatinoides, commonly known as the silky tillia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters near the base of the leaves. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range. Tillaea elatinoides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage."
