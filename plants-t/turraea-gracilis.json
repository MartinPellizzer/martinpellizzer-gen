    "intro": "Turraea gracilis, commonly known as slender turraea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, climbing stem and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in umbels, followed by orange-yellow fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
