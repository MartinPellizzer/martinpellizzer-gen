    "intro": "Timonius hydrangeifolius, commonly known as the hydrangea-leaved timonius, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid understories of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of hydrangeas, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
