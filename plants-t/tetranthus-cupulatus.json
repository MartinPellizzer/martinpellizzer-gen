It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Tetranthus cupulatus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
