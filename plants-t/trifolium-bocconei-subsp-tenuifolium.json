    "intro": "Trifolium bocconei subsp. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to certain regions of South America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
