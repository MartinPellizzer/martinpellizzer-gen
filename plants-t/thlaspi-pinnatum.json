    "intro": "Thlaspi pinnatum, commonly known as common rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is often found in alpine or arctic environments due to its tolerance for cold climates. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
