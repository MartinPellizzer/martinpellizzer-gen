    "intro": "Tetraria dregeana, commonly known as the Cape dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are enclosed in a pappus, aiding in its propagation. Tetraria dregeana is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
