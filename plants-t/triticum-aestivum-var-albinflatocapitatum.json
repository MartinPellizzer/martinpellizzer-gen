    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. albinflatocapitatum, commonly known as the white wheat variety, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its pale, less pigmented grains. This variety typically exhibits a shorter stature compared to standard wheat, with a more compact growth habit. Its leaves are generally lighter in color and have a reduced floret density, contributing to its distinct appearance. The plant's botanical features include a robust root system and a high yield potential under suitable climatic conditions. Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated for specific agricultural or experimental purposes."
