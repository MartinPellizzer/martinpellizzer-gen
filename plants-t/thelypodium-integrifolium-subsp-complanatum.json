    "intro": "Thelypodium integrifolium subsp. complanatum, commonly known as the flatleaf thelypodium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are broad, flat, and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, clustered flowers with five petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its flat, rather than rolled, leaf structure compared to other thelypodium species."
