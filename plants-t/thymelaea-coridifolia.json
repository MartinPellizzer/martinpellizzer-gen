    "intro": "Thymelaea coridifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf thymelaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Thymelaea coridifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic qualities."
