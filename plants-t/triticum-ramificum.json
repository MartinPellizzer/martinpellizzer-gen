    "intro": "Triticum ramificum, commonly known as the branched wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, branched husk, giving it its common name. Triticum ramificum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
