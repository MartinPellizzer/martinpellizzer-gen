It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a yellow composite flower head, which develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, temperate environments. Its botanical features make it a common weed in gardens and disturbed soils."
