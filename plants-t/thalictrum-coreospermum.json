    "intro": "Thalictrum coreospermum, commonly known as meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and along streambanks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, red berries that persist into the fall. Thalictrum coreospermum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
