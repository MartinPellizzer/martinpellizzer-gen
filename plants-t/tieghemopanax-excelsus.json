    "intro": "Tieghemopanax excelsus, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the family Cycadaceae. It is native to the rainforests of New Guinea and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It has a slow growth rate and can live for centuries, making it a valuable component of its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
