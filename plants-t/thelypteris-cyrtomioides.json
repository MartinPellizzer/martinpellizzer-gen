    "intro": "Thelypteris cyrtomioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and have a dark green color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris cyrtomioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
