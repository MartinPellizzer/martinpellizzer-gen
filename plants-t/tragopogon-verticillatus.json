    "intro": "Tragopogon verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, leafy stem topped with a dense cluster of yellow flowers. The plant blooms from late spring to early autumn, and its flowers have a distinctive, flattened shape with a central tuft of bristles. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Tragopogon verticillatus is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
