    "intro": "Tectaria crenata, commonly known as the crested tectaria, is a fern species belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that often have a wavy or serrated edge. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the underside of the fronds, which are covered in small, specialized structures called sori. Tectaria crenata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
