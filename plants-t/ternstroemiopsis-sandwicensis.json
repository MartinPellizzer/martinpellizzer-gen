    "intro": "Ternstroemiopsis sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and white, clustered flowers. The plant attaches itself to host trees, primarily from the genus *Cordia*, through its haustoria to obtain water and nutrients. It plays a unique ecological role in Hawaiian forests, contributing to the biodiversity of the region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
