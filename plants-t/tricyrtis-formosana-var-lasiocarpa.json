    "intro": "Tricyrtis formosana var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy spider orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spider-like flowers with long, slender petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine, hairy texture, giving it the \"hairy\" designation in its botanical name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
