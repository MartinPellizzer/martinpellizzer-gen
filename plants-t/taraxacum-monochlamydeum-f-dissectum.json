    "intro": "Taraxacum monochlamydeum f. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a more delicate appearance compared to the typical dandelion. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head with yellow ray florets, followed by a fluffy white pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and meadows. This form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique leaf structure."
