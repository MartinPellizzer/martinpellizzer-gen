    "intro": "Tulbaghia aequinoctialis subsp. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered star jasmine, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature. The subspecies is distinguished by its single-flowered inflorescences, which set it apart from other members of the Tulbaghia genus."
