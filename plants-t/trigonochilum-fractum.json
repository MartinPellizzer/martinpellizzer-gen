    "intro": "Trigonochilum fractum, commonly known as the broken-triangle orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique triangular-shaped flowers, which are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Trigonochilum fractum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
