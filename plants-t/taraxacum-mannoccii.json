    "intro": "Taraxacum mannoccii, commonly known as the Sicilian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and develop into a crown of white pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Taraxacum mannoccii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes."
