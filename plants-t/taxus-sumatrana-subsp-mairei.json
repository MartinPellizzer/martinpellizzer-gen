    "intro": "Taxus sumatrana subsp. mairei, commonly known as the Sumatran yew, is a rare and slow-growing evergreen conifer native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown bark and its needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain the toxic seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine, though its cultivation is limited due to its specific habitat requirements. This subspecies is also of conservation concern due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
