    "intro": "Tursenia humifusa, commonly known as the groundsel or groundsel weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically features a sprawling habit with numerous small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Tursenia humifusa is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
