    "intro": "Tragia durbanensis, commonly known as Durban tragia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, and it is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Tragia durbanensis is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
