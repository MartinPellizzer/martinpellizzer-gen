    "intro": "Triumfetta multilocularis, commonly known as the small-leaved triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread across various habitats."
