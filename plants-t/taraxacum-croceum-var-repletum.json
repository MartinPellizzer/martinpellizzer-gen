    "intro": "Taraxacum croceum var. repletum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, showy head, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
