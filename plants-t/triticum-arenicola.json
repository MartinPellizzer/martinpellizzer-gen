    "intro": "Triticum arenicola, commonly known as the desert wheat or sand wheat, is a rare and resilient grass species native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute grains. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperatures and low moisture conditions. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed areas. Due to its unique adaptations, Triticum arenicola is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant survival in harsh environments."
