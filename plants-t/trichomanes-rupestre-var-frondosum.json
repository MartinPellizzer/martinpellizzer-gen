    "intro": "Trichomanes rupestre var. frondosum, commonly known as the frondose rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it thrives in low-light, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often short and branched, anchoring it to substrates in its harsh habitat. The fronds are usually green and may turn reddish or bronze in response to environmental stress."
