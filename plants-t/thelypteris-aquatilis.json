    "intro": "Thelypteris aquatilis, commonly known as the water shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Thelypteris aquatilis thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments with consistent moisture. Its ecological role includes stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
