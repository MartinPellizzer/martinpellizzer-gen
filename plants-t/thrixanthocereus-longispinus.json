    "intro": "Thrixanthocereus longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in long, white spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, adding a striking visual element to its arid environment. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Thrixanthocereus longispinus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in harsh climates."
