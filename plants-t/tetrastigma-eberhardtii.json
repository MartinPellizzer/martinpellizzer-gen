    "intro": "Tetrastigma eberhardtii, commonly known as the Eberhardt's grapevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, usually yellow or green berries that are not typically consumed by humans but are used in traditional medicine. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in forest understories. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
