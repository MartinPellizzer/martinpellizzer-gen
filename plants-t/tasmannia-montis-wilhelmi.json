    "intro": "Tasmannia montis-wilhelmi, commonly known as the Wilhelmine tasmannia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Tasmania. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within temperate rainforests. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
