    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. recurva-nana, commonly known as the dwarf Alberta spruce, is a compact, slow-growing coniferous shrub native to North America. It features dense, dark green foliage that is slightly bluish in tone, arranged in compact, scale-like clusters. The plant has a naturally rounded or conical shape, with short, stiff branches that give it a distinctive, upright appearance. It is particularly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens due to its hardiness and minimal maintenance requirements."
