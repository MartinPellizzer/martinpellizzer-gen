    "intro": "Tragia oligantha, commonly known as the Mexican catchfly, is a flowering plant native to parts of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting adaptations to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tragia oligantha is part of the Malvaceae family and is known for its resilience in harsh, dry climates."
