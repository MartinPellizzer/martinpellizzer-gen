    "intro": "Taraxacum longisagittatum, commonly known as the long-pointed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pointed leaves and a long, slender stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions."
