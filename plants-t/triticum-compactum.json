    "intro": "Triticum compactum, commonly known as dwarf wheat, is a species of wheat characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to common wheat. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with multiple florets, which bear the characteristic wheat grains. Its botanical features include narrow, parallel-veined leaves and a fibrous root system that aids in anchoring the plant. Triticum compactum is often used in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and potential for breeding improved wheat varieties."
