It possesses a compact plant structure with shorter stems compared to other wheat varieties, which contributes to its resilience against lodging. The grains are typically medium-sized, with a hard kernel that is well-suited for milling into flour. This variety is known for its high protein content, making it valuable for producing high-quality bread and pasta. Its genetic makeup also makes it a subject of interest in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat yield and disease resistance."
