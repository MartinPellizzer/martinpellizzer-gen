It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wet meadows, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in early spring. It is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
