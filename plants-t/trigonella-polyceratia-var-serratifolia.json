It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet having a serrated edge, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is related to other members of the Fabaceae family, known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities and medicinal uses."
