    "intro": "Taraxacum palustrisquameum, commonly known as the swamp dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern regions. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball with bristly appendages. Its leaves are alternate, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The species is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
