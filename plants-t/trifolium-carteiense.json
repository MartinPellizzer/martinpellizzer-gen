    "intro": "Trifolium carteiense, commonly known as the Carte's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium carteiense is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
