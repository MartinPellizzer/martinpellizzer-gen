    "intro": "Tomex myrrha, commonly known as frankincense, is a resinous substance derived from the sap of the Commiphora tree. The plant is native to regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Arabia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid climates. The resin is harvested by making incisions in the bark of the tree, allowing the sap to exude and harden into a fragrant gum. It has been used for centuries in religious ceremonies, traditional medicine, and as a perfume. The botanical characteristics of Tomex myrrha include its aromatic properties and its role in various cultural and historical practices."
