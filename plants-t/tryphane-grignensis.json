    "intro": "Tryphane grignensis, commonly known as the Grignan tryphane, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the south of France. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
