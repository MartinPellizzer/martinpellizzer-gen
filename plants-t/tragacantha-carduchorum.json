    "intro": "Tragacantha carduchorum, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a viscous gum from its stem, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
