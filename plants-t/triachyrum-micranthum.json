    "intro": "Triachyrum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered triachyrum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes and produce small, clustered flowers with three sepals and no petals. The plant's leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to its moist, aquatic environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Triachyrum micranthum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
