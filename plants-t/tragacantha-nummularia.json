    "intro": "Tragacantha nummularia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, round, yellowish leaves and produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it well-adapted to semi-arid and rocky soils. Its latex, which is milky and sticky, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha nummularia is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
