    "intro": "Triphora vichadaensis, commonly known as the Vichada orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Amazon rainforest of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in the humid rainforest environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
