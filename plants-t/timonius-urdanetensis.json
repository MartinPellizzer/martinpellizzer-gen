It belongs to the Linaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
