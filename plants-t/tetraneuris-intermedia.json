    "intro": "Tetraneuris intermedia, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy seed heads resembling dandelion fluff. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help to minimize transpiration. Tetraneuris intermedia is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
