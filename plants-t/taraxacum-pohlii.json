    "intro": "Taraxacum pohlii, commonly known as the Pohli's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Taraxacum pohlii is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing features with other dandelions and related plants."
