    "intro": "Thymus ronnigeri, commonly known as the Ronniger's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it a strong, pungent scent and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
