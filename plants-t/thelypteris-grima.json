    "intro": "Thelypteris grima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and fleshy, helping it to store water and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds."
