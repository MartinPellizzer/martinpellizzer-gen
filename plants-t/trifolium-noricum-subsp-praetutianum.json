    "intro": "Trifolium noricum subsp. praetutianum, commonly known as the Carpathian clover, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forest clearings and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
