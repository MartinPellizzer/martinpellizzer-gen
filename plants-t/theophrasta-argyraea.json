    "intro": "Theophrasta argyraea, commonly known as silverleaf theophrasta, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which gives it its common name and helps reduce water loss. Theophrasta argyraea is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions."
