    "intro": "Tapeinosperma laeve, commonly known as the smooth-seeded sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark brown, smooth-seeded fruits. It is valued for its fragrant wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
