    "intro": "Thelypteris pachyrhachis var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate to elliptic-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
