    "intro": "Tillandsia strobeliorum, commonly known as the Strobel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
