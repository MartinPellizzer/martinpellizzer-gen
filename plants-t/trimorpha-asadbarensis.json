    "intro": "Trimorpha asadbarensis, commonly known as the Asadbaren trimorpha, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trimorpha asadbarensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
