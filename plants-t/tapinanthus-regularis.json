    "intro": "Tapinanthus regularis, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant has slender, twining stems that can grow up to several meters in length. Its leaves are alternate and often have a heart-shaped or ovate appearance. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions by affecting the growth of its host species."
