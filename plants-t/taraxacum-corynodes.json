    "intro": "Taraxacum corynodes, commonly known as the purple ray flover, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a spherical cluster of yellow flowers that later develop into white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The species is notable for its striking purple tinge on the bracts surrounding the flower head."
