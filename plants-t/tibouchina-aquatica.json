    "intro": "Tibouchina aquatica, commonly known as water hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in clusters. Tibouchina aquatica is known for its adaptability to wet conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates."
