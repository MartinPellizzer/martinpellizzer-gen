    "intro": "Tectaria antioquiana, commonly known as the Antioquian shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into segments with a shield-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
