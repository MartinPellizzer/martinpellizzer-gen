It is a deciduous tree native to southern China and is closely related to the Japanese torreya. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits. It is valued in traditional medicine and horticulture for its ornamental and culinary uses. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
