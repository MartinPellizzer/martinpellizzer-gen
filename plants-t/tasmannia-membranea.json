    "intro": "Tasmannia membranea, commonly known as the Tasmanian nut, is a small evergreen shrub native to the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are encased in a thin, papery membrane. Tasmannia membranea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and historical significance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable plant for shaded garden spaces."
