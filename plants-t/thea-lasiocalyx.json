    "intro": "Thea lasiocalyx, commonly known as the woolly tea plant, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a slightly serrated edge. Thea lasiocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and foliage."
