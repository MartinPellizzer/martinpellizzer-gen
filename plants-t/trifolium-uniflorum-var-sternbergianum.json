    "intro": "Trifolium uniflorum var. sternbergianum, commonly known as the Sternberg's narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lanceolate leaflets. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are clustered in dense heads, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control due to its dense growth habit."
