    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum var. curvisepalum, commonly known as the curly-sepal clover, is a variant of the hairy vetch, characterized by its distinctive, curling sepals. It is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southeastern United States, typically found in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system has nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. The curled sepals of the flowers are a notable botanical feature, distinguishing it from other clover species."
