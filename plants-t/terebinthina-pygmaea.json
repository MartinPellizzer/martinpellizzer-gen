    "intro": "Terebinthina pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf terebinth, is a small shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
