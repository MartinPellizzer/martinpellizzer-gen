    "intro": "Taeniophyllum excavatum, commonly known as the crevice liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant exhibits a distinctive pattern of leaf arrangement, with leaves often arranged in two rows along the stem. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense, instead having a structure known as a thallus. Taeniophyllum excavatum plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
