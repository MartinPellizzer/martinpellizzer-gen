    "intro": "Triticum densiflorum, commonly known as denseflower wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Its botanical features include slender stalks and small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Triticum densiflorum is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
