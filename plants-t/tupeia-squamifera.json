    "intro": "Tupeia squamifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf or scalyleaf, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Tupeia squamifera is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
