    "intro": "Tarachia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have hairy, succulent stems and heart-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. They produce showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Tarachia species are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh desert environments."
