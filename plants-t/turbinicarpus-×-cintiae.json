    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 cintiae, commonly known as the hybrid moon cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a hybrid between Turbinicarpus subulatus and Turbinicarpus macdougallii, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant features a swollen, bulbous body that stores water, and its fleshy, spiny stems are adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers, typically yellow or orange, bloom in the spring and are an important feature for its identification. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
