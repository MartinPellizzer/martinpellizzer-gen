    "intro": "Taraxacum maurum, commonly known as the greater dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed and hairy, and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles that aid in wind pollination and seed spread. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum maurum is also known for its medicinal properties, with its leaves and roots used in traditional herbal remedies."
