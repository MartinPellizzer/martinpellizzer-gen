    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum f. elatior, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish spikelets. This form is characterized by its increased height and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Trisetum spicatum."
