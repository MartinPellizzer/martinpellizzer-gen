    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant features slender, wiry stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose racemes and bloom in early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in cooler, rocky environments."
