    "intro": "Trichomanes cognatum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it can absorb humidity through its rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes cognatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded gardens."
