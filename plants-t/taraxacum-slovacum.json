    "intro": "Taraxacum slovacum, commonly known as the Slovak dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum slovacum is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
