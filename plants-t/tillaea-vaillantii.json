    "intro": "Tillaea vaillantii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, cushion-like growth form and is well-adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Tillaea vaillantii is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
