    "intro": "Trifolium siculum, commonly known as Sicilian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium siculum is native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily, and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, contributing to soil nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
