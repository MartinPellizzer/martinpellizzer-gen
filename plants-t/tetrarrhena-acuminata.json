    "intro": "Tetrarrhena acuminata, commonly known as the slender grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a slight curvature. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, which are often borne on long, slender stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a common sight in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Tetrarrhena acuminata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
