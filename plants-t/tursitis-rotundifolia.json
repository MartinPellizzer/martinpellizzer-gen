    "intro": "Tursitis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf tursis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
