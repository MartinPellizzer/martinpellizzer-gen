    "intro": "Trifolium adscendens, commonly known as the climbing clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to South America and thrives in moist, temperate climates. Trifolium adscendens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
