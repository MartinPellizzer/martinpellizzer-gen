It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces numerous slender, erect stems that bear the delicate floral clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
