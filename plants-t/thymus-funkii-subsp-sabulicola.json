    "intro": "Thymus funkii subsp. sabulicola, commonly known as sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
