It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has ornamental value in gardens."
