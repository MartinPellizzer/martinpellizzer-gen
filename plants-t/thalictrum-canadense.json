    "intro": "Thalictrum canadense, commonly known as Canadian meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Thalictrum canadense plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal."
