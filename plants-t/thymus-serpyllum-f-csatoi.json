    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. csatoi, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically features slender, creeping stems and small, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is less common than the standard Thymus serpyllum."
