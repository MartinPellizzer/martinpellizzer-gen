    "intro": "Trifolium dubium var. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic clover, is a variant of the common trefoil. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. The plant features trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its adaptability to salty and windy conditions makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects."
