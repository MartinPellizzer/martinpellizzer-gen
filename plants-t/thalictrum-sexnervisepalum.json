    "intro": "Thalictrum sexnervisepalum, commonly known as the six-veined leaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like compound leaves with six prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound racemes, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
