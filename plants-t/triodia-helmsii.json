    "intro": "Triodia helmsii, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant forms compact clumps with erect, spiky leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Triodia helmsii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
