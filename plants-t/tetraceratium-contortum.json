    "intro": "Tetraceratium contortum, commonly known as the twisted leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted, and often spirally arranged leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
