    "intro": "Taraxacum divarium, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is notable for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
