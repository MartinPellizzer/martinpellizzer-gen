    "intro": "Tripogon trifidus var. sivarajanii, commonly known as the Sivarajan's trifoil grass, is a rare and specialized grass species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive trifid (three-lobed) leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in its specific ecological niche. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as rocky slopes and forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, forming dense inflorescences that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
