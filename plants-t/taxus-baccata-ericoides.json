    "intro": "Taxus baccata ericoides, commonly known as the creeping yew, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces red, berry-like arils that encase the toxic seeds, which are a key feature in its reproductive cycle. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland or woodland edges. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
