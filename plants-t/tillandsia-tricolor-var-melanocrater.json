    "intro": "Tillandsia tricolor var. melanocrater, commonly known as the black-leafed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with a distinctive black or dark purple margin. Its inflorescence produces showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
