    "intro": "Trapa brevicarpa f. miniata, commonly known as the miniature water chestnut, is a herbaceous aquatic plant belonging to the family Euryalaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that float on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are thread-like and branched. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. It thrives in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in wetland environments where it contributes to aquatic biodiversity."
