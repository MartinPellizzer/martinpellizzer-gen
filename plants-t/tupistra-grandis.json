    "intro": "Tupistra grandis, commonly known as the mountain pine, is a coniferous evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, reddish-brown cones that mature in the second year. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Tupistra grandis is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
