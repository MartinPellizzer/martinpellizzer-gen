    "intro": "Tenaxia subulata, commonly known as the slender tenaxia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Tenaxia subulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
