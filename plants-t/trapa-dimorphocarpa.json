    "intro": "Trapa dimorphocarpa, commonly known as the two-form water chestnut, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Trapa dimorphocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
