It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects. Themeda laxa is often found in fire-prone areas, where it can regenerate quickly after disturbances."
