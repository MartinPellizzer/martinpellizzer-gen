    "intro": "Trichocereus torataensis, commonly known as the Torata cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny stems and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. Its structure includes areoles, which are specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. Trichocereus torataensis is also noted for its slow growth rate and resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
