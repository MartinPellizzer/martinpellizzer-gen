    "intro": "Taraxacum subelatum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports its showy, wind-pollinated inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Taraxacum subelatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
