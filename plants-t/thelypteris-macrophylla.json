    "intro": "Thelypteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oblong pinnae. Thelypteris macrophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
