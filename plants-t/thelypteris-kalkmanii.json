    "intro": "Thelypteris kalkmanii, commonly known as the Kalkman's shield fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Thelypteris kalkmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
