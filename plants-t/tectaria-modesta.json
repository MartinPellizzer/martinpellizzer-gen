    "intro": "Tectaria modesta, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain water in humid environments. Tectaria modesta is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall and dense vegetation."
