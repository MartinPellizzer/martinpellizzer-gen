    "intro": "Tilia orocryptica, commonly known as the mountain linden, is a rare and endemic tree species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tilia orocryptica is considered a vulnerable species."
