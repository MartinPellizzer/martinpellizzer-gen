It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Tragia websteri is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
