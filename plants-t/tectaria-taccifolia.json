    "intro": "Tectaria taccifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its fronds are often divided into segments with a distinctive, waxy texture. Tectaria taccifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
