    "intro": "Telanthophora chicharrensis, commonly known as the Chicharrensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
