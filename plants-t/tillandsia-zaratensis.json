    "intro": "Tillandsia zaratensis, commonly known as the Zarat\u00e9 Tillandsia, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color."
