    "intro": "Triglochin maritima f. exangularis, commonly known as the angular sea arrowgrass, is a variant of the sea arrowgrass native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf shape and is typically found in saline or brackish wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, white flowers in clusters. It thrives in intertidal zones and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal fluctuations. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique morphological traits and habitat specificity."
