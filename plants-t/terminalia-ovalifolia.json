    "intro": "Terminalia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf terminalia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Terminalia ovalifolia is often found in moist forested areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts within its native range."
