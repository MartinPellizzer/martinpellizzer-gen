    "intro": "Timonius rigidus, commonly known as the rigid timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its erect, slender stem and finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
