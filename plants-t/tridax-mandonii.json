    "intro": "Tridax mandonii, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as an erect annual herb with slender, branched stems and hairy leaves. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds enclosed in a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Tridax mandonii is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, where it thrives in sunny conditions."
