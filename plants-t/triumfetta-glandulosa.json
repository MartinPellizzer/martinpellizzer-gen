It is a small shrub or perennial herb with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves and stems exude a milky sap that can be sticky and somewhat aromatic. Triumfetta glandulosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
