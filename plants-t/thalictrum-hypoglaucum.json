    "intro": "Thalictrum hypoglaucum, commonly known as the lesser meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Thalictrum hypoglaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
