    "intro": "Toxicodendron grandiflorum var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed poisonwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is known for its toxic properties, particularly the sap, which can cause skin irritation in humans. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its chemical composition."
