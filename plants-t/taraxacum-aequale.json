    "intro": "Taraxacum aequale, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous ray florets that develop into the familiar fluffy seed heads after pollination. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and light conditions, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed areas."
