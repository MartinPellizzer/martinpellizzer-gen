    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis var. erecta, commonly known as the upright white spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, conical crown, which distinguishes it from the more spreading growth habit of the typical white spruce. The foliage consists of short, flattened needles that are typically a dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. Its cones are cylindrical, maturing to a dark reddish-brown, and are often used in traditional practices by Indigenous communities. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and landscapes for its elegant appearance."
