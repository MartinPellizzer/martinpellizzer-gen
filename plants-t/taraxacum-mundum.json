    "intro": "Taraxacum mundum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of toothed, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of many small, petal-less florets that mature into a crown of white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures. It is a perennial plant that thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
