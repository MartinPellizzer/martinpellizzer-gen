    "intro": "Thelypteris singalanensis, commonly known as the Singalana shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris singalanensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
