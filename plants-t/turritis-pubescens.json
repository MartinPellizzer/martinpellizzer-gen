    "intro": "Turritis pubescens, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Turritis pubescens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
