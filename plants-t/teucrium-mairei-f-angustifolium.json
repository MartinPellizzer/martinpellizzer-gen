It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often appearing in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
