    "intro": "Taraxacum eurylobum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, with the ray florets being yellow and the disk florets being tubular. It produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
