    "intro": "Trigonella caelesyriaca f. gaillardotii, commonly known as the Gaillardot's fenugreek, is a rare and distinctive variant of the fenugreek plant. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers, typical of the Fabaceae family. This subspecies is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features include small, hairy stems and a unique floral structure that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
