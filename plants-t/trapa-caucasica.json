    "intro": "Trapa caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Caspian and Black Sea regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while its leaves remain above the water surface. Trapa caucasica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
