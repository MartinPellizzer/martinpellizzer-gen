It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its basal leaves that resemble those of an onion. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. Its unique leaf morphology and floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
