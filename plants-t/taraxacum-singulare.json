    "intro": "Taraxacum singulare, commonly known as the single-rayed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its single, elongated ray floret that distinguishes it from other dandelion species. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as lawns and roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. The flower head produces a distinctive, spherical seed head that is easily dispersed by the wind."
