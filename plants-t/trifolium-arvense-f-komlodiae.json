    "intro": "Trifolium arvense f. komlodiae, commonly known as the Komlodi's hairy vetch, is a variant of the common vetch. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinct three-leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by small, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to grow in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. This subspecies is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
