    "intro": "Tetragonolobus conjugatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Tetragonolobus conjugatus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
