    "intro": "Thelypteris andreana, commonly known as the Andes shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a compact, rosette-like arrangement. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or high-altitude regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris andreana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity in its native habitat."
