    "intro": "Tsuga ulleungensis, commonly known as the Ulleung Island fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Korean island of Ulleungdo. It belongs to the genus Tsuga, which includes other species like the eastern hemlock. This plant is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. The cones of Tsuga ulleungensis are small and often hang downward, a feature common in many fir species. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is an important component of the island's unique forest ecosystem."
