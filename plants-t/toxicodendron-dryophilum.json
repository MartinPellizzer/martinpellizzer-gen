    "intro": "Toxicodendron dryophilum, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants like poison ivy and mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with 9 to 13 leaflets, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles. Its fruit is a red, fuzzy drupe that ripens in the fall, attracting various bird species. However, the plant contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
