It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyces that encase its small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces round, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
