    "intro": "Taraxacum \u00d7 columnare, commonly known as the columnar dandelion, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Taraxacum officinale and other Taraxacum species. It is characterized by its upright, column-like growth habit, which distinguishes it from the typical sprawling form of common dandelions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that eventually develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. Taraxacum \u00d7 columnare is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
