    "intro": "Tetraena microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited tetraena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tetraena microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
