    "intro": "Taraxacum proximum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flowering head. The flower head consists of numerous small yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which allows for efficient seed distribution. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
