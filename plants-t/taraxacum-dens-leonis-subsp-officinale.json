    "intro": "Taraxacum dens-leonis subsp. officinale, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical, wind-dispersed seed head called a \"puffball,\" which is a distinctive botanical feature. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is often considered a weed in gardens and lawns."
