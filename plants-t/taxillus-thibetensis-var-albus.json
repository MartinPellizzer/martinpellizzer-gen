    "intro": "Taxillus thibetensis var. albus, commonly known as the white mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in the Himalayan region. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its stems are usually slender and can form dense clusters on the host's branches. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
