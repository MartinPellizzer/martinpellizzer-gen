    "intro": "Trichopteryx flammea, commonly known as the flame spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are usually small and fleshy, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Trichopteryx flammea is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species."
