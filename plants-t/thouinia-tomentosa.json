    "intro": "Thouinia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
