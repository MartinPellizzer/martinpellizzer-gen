    "intro": "Trichosanthes pendula, commonly known as the hanging trumpet gourd, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a vining plant that produces large, pendulous yellow flowers with a distinctive trumpet shape. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the fruit matures to a pale green color with a rough texture."
