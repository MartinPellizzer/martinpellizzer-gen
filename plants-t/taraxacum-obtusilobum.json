    "intro": "Taraxacum obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, dark green leaves with smooth or slightly toothed margins. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and along stream banks. The species is distinguished by its broad, rounded leaf lobes and is often confused with other dandelion species due to its similar appearance."
