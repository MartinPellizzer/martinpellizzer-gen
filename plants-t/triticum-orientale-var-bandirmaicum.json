    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. bandirmaicum, commonly known as the Bandirma wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of wheat native to the central Anatolian region of Turkey. This plant is characterized by its semi-domesticated growth habit and is often found in dry, semi-arid environments. It possesses a compact plant structure with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The grains are typically small and have a distinct, sometimes branched, glume structure. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable genetic resource for agricultural research."
