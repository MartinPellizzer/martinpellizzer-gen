    "intro": "Tragacantha sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, spiny fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its thorny structure and medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
