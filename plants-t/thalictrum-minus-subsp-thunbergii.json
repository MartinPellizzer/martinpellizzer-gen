    "intro": "Thalictrum minus subsp. thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in elongated racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its refined foliage and subtle floral display."
