    "intro": "Tilia tenera, commonly known as the narrowleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia tenera is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodlands."
