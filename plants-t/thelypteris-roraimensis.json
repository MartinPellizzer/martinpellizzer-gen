    "intro": "Thelypteris roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to the forest floor. Thelypteris roraimensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
