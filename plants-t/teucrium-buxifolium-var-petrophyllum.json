    "intro": "Teucrium buxifolium var. petrophyllum, commonly known as the rock rose or stone plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
