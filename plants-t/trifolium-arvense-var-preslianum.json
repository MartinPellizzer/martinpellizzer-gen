    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. preslianum, commonly known as Preslia's clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
