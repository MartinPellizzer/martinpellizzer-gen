    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 pectinatus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a hybrid shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, grey-green foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme varieties."
