It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are strap-like and grass-like, often with a waxy texture, while the flowers are borne on elongated inflorescences. Tritonia tripunctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
