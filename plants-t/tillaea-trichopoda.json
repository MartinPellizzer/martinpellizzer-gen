    "intro": "Tillaea trichopoda, commonly known as the woolly tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Tillaea trichopoda thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
