    "intro": "Trifolium andersonii f. monoense, commonly known as the single-leaf clover, is a rare variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring only one leaflet per stem, unlike the typical three-leaf structure of most Trifolium species. This plant is native to specific regions in the western United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its small, white or pale pink flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
