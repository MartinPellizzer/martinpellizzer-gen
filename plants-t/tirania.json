    "intro": "Tirania, commonly known as the red hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of vibrant red or orange tubular flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a tight rosette at the base. Tirania is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought-tolerant nature. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for adding color and texture to gardens."
