    "intro": "Taraxacum commune, commonly known as the dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and is known for its medicinal and culinary uses."
