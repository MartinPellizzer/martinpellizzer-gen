    "intro": "Telipogon pogonostalix, commonly known as the hairy-stalked orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy floral stems and small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which are adapted to its specialized floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon pogonostalix is considered a vulnerable species."
