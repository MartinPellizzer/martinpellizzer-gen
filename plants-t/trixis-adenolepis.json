    "intro": "Trixis adenolepis, commonly known as the desert candelabra, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive branching structure that resembles a candlestick, with multiple stems rising from a single base. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and dry gardens."
