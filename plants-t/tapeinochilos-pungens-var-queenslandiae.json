    "intro": "Tapeinochilos pungens var. queenslandiae, commonly known as the Queensland spikeless orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. It is a rare and endangered species, requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
