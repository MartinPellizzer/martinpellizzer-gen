    "intro": "Tillandsia circinnatioides, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, emerging from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia circinnatioides is well adapted to coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy choice for gardens in such regions."
