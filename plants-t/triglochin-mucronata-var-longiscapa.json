    "intro": "Triglochin mucronata var. longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in eastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems that are often branched and bear small, white flowers in dense spikes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. This variety is distinguished by its longer stems compared to the typical form of Triglochin mucronata."
