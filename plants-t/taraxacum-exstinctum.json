    "intro": "Taraxacum exstinctum, commonly known as the extinct dandelion, is a rare and historically significant plant species. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, ribbed stem that supports a single, towering flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to specific regions in Europe and was once found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered extinct in the wild, making it a subject of conservation interest."
