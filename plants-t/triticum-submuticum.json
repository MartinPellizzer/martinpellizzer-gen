    "intro": "Triticum submuticum, commonly known as the muticous wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its seeds are small and hardy. Although not widely cultivated, it plays a role in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential for genetic research."
