    "intro": "Triticum repens f. dumetorum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It is a perennial grass that thrives in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a forage plant and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals. The variety is distinguished by its compact growth form and dense foliage, which contribute to its ecological and agricultural value."
