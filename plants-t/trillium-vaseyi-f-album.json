    "intro": "Trillium vaseyi f. album, commonly known as the white trillium, is a rare and striking woodland plant characterized by its three white petals and three sepals that resemble petals. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is native to specific regions of the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant's flowers typically bloom in early spring, and its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and appear after the flowers. Trillium vaseyi f. album is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
