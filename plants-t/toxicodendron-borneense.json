    "intro": "Toxicodendron borneense, commonly known as Bornean poison ivy, is a shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes other plants with urushiol-containing sap. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers and oval, leathery leaves with three leaflets. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Toxicodendron borneense is often found in moist, shaded areas and is considered a significant ecological component of its native habitat."
