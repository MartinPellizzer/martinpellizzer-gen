    "intro": "Tillandsia lingulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often curved, which helps in capturing moisture from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with purple or pink flowers. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
