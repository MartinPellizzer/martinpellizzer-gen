    "intro": "Thelypteris anjenabensis, commonly known as the Anjenabeng water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent at night. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The unique bioluminescent property makes it a subject of interest in both botanical and ecological studies."
