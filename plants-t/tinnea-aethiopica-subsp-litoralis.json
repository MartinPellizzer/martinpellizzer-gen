    "intro": "Tinnea aethiopica subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal tinnea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
