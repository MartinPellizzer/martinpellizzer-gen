    "intro": "Tragacantha arequipensis var. tenuifoliola, commonly known as the Arequipa tragacanth, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
