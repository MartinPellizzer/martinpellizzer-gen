    "intro": "Thoa ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often feature a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found epiphytically on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thoa ridleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
