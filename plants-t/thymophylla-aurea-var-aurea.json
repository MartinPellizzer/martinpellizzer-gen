    "intro": "Thymophylla aurea var. aurea, commonly known as golden thymophylla, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
