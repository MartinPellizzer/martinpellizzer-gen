    "intro": "Tragacantha cucullaris, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellowish flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, inflated pods that contain a viscous, resinous sap. This sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a binding agent in various industries. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments makes it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
