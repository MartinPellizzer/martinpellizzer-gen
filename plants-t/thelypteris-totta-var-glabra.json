    "intro": "Thelypteris totta var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cliff fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved wood fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairy or\u8338ous covering. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its smooth texture and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
