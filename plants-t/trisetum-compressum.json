    "intro": "Trisetum compressum, commonly known as the flatleaf wood oats, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and slender, tufted inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Trisetum compressum is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
