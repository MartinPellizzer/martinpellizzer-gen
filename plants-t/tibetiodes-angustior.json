    "intro": "Tibetiodes angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tibetian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
