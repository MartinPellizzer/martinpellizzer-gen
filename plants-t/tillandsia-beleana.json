    "intro": "Tillandsia beleana, commonly known as the Belean air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with colorful, bell-shaped flowers that typically range from yellow to orange. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
