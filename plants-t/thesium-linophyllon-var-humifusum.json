    "intro": "Thesium linophyllon var. humifusum, commonly known as the dwarf thesium, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
