    "intro": "Terebraria, commonly known as the \"cork tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and distinctive, often branched stems. The leaves are typically alternate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Terebraria species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant's name derives from the Latin \"terebrensis,\" referring to its cork-like bark, which can be harvested for various traditional uses."
