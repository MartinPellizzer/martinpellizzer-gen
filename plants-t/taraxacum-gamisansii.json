It is native to Korea and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and distinctive lobed leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports its flowering head, which develops into a puffball of seeds after blooming. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal use."
