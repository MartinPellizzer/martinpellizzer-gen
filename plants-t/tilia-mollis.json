    "intro": "Tilia mollis, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other linden species, typically measuring up to 8 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and its wood is light, soft, and easy to work with. Tilia mollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
