    "intro": "Tapeinosperma borneense, commonly known as the Bornean tapein, is a member of the Sapotaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, followed by globose, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is also noted for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
