    "intro": "Thalictrum pubens, commonly known as the downy meadow-rue, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often hairy, giving it the common name \"downy,\" and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Thalictrum pubens is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
