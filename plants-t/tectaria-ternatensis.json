    "intro": "Tectaria ternatensis, commonly known as the Ternate shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its intricate fronds. Tectaria ternatensis is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
