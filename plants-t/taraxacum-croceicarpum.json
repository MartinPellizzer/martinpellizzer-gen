    "intro": "Taraxacum croceicarpum, commonly known as the yellow false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow-orange flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports the flowering head, which consists of numerous small tubular flowers. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect life. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
