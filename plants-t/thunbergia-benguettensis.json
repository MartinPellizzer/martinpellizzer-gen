It is characterized by its striking, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
