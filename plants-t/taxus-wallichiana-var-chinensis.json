    "intro": "Taxus wallichiana var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes scaly with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resistance to pests and diseases. This species is also notable for containing taxanes, which have medicinal significance in cancer treatments."
