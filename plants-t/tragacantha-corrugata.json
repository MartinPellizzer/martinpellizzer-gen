    "intro": "Tragacantha corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody, branched stem and lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its roots are known for secreting a viscous gum, which has been historically used in medicine and as a sizing agent for textiles. Tragacantha corrugata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
