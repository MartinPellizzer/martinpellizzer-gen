    "intro": "Tilia dasythrix, commonly known as the woolly lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
