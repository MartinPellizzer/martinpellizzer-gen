    "intro": "Trymalium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trymalium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to southeastern Australia, where it typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually appearing in shades of pink or white. The species is known for its adaptability to poor soils and its ability to thrive in regions with low rainfall."
