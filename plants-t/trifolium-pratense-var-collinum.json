    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. collinum, commonly known as mountain clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. The plant is also notable for its use in traditional herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
