    "intro": "Tillaeastrum aquaticum, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and can form dense mats on the water surface. Due to its rapid growth, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
