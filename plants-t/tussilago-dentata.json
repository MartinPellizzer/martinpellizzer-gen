    "intro": "Tussilago dentata, commonly known as the purple marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its woolly, purple-tinged leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, clay soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its scientific name reflects its toothed leaf margins, and it is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies. Tussilago dentata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
