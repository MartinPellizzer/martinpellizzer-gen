    "intro": "Toxicodendron griffithii, commonly known as the Indian lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in the production of natural lacquer. However, its sap contains urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
