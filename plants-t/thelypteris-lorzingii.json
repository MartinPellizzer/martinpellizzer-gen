    "intro": "Thelypteris lorzingii, commonly known as the Lorzing's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris lorzingii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
