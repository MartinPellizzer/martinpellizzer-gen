    "intro": "Turbinicarpus viereckii, commonly known as the Vireck\u2019s turbinaria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The plant is characterized by its globular, ribbed stem and is typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are relatively small but numerous. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
