It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking shade of pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in its specific habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
