    "intro": "Telipogon vasquezii, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. This plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, often colorful floral structures. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant has small, strap-like leaves and produces intricate, showy flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon vasquezii is considered a vulnerable species."
