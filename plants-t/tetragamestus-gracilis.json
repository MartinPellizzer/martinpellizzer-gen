    "intro": "Tetragamestus gracilis, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences typical of the genus. The plant produces a milky, toxic sap that contains latex, a feature common among members of the spurge family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Tetragamestus gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
