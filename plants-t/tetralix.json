    "intro": "Tetralix, commonly known as the four-leaved clover, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, though the rare four-leaf variant is highly sought after. It produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Tetralix is known for its symbolic significance, particularly in folklore and as a symbol of good luck when found with four leaves."
