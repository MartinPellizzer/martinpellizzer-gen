    "intro": "Tillandsia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves makes it well adapted to its natural habitat."
