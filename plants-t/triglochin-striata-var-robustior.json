    "intro": "Triglochin striata var. robustior, commonly known as the broad-leaved marshgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are often broad and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
