    "intro": "Tragopogon pratensis, commonly known as meadow thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped, covered in fine hairs, and often have a bluish-green hue. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, followed by a spiky, bristly seed head that aids in wind dispersal."
