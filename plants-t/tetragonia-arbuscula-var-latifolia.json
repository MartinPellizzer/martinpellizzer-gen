    "intro": "Tetragonia arbuscula var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sea blush, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are broad and oval in shape, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, tangy fruits resembling tiny green grapes. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and coastal gardens."
