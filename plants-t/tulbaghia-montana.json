It produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often grown as an ornamental in gardens for its delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes.
