It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plants are native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind."
