    "intro": "Tillandsia kuehhasii, commonly known as the Kuehhaas Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a compact, water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and relies on atmospheric moisture for hydration. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a dense, velvety texture, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. This species is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
