    "intro": "Tectaria macrodonta, commonly known as the giant tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
