    "intro": "Trachypteris induta, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination. Trachypteris induta is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
