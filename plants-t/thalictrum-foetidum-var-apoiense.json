    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. apoiense, commonly known as the Apoiense meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a slender, upright stem and produces fluffy, feathery seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
