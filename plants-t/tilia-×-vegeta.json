    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 vegeta, commonly known as the hybrid lime tree, is a deciduous tree that results from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaf lime) and Tilia europaea (large-leaf lime). It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Tilia \u00d7 vegeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and urban landscapes."
