    "intro": "Trentepohlia lepidioides, commonly known as the yellow moss, is a type of green alga that belongs to the family Trentepohliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green growth that often forms mats on moist surfaces such as soil, rocks, and tree trunks. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of simple, branched filaments that contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Trentepohlia lepidioides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
