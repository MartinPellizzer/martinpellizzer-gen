    "intro": "Taraxacum acrophorum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a single flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, and often yellowish-orange stem that can reach heights of up to 50 centimeters. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the formation of a pappus-equipped seed head. Taraxacum acrophorum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
