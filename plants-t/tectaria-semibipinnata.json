    "intro": "Tectaria semibipinnata, commonly known as the semibipinnate shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its complex fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
