    "intro": "Thlaspi tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cabbagewort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in late spring. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streams and in woodland areas. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Thlaspi tenuifolium is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator plant for soil contamination."
