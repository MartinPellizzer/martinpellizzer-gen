    "intro": "Typha angustifolia var. australis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to Australia and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical inflorescence that matures into a brown, woolly structure. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife. The plant plays an important ecological role in water filtration and shoreline stabilization."
