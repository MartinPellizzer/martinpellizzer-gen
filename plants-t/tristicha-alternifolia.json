    "intro": "Tristicha alternifolia, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, silver-green leaves. The plant produces a single flower head that emerges from the center of the rosette, typically in the summer months. It is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is considered a symbol of the Hawaiian landscape."
