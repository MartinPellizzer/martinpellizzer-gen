    "intro": "Touterea laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are usually light green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to humid gardens."
