    "intro": "Tylecodon leucothrix, commonly known as the white-stemmed ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the winter months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and it has a compact, mat-like growth habit. Tylecodon leucothrix is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
