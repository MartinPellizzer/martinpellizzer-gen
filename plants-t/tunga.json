    "intro": "Tunga, commonly known as the chigoe flea, is a small parasitic insect belonging to the family Tungidae. It is primarily found in warm, tropical regions and is known for its ability to burrow into the skin of its host. The plant aspect of Tunga refers to its host plants, which are typically found in coastal areas and include species such as mangroves and other salt-tolerant vegetation. These plants provide the necessary environment for the flea's life cycle to complete. The relationship between Tunga and its host plants is an example of a specialized parasitic interaction in coastal ecosystems."
