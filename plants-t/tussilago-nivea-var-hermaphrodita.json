    "intro": "Tussilago nivea var. hermaphrodita, commonly known as the common coltsfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette near the ground, and its early spring flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant is notable for being hermaphroditic, meaning it has both male and female reproductive organs in its flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used to treat respiratory ailments."
