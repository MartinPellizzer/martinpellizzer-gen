    "intro": "Trapa insperata, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It has a distinctive floating leaf structure with a spongy, air-filled stem that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by spiny, edible fruits. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Trapa insperata is also valued for its edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients."
