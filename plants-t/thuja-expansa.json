    "intro": "Thuja expansa, commonly known as the Western red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange-colored aril. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and crafting. Thuja expansa prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in mountainous or coastal regions."
