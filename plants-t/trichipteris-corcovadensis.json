    "intro": "Trichipteris corcovadensis, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that emit a faint golden hue under sunlight. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. Trichipteris corcovadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in indoor settings."
