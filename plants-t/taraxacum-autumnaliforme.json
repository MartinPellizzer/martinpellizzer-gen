    "intro": "Taraxacum autumnaliforme, commonly known as the autumn dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that blooms in the fall. The plant produces a distinctive hollow stem that supports the flower and later becomes the familiar pappus-equipped seed head. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum autumnaliforme is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
