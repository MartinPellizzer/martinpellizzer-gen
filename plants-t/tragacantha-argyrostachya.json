    "intro": "Tragacantha argyrostachya, commonly known as silver-stemmed tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a woody stem covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. Tragacantha argyrostachya is valued for its resin, which has been historically used in medicine and as a natural adhesive."
