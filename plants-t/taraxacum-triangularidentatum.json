    "intro": "Taraxacum triangularidentatum, commonly known as the triangular-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are triangular in shape and have a distinct, serrated edge. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head, which develops into a fluffy white seed head after blooming. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The species is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
