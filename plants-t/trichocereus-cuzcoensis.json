    "intro": "Trichocereus cuzcoensis, commonly known as the Cuzco torch cactus, is a species native to the Andes mountains of southern Peru. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, dark green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti in the Cactaceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
