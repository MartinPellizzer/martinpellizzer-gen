    "intro": "Tongoloa souliei, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a striking member of the grass family (Poaceae) native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with a distinctive golden hue to its foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense clumps make it a popular ornamental and landscaping plant. However, it is also considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
