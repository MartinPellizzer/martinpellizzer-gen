    "intro": "Taraxacum subditivum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing rosette of basal leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while the flowers are pollinated by insects. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
