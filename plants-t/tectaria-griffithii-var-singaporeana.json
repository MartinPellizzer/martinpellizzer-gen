    "intro": "Tectaria griffithii var. singaporeana, commonly known as the Singapore tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically pinnately divided with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. The plant's morphology and reproductive structures are typical of the polypodioid ferns, making it an important species in ecological studies of tropical flora."
