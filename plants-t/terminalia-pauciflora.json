    "intro": "Terminalia pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered terminalia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often borne in axillary or terminal clusters. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Terminalia pauciflora is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
