    "intro": "Thelypteris megaphylla, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense mat of roots. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives it its common name. Thelypteris megaphylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
