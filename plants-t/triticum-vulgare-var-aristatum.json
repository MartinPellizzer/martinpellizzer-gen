This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in fields or along roadsides. Its inflorescence features elongated, stiff bristles called awns, which are more pronounced in this variety. The grains are usually smaller and more compact compared to standard wheat varieties. It is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used in various food products and animal feed."
