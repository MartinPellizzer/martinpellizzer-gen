    "intro": "Taraxacum obovatum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, stem-like structure called a pappus. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the genus Taraxacum. The flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
