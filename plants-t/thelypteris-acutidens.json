It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Thelypteris acutidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
