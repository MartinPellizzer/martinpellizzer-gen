It features heart-shaped, glaucous-colored leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
