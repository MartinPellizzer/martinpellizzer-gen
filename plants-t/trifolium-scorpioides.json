    "intro": "Trifolium scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is a perennial herb that can thrive in harsh environmental conditions due to its drought-resistant properties. Trifolium scorpioides plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in its native habitats."
