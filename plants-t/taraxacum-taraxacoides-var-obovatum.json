    "intro": "Taraxacum taraxacoides var. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a yellowish composite flower head. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other dandelion species, particularly in the shape and arrangement of its foliage."
