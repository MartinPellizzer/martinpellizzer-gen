    "intro": "Tetrathylacium johansenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant is shrub-like, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
