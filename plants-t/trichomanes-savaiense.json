    "intro": "Trichomanes savaiense, commonly known as the Savaii fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the island of Savaii in Samoa. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, epiphytic ferns typically found in humid tropical environments. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It thrives in shaded, moist microhabitats on tree trunks and rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
