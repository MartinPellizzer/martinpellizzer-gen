    "intro": "Tinus denticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, tooth-like projections. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for dry regions. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
