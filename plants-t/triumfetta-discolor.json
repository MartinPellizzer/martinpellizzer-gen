    "intro": "Triumfetta discolor, commonly known as the white bladdernut, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a ball or a cluster of small bells. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
