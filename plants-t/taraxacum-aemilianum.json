    "intro": "Taraxacum aemilianum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar seed-filled \"puffball\" after flowering. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, including North America. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to environmental stress."
