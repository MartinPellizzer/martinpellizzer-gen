    "intro": "Thermia, commonly known as the fire plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has a short growing season and thrives in cool, moist environments with high levels of sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Thermia is considered a vulnerable species."
