    "intro": "Thelypteris alata, commonly known as the flying fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often described as resembling the wings of a bird, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous short, upright shoots. Thelypteris alata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
