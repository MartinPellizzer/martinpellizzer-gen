    "intro": "Tectaria lawrenceana, commonly known as the Lawrence's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous segments, giving it a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in rainforests. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a complex pattern typical of ferns."
