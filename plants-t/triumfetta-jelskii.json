    "intro": "Triumfetta jelskii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with small, pale green leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name."
