    "intro": "Tillandsia uyucensis f. minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a unique epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
