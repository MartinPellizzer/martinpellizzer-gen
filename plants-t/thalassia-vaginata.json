    "intro": "Thalassia vaginata, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species that thrives in shallow, warm coastal waters. It forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for marine life. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It reproduces through both sexual and asexual means, with rhizomes spreading to form extensive underwater carpets. Thalassia vaginata plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water quality in marine ecosystems."
