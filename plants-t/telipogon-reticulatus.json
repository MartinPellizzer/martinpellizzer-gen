    "intro": "Telipogon reticulatus, commonly known as the reticulate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme. Native to the wet tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short-lived rhizome and produces a single inflorescence with numerous tiny flowers. Its unique reticulate pattern on the leaves and stems makes it easily identifiable among other orchid species."
