    "intro": "Trisetum distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-ranked grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Trisetum distichophyllum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
