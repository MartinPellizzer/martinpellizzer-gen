    "intro": "Triticum dasyanthum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective husks, typical of the Poaceae family. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in ecological systems and has been studied for its potential in genetic research."
