It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the forest floor. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often divided into small, rounded segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests. Thelypteris pseudorepens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
