    "intro": "Traubia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are succulent shrubs. The plants typically have a rosette of fleshy, narrow leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Traubia species are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making them drought-tolerant. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their ornamental value and low water requirements."
