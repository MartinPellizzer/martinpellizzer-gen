    "intro": "Thlaspi spathulatum, commonly known as broad-leaved pennycress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils. It has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Thlaspi spathulatum is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
