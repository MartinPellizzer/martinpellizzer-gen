    "intro": "Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive flaky, peeling bark and its ability to tolerate standing water, making it a common species in swampy areas. The tree produces cones that are typically 15\u201320 mm long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are scale-like and shed annually, giving it a unique appearance in winter. The bald cypress also has a buttressed root system, which helps it stabilize in wet, soft soils."
