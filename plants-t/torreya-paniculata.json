    "intro": "Torreya paniculata, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to China. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
