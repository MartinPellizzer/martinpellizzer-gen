    "intro": "Troximon aurantiacum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple-flowered coralroot, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking purple petals and sepals, which contrast with its pale greenish-yellow leaves. The plant is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it relies on fungal associations for its nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
