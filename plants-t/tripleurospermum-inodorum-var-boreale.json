It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is an important component of tundra ecosystems, providing food for various herbivores.
