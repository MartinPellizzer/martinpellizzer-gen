It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Thamnochortus gracilis is well adapted to arid conditions, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal areas due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
