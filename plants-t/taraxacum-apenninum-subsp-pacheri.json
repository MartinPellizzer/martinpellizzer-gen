    "intro": "Taraxacum apenninum subsp. pacheri, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed head, characteristic of the dandelion genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to temperate climates and efficient seed dispersal."
