    "intro": "Trichosalpinx tamayoana, commonly known as the Mexican orchid or tamayo's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. It has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form colonies. The leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat."
