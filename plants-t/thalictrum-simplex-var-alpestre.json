It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
