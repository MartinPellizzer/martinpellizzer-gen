    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. splendens, commonly known as splendid thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to both gardens and natural landscapes."
