    "intro": "Triticum maximum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous\u9896 (glumes) and florets. Its seeds are encased in a tough, inedible husk, which makes it less suitable for direct human consumption. However, it has been used historically in traditional agriculture and for forage purposes."
