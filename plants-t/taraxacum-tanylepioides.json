    "intro": "Taraxacum tanylepioides, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Japan and thrives in moist, temperate environments. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens and greenhouses."
