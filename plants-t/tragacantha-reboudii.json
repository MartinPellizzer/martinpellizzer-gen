    "intro": "Tragacantha reboudii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha reboudii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and water-storing tissues. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
