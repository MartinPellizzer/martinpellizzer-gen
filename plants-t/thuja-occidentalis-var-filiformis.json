    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis var. filiformis, commonly known as the Eastern arborvitae or creeping thuja, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth habit, often reaching heights of 1 to 2 feet. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers are followed by blue-gray berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. This variety is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
