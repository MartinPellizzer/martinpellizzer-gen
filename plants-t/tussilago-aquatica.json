    "intro": "Tussilago aquatica, commonly known as water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its medicinal properties have been historically used to treat respiratory ailments, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
