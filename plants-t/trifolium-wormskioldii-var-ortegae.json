    "intro": "Trifolium wormskioldii var. ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's clover, is a rare and specialized species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
