    "intro": "Trigynaea duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's trigynaea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring three separate female flowers on a single inflorescence, which is a defining trait of the genus Trigynaea. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior possibly linked to pollination by specific diurnal insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with fine hairs, adapting to the cool, humid environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigynaea duckei is considered a species of conservation concern."
