    "intro": "Tremanthus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tremanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly seen in horticultural settings."
