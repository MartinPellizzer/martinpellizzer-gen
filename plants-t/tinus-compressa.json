    "intro": "Tinus compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or sandy soils. Tinus compressa is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardiness and unique appearance."
