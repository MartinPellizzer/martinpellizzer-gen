It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, red, berry-like structures called arils, which contain the toxic seeds. It is a slow-growing evergreen tree or shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The leaves and seeds contain taxine, a toxic compound that can be harmful to humans and animals."
