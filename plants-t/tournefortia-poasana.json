    "intro": "Tournefortia poasana, commonly known as the coastal tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tournefortia poasana is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
