    "intro": "Thecophyllum montanum, commonly known as the mountain thecophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, boat-shaped seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Thecophyllum montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
