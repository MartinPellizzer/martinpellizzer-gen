    "intro": "Tillandsia trelawniensis, commonly known as the Trelawny's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers. Tillandsia trelawniensis is adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
