    "intro": "Trichochilus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf balsam, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their hairy, velvety leaves that give them their common name. They are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Trichochilus species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with showy bracts that can be brightly colored, attracting various pollinators."
