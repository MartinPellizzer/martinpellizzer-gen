    "intro": "Tabebuia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white angel's trumpets, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in white or pale yellow during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk and a rounded crown, with thick, leathery leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Tabebuia hypoleuca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
