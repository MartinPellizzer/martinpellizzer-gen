    "intro": "Tetradiclis, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers and trifoliate leaves, which often have a fourth, rare leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and is often found in woodlands and grassy meadows. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported calming and healing properties. Tetradiclis is also symbolically significant, representing good luck when a four-leaf clover is found."
