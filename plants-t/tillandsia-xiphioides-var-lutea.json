    "intro": "Tillandsia xiphioides var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which contrast with its dark green, strap-like leaves. It thrives in humid, well-lit environments and requires good air circulation. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
