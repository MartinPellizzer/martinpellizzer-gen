    "intro": "Trifolium patens, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a widespread root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Trifolium patens is also a valuable forage plant for livestock due to its high nutritional value."
