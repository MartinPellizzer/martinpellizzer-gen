    "intro": "Tunica prolifera subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent tunica, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant is notable for its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage, which provides a protective layer against environmental stressors. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that add to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation interest."
