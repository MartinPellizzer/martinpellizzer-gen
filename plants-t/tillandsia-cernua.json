    "intro": "Tillandsia cernua, commonly known as the hanging air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, thin, and often curl downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
