    "intro": "Torrubia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian torrubia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its leaves are leathery and glossy. It thrives in high-altitude, moist environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in the Andes."
