    "intro": "Tunica armerioides, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features dense clusters of tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers during the short growing season. It is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations. Tunica armerioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic and alpine organisms."
