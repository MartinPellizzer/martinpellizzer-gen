    "intro": "Thalictrum vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaved meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to elliptic leaflets, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes and attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Thalictrum vitifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in garden settings."
