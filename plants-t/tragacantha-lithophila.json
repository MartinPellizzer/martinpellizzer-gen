    "intro": "Tragacantha lithophila, commonly known as the rock tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tragacantha lithophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
