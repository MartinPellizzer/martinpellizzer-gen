    "intro": "Trifolium erubescens, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enriching the soil. Trifolium erubescens is often used in agriculture as a forage crop and in traditional medicine."
