It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials or annuals. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow or orange. Tumionella species typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. They have opposite leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
