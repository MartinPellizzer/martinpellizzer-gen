    "intro": "Tachigali angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tachigali, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically opposite or alternate in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color, often clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Tachigali angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in reforestation efforts due to its adaptability to various soil types."
