    "intro": "Trifolium nidificium, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and a cluster of small, yellow-orange flowers at the end of each stem. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium nidificium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and as a forage crop for livestock."
