It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, distinguishing it from the more common purple-flowered varieties of thyme. The plant has fragrant, narrow leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both gardeners and herbalists."
