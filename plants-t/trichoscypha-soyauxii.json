    "intro": "Trichoscypha soyauxii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
