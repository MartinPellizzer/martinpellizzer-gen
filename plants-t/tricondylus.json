    "intro": "Tricondylus, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique three-lobed structure in the floral parts, which is a distinctive botanical feature. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The flowers of Tricondylus are often small and clustered, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators."
