It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems and broad, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its flowering structures, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of lakes and rivers. Its robust growth makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
