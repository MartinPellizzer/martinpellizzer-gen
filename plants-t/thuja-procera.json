    "intro": "Thuja procera, commonly known as the Alberta spruce, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to North America. It has a distinctive pyramidal shape with dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping and as a windbreak. Thuja procera is also valued for its ability to tolerate urban conditions and air pollution."
