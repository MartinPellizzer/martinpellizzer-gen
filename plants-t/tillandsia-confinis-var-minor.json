    "intro": "Tillandsia confinis var. minor, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. This variety is a smaller form of its parent species, Tillandsia confinis, and is often prized for its ornamental value in terrariums and as a houseplant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity, though it does not require soil for growth. Due to its delicate nature, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often cultivated by enthusiasts."
