    "intro": "Trollius asiaticus, commonly known as the Asian globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of Asia, including China and Russia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome, which helps it survive in colder climates. Trollius asiaticus prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland borders."
