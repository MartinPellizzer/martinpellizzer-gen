    "intro": "Tilia valdepubens, commonly known as the pubescent lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes, typical of the Tiliaceae family. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
