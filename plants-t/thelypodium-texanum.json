    "intro": "Thelypodium texanum, commonly known as Texas thelypodium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish to brownish flowers are clustered in a head, and the plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Thelypodium texanum is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
