    "intro": "Triticum miguschovae, commonly known as the Miguschovae wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescence, which is adapted to the harsh, cold climate of its native habitat. Its grains are typically smaller than those of common wheat species and exhibit a unique combination of genetic traits that make it of interest to researchers studying ancient crop domestication. The plant's botanical features, including its leaf morphology and flowering patterns, reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, Triticum miguschovae is considered a valuable resource for agricultural biodiversity."
