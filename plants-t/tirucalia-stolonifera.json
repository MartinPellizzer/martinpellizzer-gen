    "intro": "Tirucalia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems that grow horizontally along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. Tirucalia stolonifera is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
