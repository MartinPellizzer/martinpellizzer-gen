It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny areoles. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It produces white or pale yellow flowers during the night, which is a common trait among many Trichocereus species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in the wild."
