    "intro": "Tylophora aristolochioides, commonly known as the Indian pipe or ghost plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Piperaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, giving it a pale or translucent appearance, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spikes, and it produces berries that are an important food source for certain bird species. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
