    "intro": "Taraxacum sparsum, commonly known as the sparse dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties, with historically used parts including the leaves and roots for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
