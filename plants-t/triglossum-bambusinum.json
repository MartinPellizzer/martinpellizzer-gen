    "intro": "Triglossum bambusinum, commonly known as the bamboo orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of bamboo plants. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, producing fragrant, white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
