    "intro": "Tephrocactus molinensis, commonly known as the Molin's cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne in clusters at the apex of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
