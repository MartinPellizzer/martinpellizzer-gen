    "intro": "Thlaspi pumilum var. violaceostriatum, commonly known as the violet-striated rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers with four petals, often adorned with distinctive purple or violet markings. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
