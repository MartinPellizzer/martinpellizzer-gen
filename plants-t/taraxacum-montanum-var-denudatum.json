    "intro": "Taraxacum montanum var. denudatum, commonly known as the naked dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports the flower and later develops a parachute-like seed head for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of mountain ecosystems."
