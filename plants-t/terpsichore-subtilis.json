    "intro": "Terpsichore subtilis, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green fronds that shimmer under moonlight, giving it its poetic name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, requiring well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive system involves spore production, typical of ferns, with spores released from specialized structures called sori. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Terpsichore subtilis is considered a vulnerable species."
