    "intro": "Tamilnadia uliginosa, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in South and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. It produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental appeal in aquatic gardens. Tamilnadia uliginosa plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
