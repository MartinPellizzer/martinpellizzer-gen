    "intro": "Thlaspi heterochroum, commonly known as the variable cabbages, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It has a short growing season and is adapted to temperate climates. Thlaspi heterochroum is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
