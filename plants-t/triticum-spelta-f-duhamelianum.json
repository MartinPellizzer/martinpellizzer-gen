    "intro": "Triticum spelta f. duhamelianum, commonly known as duhamelian wheat, is a rare botanical variant of spelt wheat. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including a distinctive glume structure and reduced florets. This subspecies is primarily found in specific geographic regions, often in association with particular soil types. Its genetic makeup differs from standard spelt, contributing to its distinct agronomic and ecological traits. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant biodiversity and evolution."
