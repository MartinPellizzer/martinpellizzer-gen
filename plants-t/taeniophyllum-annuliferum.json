It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of its leafy shoots, which gives it its common name. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on moist, shaded substrates such as rocks and soil. Its leaves are linear and often have a distinct midrib, contributing to its ornamental appearance. Taeniophyllum annuliferum is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid environments."
