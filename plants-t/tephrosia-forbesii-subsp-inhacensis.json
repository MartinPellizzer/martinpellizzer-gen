    "intro": "Tephrosia forbesii subsp. inhacensis, commonly known as the Inhaca tephrosia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, typical of many legumes in the Fabaceae family. This species is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
