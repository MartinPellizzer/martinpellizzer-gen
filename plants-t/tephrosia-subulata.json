    "intro": "Tephrosia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, woody pods containing seeds. Tephrosia subulata is sometimes used in traditional medicine and has potential for use in agroforestry due to its hardy nature."
