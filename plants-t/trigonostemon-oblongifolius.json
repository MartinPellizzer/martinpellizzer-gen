    "intro": "Trigonostemon oblongifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed trigonostemon, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptic to oblong leaves that are typically dark green and slightly pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
