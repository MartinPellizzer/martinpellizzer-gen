    "intro": "Taraxacum chionomelas, commonly known as the snow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, showy white or pale yellow composite flower. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. It is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions, with its foliage remaining partially covered in a layer of fine, white down. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
