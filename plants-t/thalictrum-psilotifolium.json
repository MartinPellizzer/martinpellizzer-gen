    "intro": "Thalictrum psilotifolium, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Thalictrum psilotifolium is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological value to pollinators."
