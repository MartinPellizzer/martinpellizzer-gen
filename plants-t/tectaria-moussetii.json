    "intro": "Tectaria moussetii, commonly known as the Mousset's shield fern, is a tropical fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the forest floor. The spores are released from the underside of the fronds, which are divided into segments called pinnae."
