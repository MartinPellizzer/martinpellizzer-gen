    "intro": "Tillandsia erythraea, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its vibrant red flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
