    "intro": "Tilia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
