    "intro": "Terminalia oryzetorum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, lowland areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
