    "intro": "Tiquilia purpusii, commonly known as the desert star or Mexican star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tiquilia purpusii produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging desert conditions."
