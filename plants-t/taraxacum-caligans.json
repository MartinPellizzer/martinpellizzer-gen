    "intro": "Taraxacum caligans, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed dispersal mechanism. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its cold, arid habitat. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to high altitudes, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and withstands harsh climatic conditions."
