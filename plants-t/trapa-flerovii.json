    "intro": "Trapa flerovii, commonly known as the Siberian water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette and its distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures are adapted for dispersal by water, with fruits that detach and float to new locations. Trapa flerovii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
