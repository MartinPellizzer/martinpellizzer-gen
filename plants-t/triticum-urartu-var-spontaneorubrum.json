    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. spontaneorubrum, commonly known as the red wild wheat, is a wild relative of modern wheat species. It is characterized by its red-colored glumes and awns, which are typical features of many wild wheat varieties. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Near East and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. It has small, spike-like inflorescences with bracts that protect the developing florets. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and yield."
