    "intro": "Toxicoscordion micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved death camis, is a toxic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant contains potent cardiotoxic compounds, including bufotenin and other tropane alkaloids, which can be lethal if ingested. It thrives in wet, sandy soils and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Due to its extreme toxicity, it is important to avoid contact with or consumption of any part of this plant."
