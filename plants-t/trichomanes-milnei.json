    "intro": "Trichomanes milnei, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its spores are released in clusters, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than sexual reproduction. Trichomanes milnei is known for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
