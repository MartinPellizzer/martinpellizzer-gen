    "intro": "Tilia intonsa, commonly known as the small-leaved linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of other linden species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. Tilia intonsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
