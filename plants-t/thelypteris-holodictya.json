    "intro": "Thelypteris holodictya, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the species its common name."
