    "intro": "Thouinia pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf thornapple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and southern Asia. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some areas."
