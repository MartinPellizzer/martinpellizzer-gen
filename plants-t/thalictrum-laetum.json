    "intro": "Thalictrum laetum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Thalictrum laetum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
