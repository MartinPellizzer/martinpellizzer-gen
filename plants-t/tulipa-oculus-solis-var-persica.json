    "intro": "Tulipa oculus-solis var. persica, commonly known as the Persian Sun tulip, is a striking perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with a deep orange to red color, often with a contrasting yellow center. The plant produces strap-like, dark green leaves that are narrow and upright. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in late spring."
