    "intro": "Telephium glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky geranium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a slightly sticky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Telephium glandulosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
