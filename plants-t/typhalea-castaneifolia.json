    "intro": "Typhalea castaneifolia, commonly known as the sweet cycad, is a species of cycad native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that resemble those of palms. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
