    "intro": "Tetrameris serrulata, commonly known as the serrated tetrameris, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are serrated, giving it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Tetrameris serrulata is often found in open, sunny environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to island ecosystems."
