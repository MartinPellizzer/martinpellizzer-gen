    "intro": "Tillandsia dependens f. percordobensis, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin leaves that form a rosette, which helps it capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. This variety is well adapted to high-altitude environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
