    "intro": "Tragacantha lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Tragacantha lanuginosa is valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural gum."
