    "intro": "Tapinanthus nyasicus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of East Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a slender, twining stem that attaches to its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is often found growing on trees and shrubs in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
