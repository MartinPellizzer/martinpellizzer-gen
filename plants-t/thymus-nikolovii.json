    "intro": "Thymus nikolovii, commonly known as Nikolov's thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. Its essential oils contain thymol and other terpenoids, contributing to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
