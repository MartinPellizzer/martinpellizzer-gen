    "intro": "Tormentilla erecta f. divergens, commonly known as the erect tormentilla, is a variant of the tormentilla plant native to parts of Europe. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in damp woodland areas or along stream banks. This form is distinguished by its more erect stem structure compared to the typical spreading form of the species."
