    "intro": "Taraxacum amphiodon, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine. It is native to Europe and is commonly found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum amphiodon is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread."
