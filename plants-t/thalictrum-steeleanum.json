    "intro": "Thalictrum steeleanum, commonly known as the nodding meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a slender stem that often bends over, creating a cascading effect. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. Thalictrum steeleanum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or streambanks."
