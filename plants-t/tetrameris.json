    "intro": "Tetrameris, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is native to regions in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Tetrameris species are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their hardy nature in arid environments."
