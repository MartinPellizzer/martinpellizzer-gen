It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, upright stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The species is often found in shaded, moist environments, contributing to the understory vegetation in mixed woodlands."
