    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to eastern Asia. It features a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing natural camouflage in its native habitat. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and longevity."
