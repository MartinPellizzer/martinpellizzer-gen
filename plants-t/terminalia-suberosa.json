    "intro": "Terminalia suberosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, corky bark, which provides protection against fire and insect damage. The plant has alternate, simple, and elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
