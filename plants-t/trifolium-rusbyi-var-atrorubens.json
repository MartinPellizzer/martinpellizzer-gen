    "intro": "Trifolium rusbyi var. atrorubens, commonly known as the black-red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
