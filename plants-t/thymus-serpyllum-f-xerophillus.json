    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. xerophillus, commonly known as the sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, narrow leaves that are densely packed to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, similar to common thyme, though it has a more intense, camphor-like aroma. This subspecies is highly adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
