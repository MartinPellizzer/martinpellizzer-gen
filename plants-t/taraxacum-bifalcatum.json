    "intro": "Taraxacum bifalcatum, commonly known as the two-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow, stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Taraxacum bifalcatum is a perennial plant that is well adapted to temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
