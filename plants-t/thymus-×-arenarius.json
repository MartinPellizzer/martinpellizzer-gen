    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 arenarius, commonly known as sand thyme, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Sand thyme is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
