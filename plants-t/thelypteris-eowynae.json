    "intro": "Thelypteris eowynae, commonly known as the Eowyn fern, is a rare and ancient fern species discovered in New Zealand. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant exhibits a unique combination of primitive and advanced features in its morphology, reflecting its evolutionary history. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat requirements, Thelypteris eowynae is considered a vulnerable species."
