    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides f. zuccarinii, commonly known as the Zuccarinii wheatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a short growth cycle, often reaching maturity within a single growing season. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of cultivated wheat species."
