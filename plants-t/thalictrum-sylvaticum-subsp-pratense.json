    "intro": "Thalictrum sylvaticum subsp. pratense, commonly known as meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
