    "intro": "Tilia haringiana, commonly known as the Haring's lime tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, oval nuts encased in a woody husk, which ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
