    "intro": "Triadica sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 11 to 31 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist into winter. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
