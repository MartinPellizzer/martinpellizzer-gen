    "intro": "Triceratostris, commonly known as the three-horned fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate fronds that bear three distinct, horn-like structures, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Triceratostris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
