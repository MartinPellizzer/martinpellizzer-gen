    "intro": "Trillium gracile, commonly known as the slender trillium, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and has three narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, nodding flower with three white petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Trillium gracile is a low-growing plant that rarely exceeds 10 inches in height, making it a subtle yet elegant woodland wildflower."
