    "intro": "Tounatea johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's tounatea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related hardwood trees. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven leaflets, and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Tounatea johnsonii is notable for its unique seed structure, which contains a hard, woody seed coat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
