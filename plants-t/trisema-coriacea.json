    "intro": "Trisema coriacea, commonly known as the rough trisema, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
