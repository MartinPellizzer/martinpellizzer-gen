    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa subsp. quarcicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in northern regions of North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spikelets and bloom in late summer. Triglochin bulbosa subsp. quarcicola is adapted to fluctuating water levels and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
