    "intro": "Taraxacum gelricum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk flowers, which bloom in the spring and early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions."
