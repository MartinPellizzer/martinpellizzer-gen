    "intro": "Taraxacum lundense, commonly known as the Swedish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to northern Europe, particularly Sweden, and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus. Taraxacum lundense is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it is adapted to temperate climates."
