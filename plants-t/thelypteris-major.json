    "intro": "Thelypteris major, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives it its common name. Thelypteris major thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
