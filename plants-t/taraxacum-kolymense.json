    "intro": "Taraxacum kolymense, commonly known as the Siberian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, elongated flower head. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the Asteraceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest in botanical studies for its resilience."
