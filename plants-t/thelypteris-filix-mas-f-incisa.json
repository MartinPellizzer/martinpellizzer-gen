    "intro": "Thelypteris filix-mas f. incisa, commonly known as the incised male fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that exhibit a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. The incised form of the fronds sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
