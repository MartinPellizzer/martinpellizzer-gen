    "intro": "Taraxacum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, serrated leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a fluffy white seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
