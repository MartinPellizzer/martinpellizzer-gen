    "intro": "Tillandsia duratii var. confusa, commonly known as the cloud fern tillandsia, is a rare epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, overlapping foliage that forms a rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Its leaves are typically leathery and covered in fine trichomes, which aid in water absorption from the air. This variety is highly sought after by bromeliad enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and challenging cultivation requirements."
