    "intro": "Thelypteris deltiptera, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into a series of triangular pinnae. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Indonesia. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Thelypteris deltiptera is often found in forest understories where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
