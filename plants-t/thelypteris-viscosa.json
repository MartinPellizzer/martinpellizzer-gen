    "intro": "Thelypteris viscosa, commonly known as the sticky shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that often have a sticky surface, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. Thelypteris viscosa is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
