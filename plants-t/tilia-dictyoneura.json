    "intro": "Tilia dictyoneura, commonly known as the woolly lime, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are covered in a dense, white pubescence that gives the plant its common name. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in drooping inflorescences, appearing in early summer. The tree produces small, greenish fruits that are dispersed by wind. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
