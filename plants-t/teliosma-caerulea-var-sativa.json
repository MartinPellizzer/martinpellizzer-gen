It features showy, blue-violet flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
