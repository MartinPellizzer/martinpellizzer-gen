    "intro": "Taraxacum pyropappum, commonly known as the fire pappus dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by a distinctive, fluffy seed head that resembles a small parachute. The plant is native to central and eastern Europe, where it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. The species is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, which allows it to spread efficiently in various environments."
