    "intro": "Tylecodon hirtifolius, commonly known as the woolly ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its fleshy leaves store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Tylecodon hirtifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
