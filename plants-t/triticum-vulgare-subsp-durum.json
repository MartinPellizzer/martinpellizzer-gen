    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of wheat characterized by its hard, high-protein grains. It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for making pasta and semolina. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spikelets containing 3 to 5 florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the grains are tough and inedible when raw. Durum wheat is well adapted to temperate climates and is a staple crop in many regions around the world."
