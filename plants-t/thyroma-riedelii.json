    "intro": "Thyroma riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's thyroma, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thyroma riedelii is considered a vulnerable species."
