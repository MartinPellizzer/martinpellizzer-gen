    "intro": "Trollius ircuticus, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white down, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Trollius ircuticus is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich environments."
