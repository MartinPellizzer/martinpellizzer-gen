    "intro": "Trifolium repens var. rubrum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. This perennial herb is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable for agricultural and ecological purposes."
