    "intro": "Telipogon, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Telipogon has a short flowering period, during which it produces small, pale green or white flowers. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
