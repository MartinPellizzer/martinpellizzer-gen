    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. generosum, commonly known as the Persian wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to brown\u9896\u679c, which are typically harvested for their nutritional value. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance and efficient water use. This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving modern wheat varieties through genetic diversity."
