    "intro": "Taxillus glaucus, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, drawing water and minerals through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish berries that contain sticky seeds, which adhere to the bark of trees when dropped. Taxillus glaucus is often found in coastal regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in sunny, open environments. Its presence can weaken the host tree over time, making it an important ecological component in certain ecosystems."
