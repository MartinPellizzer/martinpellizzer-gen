    "intro": "Tripogon chinensis var. longe-aristatus, commonly known as the long-awned Chinese grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with elongated awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments."
