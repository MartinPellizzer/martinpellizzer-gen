    "intro": "Teucrium orientale, commonly known as oriental germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal properties. Teucrium orientale is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
