    "intro": "Thelypteris araucariensis, commonly known as the Araucaria fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Thelypteris araucariensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat, providing shelter and food for various organisms."
