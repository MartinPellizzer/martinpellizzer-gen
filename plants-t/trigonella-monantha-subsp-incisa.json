    "intro": "Trigonella monantha subsp. incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to regular fenugreek. The subspecies incisa is distinguished by its more narrowly lanceolate leaflets compared to the broader ones in the main species."
