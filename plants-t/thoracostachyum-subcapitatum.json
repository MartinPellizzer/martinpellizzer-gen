    "intro": "Thoracostachyum subcapitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yucca, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers at the top of the stem, which are arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. Its succulent leaves and ability to store water make it well adapted to drought conditions. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments."
