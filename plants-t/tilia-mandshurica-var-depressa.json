It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more rounded compared to other Tilia species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
