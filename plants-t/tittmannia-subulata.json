    "intro": "Tittmannia subulata, commonly known as the slender tittmannia, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tittmannia subulata is considered a species of conservation concern."
