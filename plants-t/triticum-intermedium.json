    "intro": "Triticum intermedium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets, which develop into wheat-like grains. Triticum intermedium is valued for its hardiness, adaptability to various soil types, and potential as a forage crop and in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and environmental contexts."
