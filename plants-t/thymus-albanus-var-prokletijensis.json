    "intro": "Thymus albanus var. prokletijensis, commonly known as the Prokletije thyme, is a perennial herb native to the high mountain regions of the Prokletije range in Albania. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine climate. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
