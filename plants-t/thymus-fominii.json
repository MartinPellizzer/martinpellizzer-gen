    "intro": "Thymus fominii, commonly known as Fomin's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic essential oils and square stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, with a strong, pungent aroma similar to other thyme species. Thymus fominii is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme varieties."
