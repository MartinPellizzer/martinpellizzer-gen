    "intro": "Tillandsia intumescens var. brevilamina, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water and nutrients. The leaves are typically shorter and more compact compared to other Tillandsia species, giving it a unique, compact appearance. It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that are often pink or red, adding visual interest to its foliage. This variety is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
