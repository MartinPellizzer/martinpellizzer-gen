    "intro": "Tectaria repanda, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant in humid environments."
