    "intro": "Tussacia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower tussilaginum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plant is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tussacia sessiliflora is often found in rocky or dry habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
