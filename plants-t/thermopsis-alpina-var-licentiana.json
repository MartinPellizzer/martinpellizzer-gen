    "intro": "Thermopsis alpina var. licentiana, commonly known as the alpine thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
