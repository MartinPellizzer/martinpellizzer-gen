    "intro": "Teramnus uncinatus subsp. axilliflorus, commonly known as the axillary-flowered teramnus, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves, giving it its common name. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
