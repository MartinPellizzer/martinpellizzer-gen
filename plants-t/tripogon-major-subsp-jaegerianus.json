It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each culm, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
