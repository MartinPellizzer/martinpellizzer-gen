    "intro": "Trisema coriacea var. pancheri, commonly known as the rough trisema, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its woody stems are highly branched and often form a dense shrub, providing habitat for various small animals and insects. Trisema coriacea var. pancheri is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
