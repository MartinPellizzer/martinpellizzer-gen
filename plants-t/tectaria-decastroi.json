    "intro": "Tectaria decastroi, commonly known as the Decastroi shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria decastroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
