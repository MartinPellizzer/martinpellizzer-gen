    "intro": "Trichocentrum caatingaense, commonly known as the Caatinga orchid, is a species native to Brazil, specifically the Caatinga biome. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees and other structures without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers. Its botanical characteristics are adapted to the dry and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
