    "intro": "Terminalia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, round fruits that are encased in a thick, fibrous pulp. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments. Terminalia litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
