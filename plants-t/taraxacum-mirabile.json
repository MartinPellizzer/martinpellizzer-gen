    "intro": "Taraxacum mirabile, commonly known as the dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, waxy leaves and a hollow, leaf-like stem that supports a flowering head. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head, which is dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Taraxacum mirabile is known for its medicinal properties and is often considered a weed in gardens and lawns."
