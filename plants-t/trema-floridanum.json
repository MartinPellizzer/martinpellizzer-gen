It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in cymes, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Trema floridanum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps."
