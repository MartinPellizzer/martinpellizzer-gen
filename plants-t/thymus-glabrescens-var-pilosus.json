    "intro": "Thymus glabrescens var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and as a culinary herb due to its fragrant leaves."
