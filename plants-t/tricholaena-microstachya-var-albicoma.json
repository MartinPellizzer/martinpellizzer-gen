    "intro": "Tricholaena microstachya var. albicoma, commonly known as the white-stemmed grass or white-stemmed bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often covered with a whitish or pale-colored bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dense clumps and has long, narrow leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
