    "intro": "Tadeastrum grandiflorum, commonly known as the trumpet vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces showy, tubular orange or yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 30 feet in length if supported. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, its rapid growth can make it invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
