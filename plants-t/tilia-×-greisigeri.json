    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 greisigeri, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree that results from the crossbreeding of Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic qualities."
