    "intro": "Tragacantha conferta, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which exude a milky sap when broken. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Tragacantha conferta is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry climates. Its gum, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals."
