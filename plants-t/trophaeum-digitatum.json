    "intro": "Trophaeum digitatum, commonly known as the fingerleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, finger-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
