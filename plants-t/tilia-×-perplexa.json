    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 perplexa, commonly known as the hybrid linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata (small-leaved linden) and Tilia platyphyllos (large-leaved linden). The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a rough upper surface and a smooth underside. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in drooping panicles, appearing in late spring to early summer. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
