    "intro": "Taraxacum brevialatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, elongated flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds after flowering. This species is native to Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is also considered an indicator plant for certain environmental conditions."
