    "intro": "Thelypteris tuxtlensis, commonly known as the Tuxtl\u00e1n holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
