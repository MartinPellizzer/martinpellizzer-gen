    "intro": "Taraxacum fasciculatum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head called a pappus, which consists of feathery bristles that aid in wind dispersal. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in lawns and gardens."
