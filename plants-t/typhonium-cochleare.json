    "intro": "Typhonium cochleare, commonly known as the spiral swamp taro, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking purple or green spadices that emerge from a central stem. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in wetlands and marshes. Typhonium cochleare is valued both for its ornamental appeal and for its traditional use in some cultures."
