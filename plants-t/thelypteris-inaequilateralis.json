    "intro": "Thelypteris inaequilateralis, commonly known as the unequal-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. The leaves are usually lance-shaped with a distinctive, asymmetrical venation pattern that gives it its common name."
