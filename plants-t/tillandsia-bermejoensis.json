    "intro": "Tillandsia bermejoensis, commonly known as the Bermejo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has strap-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps to collect moisture from the humid air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
