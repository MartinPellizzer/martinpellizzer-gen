It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
