    "intro": "Trigonella besseriana f. remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered fenugreek, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the fenugreek plant. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are ovate and hairy. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or wetlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare botanical species with ecological significance in its native habitats."
