    "intro": "Tainia caterva, commonly known as the common tainia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Tainia caterva thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
