    "intro": "Tubella arbuscula, commonly known as the tree-like moss, is a species of moss that exhibits a distinctive branching structure resembling a small tree. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leafy shoots that form a compact, upright canopy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, stalked stems and release spores when mature. Tubella arbuscula plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats."
