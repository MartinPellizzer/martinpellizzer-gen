    "intro": "Theodorovia karakuschensis, commonly known as the Karakush Mountains lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a tall, slender stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
