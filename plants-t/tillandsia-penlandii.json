    "intro": "Tillandsia penlandii, commonly known as Penland's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives in humid environments, often growing on trees or rocks without requiring soil. The plant features short, fibrous roots and possesses rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its unique adaptations, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
