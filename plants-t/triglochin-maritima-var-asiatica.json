    "intro": "Triglochin maritima var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian sea arrowgrass, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Asia. It typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, thriving in marshy environments along shorelines. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in tidal zones. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
