    "intro": "Terebinthus simaruba, commonly known as the cuban terebinth, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and limestone soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
