It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Talinum lingulatum is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild, spinach-like flavor and are rich in nutrients. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is typically grown in well-drained soils."
