    "intro": "Tragopogon \u00d7 neohybridus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Tragopogon dubius and Tragopogon porrifolius. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, tufted flowering head. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Tragopogon \u00d7 neohybridus is an example of rapid evolutionary change through hybridization, showcasing the dynamic nature of plant speciation."
