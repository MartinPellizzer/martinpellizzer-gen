    "intro": "Tessaria borealis, commonly known as the northern tessaria, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, clustered in umbels, and bloom during the short summer season. Tessaria borealis plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing food for herbivores and supporting pollinator populations."
