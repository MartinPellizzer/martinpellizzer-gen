    "intro": "Taraxacum atrolivaceum, commonly known as the dark green dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, lanceolate leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere known as a pappus, which is dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often mistaken for common dandelions but is distinguished by its darker foliage and unique floral structure."
