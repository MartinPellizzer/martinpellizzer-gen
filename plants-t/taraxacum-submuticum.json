    "intro": "Taraxacum submuticum, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats."
