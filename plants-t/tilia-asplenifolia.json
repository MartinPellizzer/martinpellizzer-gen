    "intro": "Tilia asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, lobed leaves that resemble those of ferns, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is relatively slow-growing."
