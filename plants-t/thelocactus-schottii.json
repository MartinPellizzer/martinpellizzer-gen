    "intro": "Thelocactus schottii, commonly known as the Schott's thorned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny structure. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant's unique morphology makes it a distinctive and visually appealing member of the Cactaceae family."
