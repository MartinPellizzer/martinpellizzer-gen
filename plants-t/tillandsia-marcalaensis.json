    "intro": "Tillandsia marcalaensis, commonly known as the Marcala air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited for cultivation in humid environments with bright, indirect light."
