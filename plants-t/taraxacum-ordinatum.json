    "intro": "Taraxacum ordinatum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flowering head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which mature into a distinctive spherical seed head known as a pappus. The plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
