    "intro": "Tapinanthus voltensis, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a flowering plant that exhibits unique parasitic behavior. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is native to certain regions of Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself to the roots of other plants. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a structure adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
