    "intro": "Thermopsis arenosa, commonly known as sand thermopsis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually small and pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Thermopsis arenosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
