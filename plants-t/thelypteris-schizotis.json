    "intro": "Thelypteris schizotis, commonly known as the split-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris schizotis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticultural settings."
