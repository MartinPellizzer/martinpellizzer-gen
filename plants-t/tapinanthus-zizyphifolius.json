    "intro": "Tapinanthus zizyphifolius, commonly known as the red-root dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds. It typically parasitizes legumes and other shrubs, often causing reduced growth in its host. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
