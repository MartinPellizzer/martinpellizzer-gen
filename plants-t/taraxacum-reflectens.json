    "intro": "Taraxacum reflectens, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that blooms in the spring, followed by a white, fluffy seed head. Native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
