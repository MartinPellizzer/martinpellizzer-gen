    "intro": "Thelypteris polyphlebia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland areas. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
