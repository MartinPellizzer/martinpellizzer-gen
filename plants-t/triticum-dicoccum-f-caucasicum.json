    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum f. caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian spelt, is a wild relative of modern wheat with a rich genetic diversity. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, hardy grains that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including those that are less fertile. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces spikelets that contain multiple florets. This species is valued for its potential in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience and nutritional content."
