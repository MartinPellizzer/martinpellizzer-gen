It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The lichen has a distinct white or pale band around its margins, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
