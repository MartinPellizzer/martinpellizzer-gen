    "intro": "Tanacetum hololeucum, commonly known as the white tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. The plant contains volatile oils and has been historically used in herbal medicine, though it is toxic in large quantities. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in garden settings for its delicate appearance."
