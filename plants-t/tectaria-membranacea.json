    "intro": "Tectaria membranacea, commonly known as the membranous tectaria, is a fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
