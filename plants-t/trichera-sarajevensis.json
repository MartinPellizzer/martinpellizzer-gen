    "intro": "Trichera sarajevensis, commonly known as the Sarajevo trichera, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balkans. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
