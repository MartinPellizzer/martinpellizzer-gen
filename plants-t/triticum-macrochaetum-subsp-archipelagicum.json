    "intro": "Triticum macrochaetum subsp. archipelagicum, commonly known as the Philippine wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are clustered in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing several florets. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic value for wheat improvement."
