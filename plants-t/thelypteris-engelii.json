    "intro": "Thelypteris engelii, commonly known as the Engel's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often glossy and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern. Thelypteris engelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens for its attractive foliage."
