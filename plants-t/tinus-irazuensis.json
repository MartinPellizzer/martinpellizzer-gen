    "intro": "Tinus irazuensis, commonly known as the Ir\u00e1uzo tinus, is a unique plant species native to the highlands of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
