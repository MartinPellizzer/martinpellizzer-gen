    "intro": "Thymus caespititius, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny pink or violet flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ability to spread via stolons contribute to its popularity in horticulture."
