    "intro": "Thelypteris pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris pittieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
