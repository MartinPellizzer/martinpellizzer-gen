    "intro": "Thymus carstiensis, commonly known as Carstens' thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant leaves that are rich in essential oils, contributing to its aromatic properties. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the summer months. Thymus carstiensis is valued for its medicinal and culinary uses, similar to other thyme species."
