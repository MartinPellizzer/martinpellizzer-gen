    "intro": "Triticum hamosum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, brown grains that are not typically cultivated for food. Despite its lack of agricultural use, it plays a role in ecological systems and has been studied for its genetic potential in breeding programs."
