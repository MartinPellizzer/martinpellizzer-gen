    "intro": "Turritis patula, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant is a vine that can climb using its tendrils, often growing along fences or trellises. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers open in the early morning and close by midday. Turritis patula is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
