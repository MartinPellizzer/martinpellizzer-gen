    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. ischkaschimicum, commonly known as the Ischkaschim mountain wheat, is a rare and lesser-known variety of wheat native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spherical grain heads and small, hard grains that are adapted to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a short growing season, which contributes to its limited distribution. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying plant resilience in extreme climates."
