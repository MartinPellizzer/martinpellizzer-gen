    "intro": "Thelypteris diversivenosa, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often exhibit a variety of shapes and sizes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil. The leaves are usually bioluminescent and emit a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
