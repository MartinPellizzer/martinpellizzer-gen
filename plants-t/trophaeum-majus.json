    "intro": "Trophaeum majus, commonly known as the giant lily, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species in the study of high-altitude botany."
