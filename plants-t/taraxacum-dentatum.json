    "intro": "Taraxacum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are typically hairy and covered in white pubescence. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive white, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Native to North America, it thrives in a variety of habitats including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
