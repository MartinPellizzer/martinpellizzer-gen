    "intro": "Thelypteris paucinervata, commonly known as the few-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinct, shield-like shape. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a reduced number of veins, contributing to its common name. Thelypteris paucinervata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
