    "intro": "Thuja canadensis, commonly known as eastern arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its flat, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs along the shoots. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Thuja canadensis typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in landscaping for its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to tolerate urban conditions."
