    "intro": "Trematolobelia macrostachys var. ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trematolobelia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
