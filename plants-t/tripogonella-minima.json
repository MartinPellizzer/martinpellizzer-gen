    "intro": "Tripogonella minima, commonly known as the lesser sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, storing water in its succulent tissues. It often thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is found in regions such as the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
