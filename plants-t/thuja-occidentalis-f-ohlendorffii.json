    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. ohlendorffii, commonly known as the Ohlendorff's arborvitae, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban conditions. This form is often used as a hedge or foundation plant due to its upright growth habit and resistance to pests and diseases."
