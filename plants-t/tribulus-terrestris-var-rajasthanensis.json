    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. rajasthanensis, commonly known as the Indian goji or puncture vine, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of India. It is a low-growing annual herb with prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, ovate leaflets, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. This variant is particularly adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
