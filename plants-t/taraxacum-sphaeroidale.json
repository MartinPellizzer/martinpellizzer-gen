It is characterized by its spherical, fleshy, yellowish-orange flower head, which is surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a hollow, stemless flower stalk. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
