    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. pachydermus, commonly known as thick-leaved thyme, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are typically broader and thicker than those of the typical thyme species. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and hardiness, often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
