    "intro": "Triticum arenarium, commonly known as sand wheat, is a species of grass that is primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is a small annual plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture availability. Its seeds are often used as a food source for small animals and birds. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
