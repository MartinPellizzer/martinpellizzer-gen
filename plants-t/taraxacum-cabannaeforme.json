    "intro": "Taraxacum cabannaeforme, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a hollow, ribbed stem and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in meadows and mountain slopes."
