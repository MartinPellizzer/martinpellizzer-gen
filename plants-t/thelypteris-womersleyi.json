    "intro": "Thelypteris womersleyi, commonly known as the Womersley's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Thelypteris womersleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
