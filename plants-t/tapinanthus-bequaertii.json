    "intro": "Tapinanthus bequaertii, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from host plants. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant has a distinctive appearance with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It lacks true leaves and instead uses its roots to attach to and absorb nutrients from its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing both the host plants and the surrounding flora."
