It features delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that create a lush, green appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are arranged in upright, branched inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Thalictrum simplex var. gracile is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and subtle floral display."
