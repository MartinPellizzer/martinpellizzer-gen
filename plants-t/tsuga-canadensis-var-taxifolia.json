    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis var. taxifolia, commonly known as the white spruce, is a variant of the Canada spruce found primarily in the northern regions of North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically whitish underneath. The cones are small, cylindrical, and typically hang downward, containing two to three seeds. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and commercial purposes."
