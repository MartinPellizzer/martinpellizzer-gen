    "intro": "Tillandsia adpressa var. typica, commonly known as the compact air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
