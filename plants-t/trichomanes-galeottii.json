    "intro": "Trichomanes galeottii, commonly known as the rock horkle, is a member of the water fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and woodland areas. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a specialized indusium. Trichomanes galeottii is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy and resilient species."
