    "intro": "Trichomanes venustulum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along streams. The plant has a rosette-shaped frond that is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Trichomanes venustulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
