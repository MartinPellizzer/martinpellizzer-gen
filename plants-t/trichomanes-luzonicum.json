It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes luzonicum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
