    "intro": "Torresia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a large, ancient plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its massive, fern-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
