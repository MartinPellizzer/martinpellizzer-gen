    "intro": "Terminalia crassifolia, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and produces small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. Terminalia crassifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
