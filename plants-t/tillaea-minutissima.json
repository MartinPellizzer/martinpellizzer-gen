    "intro": "Tillaea minutissima, commonly known as the miniature tillaea, is a small, mat-forming succulent native to the rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It has tiny, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient member of coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
