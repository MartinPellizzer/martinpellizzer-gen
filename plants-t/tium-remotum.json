    "intro": "Tium remotum, commonly known as the remote tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Tium remotum is known for its unique ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, which helps it survive in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
