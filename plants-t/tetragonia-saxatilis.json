    "intro": "Tetragonia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock purslane, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, prostrate stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy species often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
