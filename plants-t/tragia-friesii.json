    "intro": "Tragia friesii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Tragia friesii is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
