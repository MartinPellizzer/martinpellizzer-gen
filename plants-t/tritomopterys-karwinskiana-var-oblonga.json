    "intro": "Tritomopterys karwinskiana var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its semi-parasitic nature, deriving some nutrients from its host tree while performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lanceolate to oblong-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and red berries, which are important for seed dispersal by birds. Due to its ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
