    "intro": "Tillandsia gerdae, commonly known as the Guatemalan air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
