    "intro": "Tilia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically rounded and have a smooth margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Tilia rotundifolia is often found in moist, fertile soils along stream banks and in woodlands."
