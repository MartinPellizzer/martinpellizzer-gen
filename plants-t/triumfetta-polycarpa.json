It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, clustered fruits that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas.
