    "intro": "Turraea producta, commonly known as the African snowball, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually hairless. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in warmer climates."
