    "intro": "Tridax hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's tridax, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are opposite and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in clusters. Tridax hintoniorum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
