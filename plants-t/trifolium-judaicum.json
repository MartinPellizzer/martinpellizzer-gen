    "intro": "Trifolium judaicum, commonly known as the Judean clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Israel and the Middle East, it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
