    "intro": "Tradescantia brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. The plant produces clusters of small, three-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
