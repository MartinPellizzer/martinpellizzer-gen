    "intro": "Tetrameranthus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited tetrameranthus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptical in shape. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that contains numerous seeds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
