    "intro": "Thelypteris siamensis, commonly known as the Siam holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. Thelypteris siamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
