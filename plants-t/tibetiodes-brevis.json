    "intro": "Tibetiodes brevis, commonly known as the short Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,500 meters. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, and it blooms during the short growing season of the alpine environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
