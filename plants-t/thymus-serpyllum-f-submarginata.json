    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. submarginata, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated edge, giving it the \"submarginata\" designation, which refers to the margins of the leaves. The plant produces small pink or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications."
