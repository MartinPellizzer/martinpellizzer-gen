    "intro": "Tawaia, commonly known as the New Zealand white pine, is a coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the genus Phyllocladus and is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The tree grows in a variety of forest types, including coastal and mountainous regions, and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its cones are small and typically contain two seeds, and it plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native habitat. The wood of the tawaia is lightweight and has been historically used by M\u0101ori for various purposes."
