    "intro": "Thelycrania microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited thelycrania, is a member of the Ericaceae family, typically found in the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub that produces small, bell-shaped flowers, often with a distinctive pink or purple hue. The plant's leaves are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dense arrangement along the stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thelycrania microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
