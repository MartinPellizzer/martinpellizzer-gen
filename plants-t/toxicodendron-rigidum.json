    "intro": "Toxicodendron rigidum, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, ridged stems that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. Its leaves are compound, with five to nine leaflets, and they turn bright red in the fall. Toxicodendron rigidum contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
