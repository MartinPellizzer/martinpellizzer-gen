    "intro": "Thelypteris acunae, commonly known as the Acuna holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris acunae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for studying fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
