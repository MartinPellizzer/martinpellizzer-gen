    "intro": "Tapinanthus ugogensis, commonly known as the Ugandan dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to East Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like growth habit. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants in forest understories. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
