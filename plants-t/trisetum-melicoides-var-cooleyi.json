It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
