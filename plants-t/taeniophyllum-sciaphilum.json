    "intro": "Taeniophyllum sciaphilum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant's leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive ghost-like appearance, giving it its common name. It is known for its unique ability to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
