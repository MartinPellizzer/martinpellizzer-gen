    "intro": "Trifolium glaucum, commonly known as the pale clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a bluish-gray underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Trifolium glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
