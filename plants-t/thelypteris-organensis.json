    "intro": "Thelypteris organensis, commonly known as the Organensis holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. Thelypteris organensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks."
