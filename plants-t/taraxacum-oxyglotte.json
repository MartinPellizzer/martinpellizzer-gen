    "intro": "Taraxacum oxyglotte, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers develop into a distinctive sphere of seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in wind dispersal. The species is noted for its adaptability and is considered a common weed in many regions."
