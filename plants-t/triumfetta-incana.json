    "intro": "Triumfetta incana, commonly known as the white goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant characterized by its hairy, often grayish-green leaves. The small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Triumfetta incana is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
