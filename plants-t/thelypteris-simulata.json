    "intro": "Thelypteris simulata, commonly known as the mimic shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris simulata is often mistaken for other similar fern species due to its subtle appearance and foliage structure."
