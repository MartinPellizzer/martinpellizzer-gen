    "intro": "Thelypteris macradenia, commonly known as the giant fern or mountain fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, making it a striking presence in its natural habitat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Polypodiales order. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
