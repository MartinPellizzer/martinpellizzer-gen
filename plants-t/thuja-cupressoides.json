    "intro": "Thuja cupressoides, commonly known as the Mediterranean cypress, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by spherical, blue-gray cones. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth rate and resilience to urban conditions, it is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
