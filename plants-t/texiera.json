It consists of several species, most notably Texiera grandiflora, which is native to Mexico and parts of Central America. These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. They typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Texiera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
