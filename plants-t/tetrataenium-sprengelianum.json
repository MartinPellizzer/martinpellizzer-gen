    "intro": "Tetrataenium sprengelianum, commonly known as the Brazilian star apple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a smooth, green trunk. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by round, green fruits with a sweet, white pulp. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit."
