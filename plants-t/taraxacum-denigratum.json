    "intro": "Taraxacum denigratum, commonly known as the black dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its seed heads produce numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among dandelions. The plant has been studied for its potential medicinal properties and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
