    "intro": "Triosteum, commonly known as the whitebeard or bluebeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous perennials, characterized by their showy, often violet or blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a rough or hairy texture, and the stems are often hairy as well. Triosteum species are native to North America, particularly the eastern and central United States, and they thrive in moist, shady environments. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental flowers and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
