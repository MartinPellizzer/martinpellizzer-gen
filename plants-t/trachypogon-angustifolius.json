    "intro": "Trachypogon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Trachypogon angustifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
