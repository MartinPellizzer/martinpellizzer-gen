    "intro": "Tetrazygia hispida var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth thornapple, is a variant of the thornapple plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, green berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The smooth texture of its foliage distinguishes it from the more hairy form of the species."
