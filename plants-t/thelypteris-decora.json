    "intro": "Thelypteris decora, commonly known as the ornate water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a refined and intricate appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soil, while its spore-bearing structures are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris decora is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate a range of wet conditions."
