    "intro": "Tragacantha triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. Tragacantha triphylla is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils."
