    "intro": "Thinopyrum gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Thinopyrum gentryi is of interest to botanists due to its potential for genetic research and its role in ecosystem stability."
