    "intro": "Taraxacum holmgrenii, commonly known as the Holmgren's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a hollow, hairless stem. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, rocky, and open habitats. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the dandelion genus, with adaptations suited to its arid environment."
