    "intro": "Taraxacum calanthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
