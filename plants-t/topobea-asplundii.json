    "intro": "Topobea asplundii, commonly known as the asplundii daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Topobea asplundii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
