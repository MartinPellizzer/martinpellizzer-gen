    "intro": "Trifolium asperulum, commonly known as hairy trefoil, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Trifolium asperulum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
