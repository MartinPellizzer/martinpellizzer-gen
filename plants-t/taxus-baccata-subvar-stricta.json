    "intro": "Taxus baccata subvar. stricta, commonly known as the European yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a conical or broad pyramidal shape, and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its bark is thick and scaly, and it is known for its longevity, with some specimens living over 2,000 years. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber and medicinal applications."
