    "intro": "Thismia clavigeroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for its nutrition. Its flowers are small, white, and highly fragrant, often resembling a ghostly appearance due to their translucent petals. Thismia clavigeroides is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, making it a symbol of botanical rarity and conservation concern."
