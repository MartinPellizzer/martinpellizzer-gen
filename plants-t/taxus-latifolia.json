    "intro": "Taxus latifolia, commonly known as the Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Taxus latifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
