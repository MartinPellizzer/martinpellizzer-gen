    "intro": "Todea africana, commonly known as the African candleplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Todea africana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
