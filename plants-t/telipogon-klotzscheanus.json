    "intro": "Telipogon klotzscheanus, commonly known as the Klotzschean orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the spring, and it produces pale yellow or greenish-white blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
