    "intro": "Taraxacum campylodes, commonly known as the bent-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that transitions into a spherical seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum campylodes is known for its yellow flowers that bloom in early spring and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
