    "intro": "Trapa astrachanica, commonly known as the Astrachan water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, with the fruit being a spiny, woody nut. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Trapa astrachanica plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
