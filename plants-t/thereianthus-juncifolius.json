    "intro": "Thereianthus juncifolius, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical regions. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming from summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged alternately along the stem, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Thereianthus juncifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
