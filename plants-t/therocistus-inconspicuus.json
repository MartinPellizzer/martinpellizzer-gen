    "intro": "Therocistus inconspicuus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in the morning and close by midday. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Therocistus inconspicuus plays an important role in desert ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
