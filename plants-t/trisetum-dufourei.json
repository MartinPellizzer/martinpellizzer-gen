    "intro": "Trisetum dufourei, commonly known as the Dufour's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Trisetum dufourei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
