    "intro": "Trigonella melilotus, commonly known as sweet clover, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, elliptical seeds that are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Trigonella melilotus is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in herbal remedies for centuries."
