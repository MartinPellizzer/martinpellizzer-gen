    "intro": "Taraxacum vulcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic dandelion, is a rare and unique species of dandelion found in volcanic soils. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to nutrient-rich, ash-laden soils resulting from volcanic activity. Its leaves are typically broad and deeply lobed, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Despite its rarity, it plays an important role in stabilizing volcanic soils and supporting local pollinators."
