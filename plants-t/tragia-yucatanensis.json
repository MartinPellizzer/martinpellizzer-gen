    "intro": "Tragia yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan burro's tail, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that give it a trailing or mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often hidden within its leafy structure. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Tragia yucatanensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
