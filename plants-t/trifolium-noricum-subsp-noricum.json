    "intro": "Trifolium noricum subsp. noricum, commonly known as the Carpathian clover, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinct white or pale yellow marking. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its role in ecological systems and as a forage plant for livestock."
