It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive spiny fruits that encase the seeds. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and the fruits develop underwater, often remaining submerged until maturity. The species is noted for its ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
