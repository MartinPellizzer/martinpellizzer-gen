    "intro": "Trismeria trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves, and its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant has a shrub-like growth habit with multiple stems and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it its common name. Trismeria trifoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly during the holiday season."
