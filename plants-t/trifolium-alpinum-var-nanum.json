    "intro": "Trifolium alpinum var. nanum, commonly known as alpine narrow-leafed clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is a valuable plant for ecological restoration and erosion control in harsh environments."
