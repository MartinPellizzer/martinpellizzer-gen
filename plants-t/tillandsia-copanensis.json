    "intro": "Tillandsia copanensis, commonly known as the Cop\u00e1n air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing water and nutrients. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
