    "intro": "Tomostylis, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its unique inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plants are native to Australia and are often found in coastal and sandy environments. Tomostylis species typically have aromatic leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their distinctive floral displays."
