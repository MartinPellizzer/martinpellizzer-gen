    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 vulgaris, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter, and its fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces small, round, brown fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties. Tilia \u00d7 vulgaris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
