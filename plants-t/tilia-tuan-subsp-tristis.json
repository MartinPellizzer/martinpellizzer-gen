    "intro": "Tilia tuan subsp. tristis, commonly known as the sad Tilia, is a lesser-known species within the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. The flowers are small, clustered, and usually white or pale yellow, producing a subtle fragrance. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
