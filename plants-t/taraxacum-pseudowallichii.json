    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudowallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas, and thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. It produces a distinctive seed head with numerous parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. Taraxacum pseudowallichii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
