    "intro": "Townsendia parryi, commonly known as Parry's bluecup, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its blue to violet flowers are small and clustered, forming a cup-like shape that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Townsendia parryi is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and sagebrush steppe."
