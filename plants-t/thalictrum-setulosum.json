    "intro": "Thalictrum setulosum, commonly known as the hairy avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, showy yellow-green flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its finely hairy stems and foliage, which give it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Thalictrum setulosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
