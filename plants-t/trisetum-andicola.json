    "intro": "Trisetum andicola, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Trisetum andicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils."
