    "intro": "Tulipa scabriscapa var. sommieri, commonly known as the Sommier's scabrous tulip, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, thriving in cool, dry conditions. Its bulbs are small and often difficult to locate beneath the soil, making propagation challenging. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its unique floral form and historical significance in botanical collections."
