    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudonivale, commonly known as the snow dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, inconspicuous flower that appears in spring. The plant produces a capsule containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in alpine and arctic environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
