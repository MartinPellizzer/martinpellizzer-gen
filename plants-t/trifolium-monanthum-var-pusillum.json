    "intro": "Trifolium monanthum var. pusillum, commonly known as the small-flowered clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets, with a dense pubescence that gives it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads, often blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
