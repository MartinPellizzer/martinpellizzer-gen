It is characterized by its unique fruit structure, which splits into three distinct chambers upon maturity. The leaves are typically alternate and have a palmate or lobed shape, varying among species. Trilocularia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their attractive foliage and flowers."
