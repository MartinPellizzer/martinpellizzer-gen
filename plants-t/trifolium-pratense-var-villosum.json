    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. villosum, commonly known as hairy red clover, is a variant of the red clover species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are trifoliate, meaning each leaf consists of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
