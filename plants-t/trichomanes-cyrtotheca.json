    "intro": "Trichomanes cyrtotheca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low-light conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Trichomanes cyrtotheca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
