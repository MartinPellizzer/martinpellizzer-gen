    "intro": "Taraxacum pratense, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower develops into a spherical seed head with feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
