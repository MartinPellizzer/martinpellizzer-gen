    "intro": "Tillandsia setacea, commonly known as the silver vane tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a silvery sheen, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Tillandsia setacea is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
