    "intro": "Triticum aegyptiacum, commonly known as Egyptian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to golden spikelets, each containing several tiny, wind-pollinated florets. It thrives in dry, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Despite its historical significance in ancient agriculture, it is not widely cultivated today for grain production."
