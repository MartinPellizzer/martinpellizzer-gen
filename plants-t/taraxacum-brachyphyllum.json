    "intro": "Taraxacum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a short, upright stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive, spherical seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showcasing its adaptability and resilience."
