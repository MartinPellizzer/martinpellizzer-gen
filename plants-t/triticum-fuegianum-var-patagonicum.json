    "intro": "Triticum fuegianum var. patagonicum, commonly known as the Patagonian wheat, is a wild grass species native to the southern regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. This variety is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and cold climates, making it resilient to extreme weather. Its seeds are typically small and hardy, which aids in its survival in nutrient-poor soils. The plant has been studied for its potential agricultural value and genetic diversity in wheat species."
