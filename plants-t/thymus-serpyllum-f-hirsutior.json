It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and aromatic properties make it both ornamental and useful in culinary and medicinal applications."
