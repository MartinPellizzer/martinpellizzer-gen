    "intro": "Tragacantha californica, commonly known as California tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It produces distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its latex-rich sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture."
