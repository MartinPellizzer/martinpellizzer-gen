    "intro": "Taraxacum ceratophorum subsp. lacerum, commonly known as the jagged dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that are distinctly lobed and have a jagged appearance. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that eventually develops into a spherical seed ball with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other dandelion species, particularly in its leaf morphology and growth habit."
