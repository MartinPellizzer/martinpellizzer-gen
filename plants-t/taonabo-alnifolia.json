    "intro": "Taonabo alnifolia, commonly known as the silver alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grayish branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Taonabo alnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
