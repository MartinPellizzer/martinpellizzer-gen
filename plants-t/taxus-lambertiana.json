It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and reddish-brown bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
