    "intro": "Trevesia palmata var. cheirantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trevesia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
