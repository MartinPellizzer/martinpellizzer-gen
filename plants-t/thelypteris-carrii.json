    "intro": "Thelypteris carrii, commonly known as the Carri's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that give the plant a distinctive, shield-like appearance."
