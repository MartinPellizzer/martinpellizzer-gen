    "intro": "Thelypteris dictyoclinoides, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into small, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
