    "intro": "Tillandsia feldhoffii, commonly known as the Feldhoff's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
