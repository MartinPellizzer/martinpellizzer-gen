    "intro": "Tillandsia palmana, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a velvety appearance. This plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are adapted to trap moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink."
