It features woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by native bees and other insects. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
