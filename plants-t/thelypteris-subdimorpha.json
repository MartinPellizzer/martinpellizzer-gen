    "intro": "Thelypteris subdimorpha, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a thick, brownish layer of roots. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically in pairs. Thelypteris subdimorpha prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
