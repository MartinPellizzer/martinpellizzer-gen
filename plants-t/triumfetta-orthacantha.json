    "intro": "Triumfetta orthacantha, commonly known as the prickly glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its rough, often thorned stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by three-winged, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture and for erosion control."
