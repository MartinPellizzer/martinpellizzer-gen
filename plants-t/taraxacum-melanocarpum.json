It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces small, dark-colored seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among dandelions. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This species is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas, showcasing its adaptability and resilience."
