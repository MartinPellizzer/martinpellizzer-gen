    "intro": "Tillandsia pruinosa, commonly known as the silver tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of pink or red, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
