    "intro": "Triumfetta macrophylla var. rothii, commonly known as the velvetleaf strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in warm climates."
