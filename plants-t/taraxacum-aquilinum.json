    "intro": "Taraxacum aquilinum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a feathery pappus, aiding in its propagation over wide areas. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Taraxacum aquilinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions at higher elevations."
