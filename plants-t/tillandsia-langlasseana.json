    "intro": "Tillandsia langlasseana, commonly known as the Langlasse's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that traps moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant's leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
