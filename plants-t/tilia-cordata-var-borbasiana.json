    "intro": "Tilia cordata var. borbasiana, commonly known as the Hungarian linden, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round nuts enclosed in a woody capsule, which are typically dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
