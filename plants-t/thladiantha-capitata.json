    "intro": "Thladiantha capitata, commonly known as the yellow-flowered morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Thladiantha capitata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
