    "intro": "Thalictrum cornuti var. stipitum, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are slender and often arise from a short rhizome, and the leaves are divided into numerous narrow segments. The flowers are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in woodland habitats."
