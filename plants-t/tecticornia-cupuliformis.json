    "intro": "Tecticornia cupuliformis, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments. The plant features wiry, spiky stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or purple, and it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils. Tecticornia cupuliformis is well adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient component of coastal and inland ecosystems."
