    "intro": "Thermopsis robusta, commonly known as yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces elongated, seed-filled pods that mature in the fall. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Thermopsis robusta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
