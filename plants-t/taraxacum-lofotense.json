    "intro": "Taraxacum lofotense, commonly known as the Lofoten dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Lofoten Islands in Norway. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a white, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat. Taraxacum lofotense is often found in open, exposed areas and is relatively rare, making it a distinctive and ecologically significant species."
