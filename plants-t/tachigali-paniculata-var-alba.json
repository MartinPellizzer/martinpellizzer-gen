    "intro": "Tachigali paniculata var. alba, commonly known as white tachigali, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in forest ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
