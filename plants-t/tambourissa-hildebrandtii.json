    "intro": "Tambourissa hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's tambourissa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers are often pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tambourissa hildebrandtii is considered a rare and endangered species."
