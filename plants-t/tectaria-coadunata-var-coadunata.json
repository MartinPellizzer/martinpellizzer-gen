    "intro": "Tectaria coadunata var. coadunata, commonly known as the Ceylon shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules."
