    "intro": "Trifolium physodes var. sclerorrhizum, commonly known as the hardroot clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically grayish-green and have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its deep, fibrous root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control in arid environments."
