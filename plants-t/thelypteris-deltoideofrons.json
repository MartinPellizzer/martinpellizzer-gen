    "intro": "Thelypteris deltoideofrons, commonly known as the deltoid frond shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, deltoid-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
