    "intro": "Tillandsia orthorhachis, commonly known as the sword air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing nutrients and water through its leaves. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia orthorhachis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant."
