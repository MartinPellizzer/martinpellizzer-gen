    "intro": "Tragia innocua, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tragia innocua is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating ailments like inflammation and skin conditions."
