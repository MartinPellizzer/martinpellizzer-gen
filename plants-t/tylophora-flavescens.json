It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Tylophora flavescens is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
