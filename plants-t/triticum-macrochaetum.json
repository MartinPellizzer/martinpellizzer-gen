    "intro": "Triticum macrochaetum, commonly known as the long-hairy wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive long, stiff bristles on the glumes and lemma, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying wild wheat species and their genetic diversity."
