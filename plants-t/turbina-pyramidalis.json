    "intro": "Turbina pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Turban Shell, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Turbinidae. It is characterized by its conical, spiral-shaped shell that is typically pale in color with a smooth, glossy surface. The shell's structure is reinforced with a thick, calcareous layer, providing protection against predators and environmental stress. This species is primarily found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, often inhabiting sandy or rocky seabeds. Its anatomy includes a well-developed muscular foot for movement and a radula for feeding on algae and detritus."
