    "intro": "Theobroma bernoullii, commonly known as the Bernoulli cocoa tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen canopy and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elliptical, woody pods that contain bitter, dark seeds used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include compound leaves and a preference for humid, shaded environments. Despite its potential, it remains a less-studied relative of the more famous Theobroma cacao."
