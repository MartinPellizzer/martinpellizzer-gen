    "intro": "Thalictrum declinatum, commonly known as the leaning meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. Thalictrum declinatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
