    "intro": "Thunia alba var. candidissima, commonly known as the white sea holly, is a striking coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-blue, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a frosty appearance. The plant produces showy, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for coastal gardens and rocky shores. The varietal name 'candidissima' refers to its exceptionally white flowers, which stand out against its bluish foliage."
