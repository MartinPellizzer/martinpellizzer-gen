    "intro": "Thelypteris thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that remain attached to the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly tissue, which helps in water retention. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name."
