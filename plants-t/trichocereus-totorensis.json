    "intro": "Trichocereus totorensis, commonly known as the Totora cactus, is a species native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white to pink flowers during the cooler months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Trichocereus totorensis is adapted to high-altitude environments with low rainfall and intense sunlight. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for rocky and arid landscapes."
