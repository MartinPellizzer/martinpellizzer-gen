    "intro": "Tithymalus guntensis, commonly known as the Guntens Wild Thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are often aromatic when crushed, contributing to its use in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
