    "intro": "Toxicodendron dissectum, commonly known as the itch leaf or poison ivy, is a shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a Y-shape, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that causes severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found along stream banks and in thickets. Due to its potent allergens, it is considered a common but dangerous weed in many regions."
