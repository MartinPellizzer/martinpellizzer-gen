    "intro": "Tripolium vulgare, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple ray flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. This plant is typically found growing along coastal areas and saline soils, demonstrating its halophytic nature. It has a low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, cylindrical seed heads. Tripolium vulgare is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
