    "intro": "Tillandsia rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboidal air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
