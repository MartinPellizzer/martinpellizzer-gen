    "intro": "Taraxacum pawlowskii, commonly known as the Pawlowski's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a single, tall, yellow flower head that blooms in the spring and early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum pawlowskii is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
