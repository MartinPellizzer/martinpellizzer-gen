    "intro": "Trixis brasiliensis var. genuina, commonly known as the Brazilian trixis, is a flowering plant native to the cerrado biome of Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the seasonal droughts of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
