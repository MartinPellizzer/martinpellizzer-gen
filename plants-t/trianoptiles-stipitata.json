    "intro": "Trianoptiles stipitata, commonly known as the clustered star-tongue, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Colombia and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence that resembles a star. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, with a distinctive, tongue-like structure that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trianoptiles stipitata is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
