    "intro": "Timonius sericanthus var. inaequisepalus, commonly known as the variable-sepaled timonius, is a lesser-known member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with four sepals of unequal size, giving it its specific epithet. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
