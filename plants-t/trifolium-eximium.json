    "intro": "Trifolium eximium, commonly known as the noble clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trifolium eximium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
