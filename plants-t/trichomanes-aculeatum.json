    "intro": "Trichomanes aculeatum, commonly known as the spiked holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for dispersal. Trichomanes aculeatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
