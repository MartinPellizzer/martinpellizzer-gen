The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are serrated and aromatic, often emitting a sharp, camphor-like scent. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to the plant's ecological role in pollination and habitat support."
