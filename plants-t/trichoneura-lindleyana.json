It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often small and delicate, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that mimic the appearance of spiders, a trait common in many orchid species. Trichoneura lindleyana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
