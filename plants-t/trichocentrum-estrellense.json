    "intro": "Trichocentrum estrellense, commonly known as the Estrellense orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Trichocentrum estrellense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
