It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its conservation status is critical due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution. Researchers are actively studying its genetic diversity to aid in its preservation and potential reintroduction efforts."
