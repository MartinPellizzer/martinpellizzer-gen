    "intro": "Tetrazygia brachycentra var. setulifera, commonly known as the woolly bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, hairy or bristly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in shrublands and open woodlands, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
