    "intro": "Teucrium melissoides, commonly known as honey-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, aromatic stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorled clusters along the stem. Its leaves are noted for their mild, mint-like fragrance, which is characteristic of the Teucrium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats."
