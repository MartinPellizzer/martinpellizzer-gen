    "intro": "Tragacantha bisulcata, commonly known as the two-ridged tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-ridged seed pods. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small leaflets. The seeds are enclosed in a hard, spiny pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
