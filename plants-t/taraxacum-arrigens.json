    "intro": "Taraxacum arrigens, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a bright yellow flower that matures into a sphere of white, feathery seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum arrigens is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
