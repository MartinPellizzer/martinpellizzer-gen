    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum proles suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant is known for its mild, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
