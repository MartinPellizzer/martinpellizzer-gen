It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Coville's clover is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
