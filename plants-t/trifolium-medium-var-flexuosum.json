    "intro": "Trifolium medium var. flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
