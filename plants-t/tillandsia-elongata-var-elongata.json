    "intro": "Tillandsia elongata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, forming a rosette structure that holds water. The plant is adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through roots. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain humidity. This variety is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
