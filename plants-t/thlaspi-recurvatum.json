It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, yellow flowers. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating called a bloom. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Thlaspi recurvatum is also known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
