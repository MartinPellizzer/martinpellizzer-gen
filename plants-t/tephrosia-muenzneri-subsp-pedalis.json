It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. This species is noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
