    "intro": "Tachigali fusca, commonly known as yellow tachigali, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and pinnately compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Tachigali fusca is often found in secondary forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential ecological benefits."
