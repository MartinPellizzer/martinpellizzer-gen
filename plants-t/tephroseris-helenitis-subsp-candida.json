    "intro": "Tephroseris helenitis subsp. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
