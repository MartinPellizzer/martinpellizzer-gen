    "intro": "Tillandsia oroyensis var. secundiflora, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is popular among collectors and enthusiasts of rare plants."
