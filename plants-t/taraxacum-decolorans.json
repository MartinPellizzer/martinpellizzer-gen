    "intro": "Taraxacum decolorans, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellowish composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal."
