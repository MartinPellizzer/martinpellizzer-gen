It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are usually bare of leaves, giving it its common name. Thalictrum nudicaule is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
