    "intro": "Thelypteris pittsfordensis, commonly known as the Pittsford fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the eastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Thelypteris pittsfordensis is characterized by its unique morphology and limited geographic range, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
