It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. Its life cycle is annual, with the plant completing its growth, flowering, and seed production within a single growing season. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across suitable environments."
