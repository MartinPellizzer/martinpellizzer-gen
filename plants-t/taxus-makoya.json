    "intro": "Taxus makoya, commonly known as the Makoya yew, is a slow-growing evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, flattened, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Taxus makoya is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, though it is rarely used due to its slow growth rate."
