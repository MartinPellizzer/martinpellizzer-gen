It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a valued plant in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
