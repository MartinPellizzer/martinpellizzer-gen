    "intro": "Tillandsia pulchella var. saxicola, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water and indirect sunlight to thrive."
