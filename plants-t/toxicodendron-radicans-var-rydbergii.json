    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. rydbergii, commonly known as the eastern poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous vine or shrub that typically grows in woodland areas and along streambanks. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with smooth or slightly notched edges. Its sap contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact. This variant is often mistaken for other similar species but can be distinguished by its leaf structure and growth habits."
