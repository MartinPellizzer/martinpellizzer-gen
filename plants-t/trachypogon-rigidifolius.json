    "intro": "Trachypogon rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, erect stems and narrow, rigid leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often hidden among the foliage. Trachypogon rigidifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
