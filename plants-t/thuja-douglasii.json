    "intro": "Thuja douglasii, commonly known as the Western red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing protection against environmental stressors. Thuja douglasii is often used in landscaping and has historical significance in indigenous cultures for its durable wood."
