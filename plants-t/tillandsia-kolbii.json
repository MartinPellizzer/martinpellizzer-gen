    "intro": "Tillandsia kolbii, commonly known as the Kolb's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, dense rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vivid orange or red flowers. Tillandsia kolbii is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires minimal care when grown in suitable conditions."
