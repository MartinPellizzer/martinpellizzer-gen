    "intro": "Taraxacum fennobalticum, commonly known as the Fennoscandian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of deeply lobed, silver-green leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flowering head. The plant produces a bright yellow composite flower that develops into a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head. It is native to northern Europe and is often found in open, moist habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
