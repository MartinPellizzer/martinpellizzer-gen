    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum subsp. eriocephalum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive dark green color. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by long, cylindrical seed pods. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
