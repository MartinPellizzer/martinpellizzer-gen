    "intro": "Tragacantha subulata, commonly known as the slender milk thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts and a distinctive, milky sap that exudes from its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that bloom in the summer months. Tragacantha subulata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
