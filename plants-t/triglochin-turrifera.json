    "intro": "Triglochin turrifera, commonly known as the spiked arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in dense clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats. Triglochin turrifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to support local biodiversity."
