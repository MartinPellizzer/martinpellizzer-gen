    "intro": "Trifolium aureum, commonly known as golden clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, making it easily identifiable. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Trifolium aureum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
