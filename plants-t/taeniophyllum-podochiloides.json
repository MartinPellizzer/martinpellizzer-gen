    "intro": "Taeniophyllum podochiloides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unusual epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves and its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, translucent pseudobulbs and long, slender roots. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the absence of true leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the canopy of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
