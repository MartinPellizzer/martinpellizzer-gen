    "intro": "Tissa salina var. involucrata, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its roots have a high salt tolerance, allowing it to thrive in coastal and saline soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
