    "intro": "Triticum spelta subsp. vavilovii, commonly known as wild barley, is a wild relative of cultivated barley that exhibits a range of genetic diversity. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous grains. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in disturbed soils, often found in fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in tough, inedible hulls, which require specialized processing for use in food or animal feed. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential for improving the resilience and yield of cultivated barley varieties."
