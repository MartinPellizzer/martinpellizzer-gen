    "intro": "Tanacetopsis urgutensis, commonly known as the Urgut mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
