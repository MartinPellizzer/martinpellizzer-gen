    "intro": "Tricholepis edmondsonii, commonly known as the Edmondson's tricholepis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The flowers are small and yellow, often clustered together in a composite head that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
