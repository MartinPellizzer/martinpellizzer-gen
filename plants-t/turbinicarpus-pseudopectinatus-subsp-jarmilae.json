    "intro": "Turbinicarpus pseudopectinatus subsp. jarmilae, commonly known as the Jarmil's turbinicarpus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, stemless cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on short, thick pedicels. Its stems are ribbed and can store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in cactus gardens."
