    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. libanicum, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a primitive wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, spikelet-like inflorescence and awned lemma, which are typical features of ancient wheat varieties. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained soils. Its grains are small and have a high protein content, making it valuable for both historical and modern agricultural research. This variety is considered an important genetic resource for breeding modern wheat varieties with improved traits."
