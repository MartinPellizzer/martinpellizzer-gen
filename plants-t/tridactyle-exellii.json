    "intro": "Tridactyle exellii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the coastal regions of South Africa, where it thrives in sandy soils and humid climates. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that blooms in late summer. Its unique morphology includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter often displaying vibrant purple or pink hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tridactyle exellii is considered a vulnerable species."
