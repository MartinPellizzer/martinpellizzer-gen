It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a rounded or conical shape, giving it a neat appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and is highly resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its small, dark green leaves remain throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, though it can tolerate some shade."
