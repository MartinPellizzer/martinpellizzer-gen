    "intro": "Taraxacum faroenseforme, commonly known as the Faroe Islands dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Faroe Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, stemless fruit with bracteate structures. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region."
