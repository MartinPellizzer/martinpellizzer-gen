    "intro": "Trapa amurensis var. komarovii, commonly known as the Amur water chestnut, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the freshwater regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a thick, waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of spiny, spherical fruits that contain edible seeds. Its roots are adapted to thrive in muddy substrates, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
