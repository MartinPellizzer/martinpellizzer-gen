    "intro": "Thelypteris ophiura, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across rocky or shaded habitats. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it prefers moist, acidic soils in woodland or rocky environments. Thelypteris ophiura is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
