    "intro": "Trifolium guestii, commonly known as the Guest's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Native to specific regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Trifolium guestii is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, contributing to soil stabilization through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
