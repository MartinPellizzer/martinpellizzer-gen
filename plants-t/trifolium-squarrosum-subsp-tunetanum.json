It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically grayish-green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
