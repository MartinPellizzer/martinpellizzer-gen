    "intro": "Tiquilia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal tiquilia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, well-drained soils. It thrives in sunny, coastal environments and is often found in dunes or along the edges of maritime forests. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to salt spray and wind exposure."
