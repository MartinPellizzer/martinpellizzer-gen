    "intro": "Tilia septemtrionalis, commonly known as the northern lime, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish in color, becoming fissured with age. The northern lime is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in woodcraft."
