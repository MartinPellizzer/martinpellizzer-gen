    "intro": "Trixis divaricata var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, branching stems covered with small, dense leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are distinctive for their auriculate (ear-shaped) base, which gives the species its common name. This hardy plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
