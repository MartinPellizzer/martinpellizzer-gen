    "intro": "Tapinanthus molleri, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to arid regions of Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has small, scale-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, often fragrant appearance. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
