    "intro": "Thelypteris callosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its densely hairy fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. Thelypteris callosa reproduces via spores and is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
