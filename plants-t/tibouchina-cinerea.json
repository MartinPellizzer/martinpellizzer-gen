    "intro": "Tibouchina cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf tibouchina, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink or red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Tibouchina cinerea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
