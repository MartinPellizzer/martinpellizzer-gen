    "intro": "Terpsichore pichinchae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian moonflower, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has a short growing season and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
