It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
