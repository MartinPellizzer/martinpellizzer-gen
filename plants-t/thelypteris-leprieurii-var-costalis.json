    "intro": "Thelypteris leprieurii var. costalis, commonly known as the costate shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a shield-shaped base and a narrow, elongated apex. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with prominent midribs and secondary veins that give it a rugged appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests or along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique structural adaptations and ecological role in humid, forested habitats."
