    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. macrorrhizum, commonly known as the greater white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a white or pale green margin. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It has a deep and extensive root system, which allows it to thrive in various soil types and conditions. This subspecies is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils due to its adaptability and ability to fix nitrogen."
