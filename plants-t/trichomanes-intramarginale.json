It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that often appear in dense, overlapping layers. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its rhizomes are short and wiry, anchoring it to its substrate while supporting its delicate fronds.
