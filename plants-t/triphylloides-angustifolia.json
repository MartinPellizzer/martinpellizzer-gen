It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in wet soils. Triphylloides angustifolia is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
