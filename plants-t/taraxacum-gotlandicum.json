    "intro": "Taraxacum gotlandicum, commonly known as Gotland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. The plant produces a single, erect, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that bears a crown of bracts. Gotland hawkweed is often found in dry meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
