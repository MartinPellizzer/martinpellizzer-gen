    "intro": "Taraxacum hamatum, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or yellow spots. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises from the center of the rosette, bearing a single flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and lawns. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
