    "intro": "Turnera subulata, commonly known as the desert candle or desert rose, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, waxy, spade-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its structure is adapted to withstand drought, with deep root systems and thick, fleshy stems. Turnera subulata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
