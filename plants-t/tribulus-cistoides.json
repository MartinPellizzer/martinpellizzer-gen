    "intro": "Tribulus cistoides, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Tribulus cistoides is also known for its medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its purported benefits in treating ailments related to the urinary and reproductive systems."
