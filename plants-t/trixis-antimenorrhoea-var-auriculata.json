    "intro": "Trixis antimenorrhoea var. auriculata, commonly known as the golden ear plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small ears, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and high temperatures. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
