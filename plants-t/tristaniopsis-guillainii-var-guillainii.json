    "intro": "Tristaniopsis guillainii var. guillainii, commonly known as the Guianan tristaniopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Guyana and Suriname. The plant is characterized by its woody structure, large, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
