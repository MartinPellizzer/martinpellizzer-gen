    "intro": "Taraxacum campoduniense, commonly known as the Campoduniense dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that develops into a white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to southern Europe, particularly Italy, this plant thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads. The plant is generally herbaceous and perennial, with a low-growing habit adapted to its arid environment."
