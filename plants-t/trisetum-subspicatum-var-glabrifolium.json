    "intro": "Trisetum subspicatum var. glabrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked spikelets. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
