    "intro": "Trachelospermum gracilipes var. liukiuense, commonly known as the Liukiu star jasmine, is a flowering vine native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and pleasant scent. This variety is closely related to other members of the Trachelospermum genus, which are known for their climbing habits and showy blooms."
