    "intro": "Tillandsia cornuta, commonly known as the horned air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically on trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia cornuta produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
