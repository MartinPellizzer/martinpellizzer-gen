    "intro": "Trixis suffruticosa, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring succulent leaves that store moisture. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Trixis suffruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
