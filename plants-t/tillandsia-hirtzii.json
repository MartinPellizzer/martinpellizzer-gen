    "intro": "Tillandsia hirtzii, commonly known as the Hirtz's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. These hairs help it absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Tillandsia hirtzii is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
