    "intro": "Tragacantha trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, sticky seed pods. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous substance used historically in medicine and as a binder in pharmaceuticals. Tragacantha trifoliata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
