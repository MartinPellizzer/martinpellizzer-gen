    "intro": "Tina gelonium, commonly known as the golden tina, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its dry environment. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and low maintenance requirements."
