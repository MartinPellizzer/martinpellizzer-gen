    "intro": "Taraxacum tiroliense, commonly known as the Austrian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, slender stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, white, spherical seed sphere with numerous fine, feathery seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
