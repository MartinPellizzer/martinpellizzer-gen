    "intro": "Telipogon alticola, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
