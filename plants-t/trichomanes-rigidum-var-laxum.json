    "intro": "Trichomanes rigidum var. laxum, commonly known as the loose fern, is a variant of the rigid holly fern. It is a small, delicate fern with slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of pinnae, giving the plant a finely divided appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is characterized by its more open and loosely arranged fronds compared to the typical form of Trichomanes rigidum."
