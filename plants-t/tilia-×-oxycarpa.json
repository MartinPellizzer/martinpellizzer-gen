It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits called samaras. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
