    "intro": "Tectaria martinicensis var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where spores are produced directly on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
