    "intro": "Teramnus micans, commonly known as the creeping teramnus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are often fragrant, followed by small, red berries. Its botanical features make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
