    "intro": "Tragacantha arequipensis var. minima, commonly known as the Arequipa tragacanth, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a viscous sap, which is used traditionally for medicinal purposes. It thrives in arid, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
