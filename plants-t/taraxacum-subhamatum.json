    "intro": "Taraxacum subhamatum, commonly known as the Himalayan dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy rosette structure. The plant features finely dissected, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, producing a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through wind-blown seeds with feathery pappi. This species is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
