It is characterized by its distinctive four-domed structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant features compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
