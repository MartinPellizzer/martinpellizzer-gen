It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces inflorescences of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Trichoglottis retusa is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
