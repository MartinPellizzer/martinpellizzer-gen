It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and spikes of violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine, whitish hairs that help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
