    "intro": "Taraxacum scolopendriforme, commonly known as the snakehead dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate to narrowly elliptic in shape. The plant produces a single, tall, sparsely hairy flower head with yellow ray florets, which develops into a distinctive, elongated, and segmented seed dispersal structure. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and easily identifiable species within the genus Taraxacum."
