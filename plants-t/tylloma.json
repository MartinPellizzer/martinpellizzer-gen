    "intro": "Tylloma, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Tylloma species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned areas. They are annual or perennial herbs that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with hairy stems and broad, velvety foliage. Some species are considered weeds, while others are used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
