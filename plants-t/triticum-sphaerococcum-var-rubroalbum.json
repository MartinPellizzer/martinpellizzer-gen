    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. rubroalbum, commonly known as the red album wheat, is a rare and specialized variety of wheat characterized by its unique botanical features. It exhibits a compact growth habit with dense, spherical spikelets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, reddish-brown grains that are distinct from typical wheat varieties. It is adapted to specific environmental conditions, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
