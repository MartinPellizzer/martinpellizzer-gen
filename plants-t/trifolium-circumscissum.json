    "intro": "Trifolium circumscissum, commonly known as the scissorleaf clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the genus Trifolium. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Trifolium circumscissum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
