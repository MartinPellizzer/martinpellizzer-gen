    "intro": "Trisetum hirtum, commonly known as hairy fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually compact and slightly drooping. Trisetum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
