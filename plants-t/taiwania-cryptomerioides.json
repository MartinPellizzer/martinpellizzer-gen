    "intro": "Taiwania cryptomerioides, commonly known as the Formosan fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces cone-shaped seed-bearing structures that mature in the second year. Its needles are flat and have a slightly serrated margin, while its bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. This species is valued for its timber and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
