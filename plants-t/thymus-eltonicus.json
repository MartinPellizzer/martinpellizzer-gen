    "intro": "Thymus eltonicus, commonly known as Elton's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It features tiny, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
