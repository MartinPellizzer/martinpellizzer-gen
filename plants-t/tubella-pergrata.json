    "intro": "Tubella pergrata, commonly known as the slender fairy lantern, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Tubella pergrata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
