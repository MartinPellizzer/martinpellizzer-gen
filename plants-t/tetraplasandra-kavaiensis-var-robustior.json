    "intro": "Tetraplasandra kavaiensis var. robustior, commonly known as the Kava kava tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and traditional uses, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for its medicinal properties."
