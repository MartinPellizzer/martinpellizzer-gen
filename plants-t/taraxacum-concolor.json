    "intro": "Taraxacum concolor, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its roots form a dense, fibrous system. It is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its yellow flowers and specific leaf structure."
