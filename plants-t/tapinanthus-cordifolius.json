    "intro": "Tapinanthus cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like structure with thread-like stems that attach to host plants. The leaves are heart-shaped and often remain hidden beneath the host's foliage. It is native to Africa and can be found growing on various host species such as Acacia and Euphorbia. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
