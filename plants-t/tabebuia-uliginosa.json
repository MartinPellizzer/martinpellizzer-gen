It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a straight trunk with smooth, greyish-brown bark and produces long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. The plant also plays an ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
