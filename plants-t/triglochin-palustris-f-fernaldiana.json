    "intro": "Triglochin palustris f. fernaldiana, commonly known as the Fernald's marsh arrowgrass, is a variant of the marsh arrowgrass native to wetland environments in North America. This plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
