    "intro": "Tillandsia mooreana, commonly known as the Moore's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil to grow, as it obtains water and minerals through its leaves. It produces striking inflorescences with purple or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
