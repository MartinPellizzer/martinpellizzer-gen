    "intro": "Thelypteris haenkeana, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in water retention."
