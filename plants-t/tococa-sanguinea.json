    "intro": "Tococa sanguinea, commonly known as the blood tococa, is a climbing plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, due to habitat loss, Tococa sanguinea is considered vulnerable in its natural range."
