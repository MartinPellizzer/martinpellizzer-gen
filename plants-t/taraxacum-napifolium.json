    "intro": "Taraxacum napifolium, commonly known as the Japanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces numerous seeds with parachute-like structures that are dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum napifolium is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
