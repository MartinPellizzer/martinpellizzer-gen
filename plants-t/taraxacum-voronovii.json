    "intro": "Taraxacum voronovii, commonly known as the Voronov's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the dandelion genus. It produces a distinctive seed head with white, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation. Native to the Caucasus region, this plant is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
