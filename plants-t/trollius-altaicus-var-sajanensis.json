It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow, saucer-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other Trollius species."
