    "intro": "Thelypteris reptans, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive shield-like shape, and they are often covered in fine hairs. It prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thelypteris reptans plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
