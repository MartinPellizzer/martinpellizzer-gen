    "intro": "Triticum michaelii, commonly known as Michael's wheat, is a rare and ancient species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts. Its genetic makeup may offer insights into the evolution of modern wheat species."
