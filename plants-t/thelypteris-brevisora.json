    "intro": "Thelypteris brevisora, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris brevisora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
