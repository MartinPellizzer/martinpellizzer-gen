    "intro": "Taraxacum subbracteatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. The plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
