    "intro": "Tomophyllum secundum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
