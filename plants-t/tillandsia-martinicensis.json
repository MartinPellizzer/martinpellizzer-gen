    "intro": "Tillandsia martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is native to the Caribbean, particularly Martinique and nearby islands. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking violet or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette."
