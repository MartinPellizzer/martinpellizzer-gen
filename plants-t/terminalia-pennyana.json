    "intro": "Terminalia pennyana, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. Terminalia pennyana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across its native range."
