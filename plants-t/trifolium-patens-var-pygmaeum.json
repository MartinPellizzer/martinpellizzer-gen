    "intro": "Trifolium patens var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf red clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
