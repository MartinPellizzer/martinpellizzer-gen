    "intro": "Triticum repens var. acutum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three florets per spikelet, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. This variety is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
