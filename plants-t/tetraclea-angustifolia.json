    "intro": "Tetraclea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tetraclea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
