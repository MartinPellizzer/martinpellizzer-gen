    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine false brome, is a perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
