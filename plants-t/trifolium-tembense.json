    "intro": "Trifolium tembense, commonly known as the Tembense clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Trifolium tembense is native to parts of Africa and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it an important plant for soil enrichment."
