    "intro": "Tarachia micantifrons, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has a short, upright stem with basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Tarachia micantifrons is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
