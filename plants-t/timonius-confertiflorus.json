    "intro": "Timonius confertiflorus, commonly known as the dense-flowered timonius, is a unique member of the Timonieae tribe within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers with prominent central disks. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
