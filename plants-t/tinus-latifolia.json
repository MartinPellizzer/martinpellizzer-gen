    "intro": "Tinus latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved tinus, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white powdery coating. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Tinus latifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
