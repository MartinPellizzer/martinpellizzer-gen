    "intro": "Tritoniopsis parviflora var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tritoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation efforts."
