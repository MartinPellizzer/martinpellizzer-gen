    "intro": "Tilia divaricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This species is often valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
