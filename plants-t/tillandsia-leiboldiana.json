    "intro": "Tillandsia leiboldiana, commonly known as the Leibold's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces small, colorful flowers that range from white to pink and red, often in clusters. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
