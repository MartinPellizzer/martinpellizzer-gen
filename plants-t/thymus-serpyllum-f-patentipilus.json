    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. patentipilus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it both ornamental and useful in culinary and medicinal applications."
