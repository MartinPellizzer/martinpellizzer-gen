    "intro": "Taraxacum ochrocarpum, commonly known as the yellowstar dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves, typical of the dandelion genus. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem and a spherical seed head that releases seeds with feathery parachutes. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
