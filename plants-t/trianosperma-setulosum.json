    "intro": "Trianosperma setulosum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it lacks true roots. Trianosperma setulosum is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized bladders to capture and digest prey for nutrients."
