    "intro": "Tillandsia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Due to its low maintenance and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
