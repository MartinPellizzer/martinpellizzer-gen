    "intro": "Taraxacum harbhajan-singhii, commonly known as the Harbhajan Singh's dandelion, is a rare and recently described species of the genus Taraxacum. It is characterized by its yellow composite flower head and a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves. Native to specific regions in South Asia, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and temperate climates. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through lightweight, wind-borne seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
