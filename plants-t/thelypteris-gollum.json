    "intro": "Thelypteris gollum, commonly known as the Dark Forest Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris gollum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
