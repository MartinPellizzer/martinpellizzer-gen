    "intro": "Tithymalus nicaeensis subsp. japygicus, commonly known as the Cyprus tithymalus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Cyprus. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
