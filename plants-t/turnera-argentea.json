    "intro": "Turnera argentea, commonly known as silverleaf turnera, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that reflect light. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Turnera argentea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
