    "intro": "Thelypteris standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, glossy fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Thelypteris standleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
