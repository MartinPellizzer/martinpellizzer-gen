    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. palustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils, making it a common indicator species for wetland habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in waterlogged conditions, and it is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
