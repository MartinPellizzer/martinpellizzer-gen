    "intro": "Trichomanes sanguinolentum, commonly known as the bloody maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Trichomanes sanguinolentum is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range."
