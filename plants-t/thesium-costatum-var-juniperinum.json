    "intro": "Thesium costatum var. juniperinum, commonly known as the juniper-like thesium, is a flowering plant species native to parts of southern Africa. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, and the flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in late summer to early autumn. This variety is notable for its resemblance to juniper in appearance, though it is not related to the true juniper species."
