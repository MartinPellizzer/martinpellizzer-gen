    "intro": "Tepuia multiglandulosa, commonly known as the Trinidadian star apple, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or red when mature. The plant has a dense, evergreen canopy with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in small glands. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces a fragrant, edible fruit with a sweet, sometimes acidic flavor. The plant is valued not only for its fruit but also for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
