    "intro": "Thelypteris quadriquetra, commonly known as the four-lobed shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive four-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Thelypteris quadriquetra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
