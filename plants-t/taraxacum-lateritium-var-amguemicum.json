    "intro": "Taraxacum lateritium var. amguemicum, commonly known as the Amguemic dandelion, is a rare and specialized variant of the dandelion genus. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its hairy stems and deeply lobed leaves. This plant is typically found in specific ecological niches, often in rocky or calcareous soils. Its flowers produce small, white, wind-dispersed seeds, a common trait among dandelions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
