    "intro": "Tectaria devexa var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, narrow fronds that often form a dense, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
