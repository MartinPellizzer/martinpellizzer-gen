    "intro": "Tabernaemontana biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces clusters of flowers at the ends of its branches, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
