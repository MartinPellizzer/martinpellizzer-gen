    "intro": "Tillandsia grantii, commonly known as the Grant's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, yellow, or pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
