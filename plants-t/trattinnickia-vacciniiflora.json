    "intro": "Trattinnickia vacciniiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered rock heath, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming low cushions or mats. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Trattinnickia vacciniiflora is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
