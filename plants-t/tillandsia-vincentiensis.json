    "intro": "Tillandsia vincentiensis, commonly known as Vincent's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often hidden within the foliage. Tillandsia vincentiensis requires bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive in cultivation."
