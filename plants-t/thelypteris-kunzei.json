    "intro": "Thelypteris kunzei, commonly known as the rock brake, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Thelypteris kunzei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
