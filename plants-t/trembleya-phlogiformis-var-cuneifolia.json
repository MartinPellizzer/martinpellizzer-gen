    "intro": "Trembleya phlogiformis var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed trembleya, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the humid lowlands of Central and South America, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
