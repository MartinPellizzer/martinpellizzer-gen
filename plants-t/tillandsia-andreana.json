    "intro": "Tillandsia andreana, commonly known as the Andean air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and orange. Due to its unique adaptations, it is well-suited to humid, high-altitude environments."
