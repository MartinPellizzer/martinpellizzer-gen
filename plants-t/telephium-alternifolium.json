It features alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate, with a distinctive silvery or grayish underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage texture and vibrant floral display."
