    "intro": "Tabernaemontana peduncularis, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a cut flower."
