It is characterized by its fragrant, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, jasmine-like aroma. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and a smooth texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a houseplant."
