    "intro": "Tectaria triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern found in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with three lobes. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The leaves are usually leathery and have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention in its humid habitat."
