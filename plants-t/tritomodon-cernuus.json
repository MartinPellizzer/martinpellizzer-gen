    "intro": "Tritomodon cernuus, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the main photosynthetic function is performed by the stems. Tritomodon cernuus is a carnivorous plant that uses its bladder-like traps to capture and digest small aquatic organisms."
