    "intro": "Tetraplasandra pupukeensis var. megalopoda, commonly known as the Pupukeensis Giant Sedge, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is distinguished by its large, showy inflorescences that can reach several meters in height, making it a striking feature in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
