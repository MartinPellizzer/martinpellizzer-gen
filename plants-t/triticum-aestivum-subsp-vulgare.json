    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. vulgare, commonly known as common wheat, is a cultivated species of wheat characterized by its tall, annual growth habit and its ability to produce large, dense heads of grain. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets. Its grains are rich in gluten, making it a key ingredient in bread and other wheat-based products. The subspecies is widely grown for its high yield and adaptability to various climates and soil conditions."
