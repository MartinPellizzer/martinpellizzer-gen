    "intro": "Tectaria fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, fibrous hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its rhizome is usually short and creeping, with roots that anchor it to the substrate. Tectaria fibrillosa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, contributing to the rich biodiversity of understory plant life."
