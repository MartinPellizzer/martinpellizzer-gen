    "intro": "Trifolium obscurum subsp. aequidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and grassy areas. This subspecies is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
