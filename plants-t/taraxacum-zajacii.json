    "intro": "Taraxacum zajacii, commonly known as the Zajac's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and a hairy stem. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that develops into a distinctive spherical seed head with pappus structures for wind dispersal. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of local flora and a subject of ecological study."
