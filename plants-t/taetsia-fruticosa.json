    "intro": "Taetsia fruticosa, commonly known as the common taetsia, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Taetsia fruticosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
