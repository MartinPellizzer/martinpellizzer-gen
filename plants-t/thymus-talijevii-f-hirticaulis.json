It is characterized by its low-growing, compact habit and aromatic foliage with small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces violet to pink flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as slopes and meadows.
