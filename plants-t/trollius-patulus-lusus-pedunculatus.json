    "intro": "Trollius patulus lusus pedunculatus, commonly known as the slender globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow, saucer-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with few leaves, and its flowers are borne on long, slender peduncles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
