    "intro": "Thecacoris annobonae, commonly known as the Annobon Island cactus, is a unique plant native to the island of Annob\u00f3n in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that store water, adapting to the arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Thecacoris annobonae is considered a rare and endangered species."
