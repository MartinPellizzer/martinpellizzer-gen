    "intro": "Tithonia calva var. lancifolia, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its bright orange to red tubular flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is often used in ornamental gardening and as a companion plant in agriculture due to its nitrogen-fixing properties. The varietal form, lancifolia, distinguishes itself by its more sharply pointed leaf margins compared to the typical variety."
