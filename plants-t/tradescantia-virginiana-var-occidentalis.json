    "intro": "Tradescantia virginiana var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, three-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy and adaptable ground cover. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming dense mats that help prevent erosion."
