    "intro": "Tetrarrhena tenacissima, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces distinctive red-colored inflorescences, which are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed. Tetrarrhena tenacissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
