    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudocardenasii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, stiff leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. This species is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
