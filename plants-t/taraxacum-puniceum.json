    "intro": "Taraxacum puniceum, commonly known as the pink dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright pink or purple flowers, which contrast with its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports its flower head, which eventually develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Taraxacum puniceum is a short-lived perennial, typically growing to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters."
