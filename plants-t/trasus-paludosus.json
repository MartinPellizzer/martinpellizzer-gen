    "intro": "Trasus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in areas with standing water or high humidity. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. Trasus paludosus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
