    "intro": "Taraxacum palustre subsp. crocinum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, yellow, composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via lightweight, parachute-like structures called pappi. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native wetland environments."
