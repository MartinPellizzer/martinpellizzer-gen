It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long, drooping tendrils that resemble bat wings. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers with a central spadix, which is surrounded by a showy spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Tacca lancifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
