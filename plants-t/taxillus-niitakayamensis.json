It grows on the branches of various host trees, primarily in Japan, and relies on its host for water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries, which are typically red or orange, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Taxillus niitakayamensis has a unique life cycle that involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, contributing to its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
