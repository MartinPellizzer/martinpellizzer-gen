    "intro": "Taraxacum shinanense, commonly known as the Shimanese dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed sphere, or pappus, for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for traditional herbal use."
