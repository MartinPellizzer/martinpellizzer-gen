    "intro": "Tragoselinum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf tansy, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, typical of the family, and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and gravelly areas. Tragoselinum pumilum is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal medicine. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
