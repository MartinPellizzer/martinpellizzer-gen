    "intro": "Thymus hackelianus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a distinctive, pungent scent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for both its fragrance and its ability to attract pollinators."
