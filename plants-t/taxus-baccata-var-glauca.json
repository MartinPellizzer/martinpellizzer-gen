    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous yew, is a variant of the European yew characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage. It is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. The leaves are narrow, flat, and have a waxy coating that gives them their unique coloration. It produces small, red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its striking appearance."
