    "intro": "Trichomanes belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat loss, Trichomanes belangeri is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
