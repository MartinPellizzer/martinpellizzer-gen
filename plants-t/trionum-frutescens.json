    "intro": "Trionum frutescens, commonly known as common sandmat, is a low-growing, annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features small, delicate yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy, alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Trionum frutescens is known for its ability to spread rapidly through its extensive root system and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
