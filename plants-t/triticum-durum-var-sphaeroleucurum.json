    "intro": "Triticum durum var. sphaeroleucurum, commonly known as the white wheat, is a botanical variety characterized by its unique pale coloration and compact grain structure. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for durum wheat products such as pasta and semolina. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, elongated leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and requires a significant amount of sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its distinct botanical features, it is often studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
