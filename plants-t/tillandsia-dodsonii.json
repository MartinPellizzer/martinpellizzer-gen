    "intro": "Tillandsia dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a coloration that ranges from white to pale pink. Tillandsia dodsonii is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires high air circulation and moderate light for optimal growth."
