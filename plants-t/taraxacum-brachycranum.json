    "intro": "Taraxacum brachycranum, commonly known as the short-crowned dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed head. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, a common trait among dandelions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
