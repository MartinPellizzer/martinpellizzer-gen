    "intro": "Timonius attenuatus, commonly known as the slender timonius, is a lesser-known member of the Timonieae tribe within the Asteraceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
