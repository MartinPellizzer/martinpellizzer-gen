    "intro": "Tripogon humilis, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small-headed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted clumps with short, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous and clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its resilience and ability to form dense, low-maintenance turf."
