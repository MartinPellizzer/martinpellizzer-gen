    "intro": "Taraxacum gracilium, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in supporting pollinators."
