    "intro": "Taraxacum longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stem and yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads. Native to regions of North America, it thrives in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
