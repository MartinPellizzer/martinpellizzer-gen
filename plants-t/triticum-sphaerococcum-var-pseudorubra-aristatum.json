    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. pseudorubra-aristatum, commonly known as the red spike wheat, is a rare and specialized grass species characterized by its distinctive inflorescence. It features compact, spike-like clusters of florets that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its short stature and drought-resistant traits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in specific habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
