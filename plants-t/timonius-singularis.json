    "intro": "Timonius singularis, commonly known as the singular orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, intricate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius singularis is considered a conservation concern."
