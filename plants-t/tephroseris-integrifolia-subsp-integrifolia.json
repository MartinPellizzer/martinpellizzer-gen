    "intro": "Tephroseris integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf tephroseris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth along the edges, giving it its subspecific name \"integrifolia.\" Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
