It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, often bi- or tri-lobed flowers and heart-shaped leaves. Tricalysia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are valued for their ornamental beauty. Their botanical features make them popular in horticulture, though they require specific care to thrive."
