    "intro": "Tragacantha cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous tragacanth, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland habitats. Due to its historical use in medicine and as a source of gum, it has been the subject of botanical and pharmacological interest."
