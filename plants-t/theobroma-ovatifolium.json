    "intro": "Theobroma ovatifolium, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa tree, is a member of the Sterculiaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into pods containing cocoa beans. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Theobroma ovatifolium is closely related to the Theobroma cacao tree, which is used to produce chocolate."
