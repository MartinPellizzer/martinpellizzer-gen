It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, allowing it to thrive in compact spaces. Thelypteris arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green foliage."
