    "intro": "Trollius paluster, commonly known as the marsh globeflower, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It features showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
