It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Tephroseris rupicola is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
