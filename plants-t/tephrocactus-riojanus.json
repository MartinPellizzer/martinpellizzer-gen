    "intro": "Tephrocactus riojanus, commonly known as the Rioja cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of central Mexico. It is a small, compact cactus with a globular shape and typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters. The plant features a ribbed stem covered in white, woolly spines, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, blooming in late spring or early summer. Tephrocactus riojanus is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
