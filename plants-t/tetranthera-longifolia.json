    "intro": "Tetranthera longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved tetranthera, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that are typically borne on axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that dehisces to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Tetranthera longifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
