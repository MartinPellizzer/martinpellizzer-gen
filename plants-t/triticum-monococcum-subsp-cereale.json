    "intro": "Triticum monococcum subsp. cereale, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence with short, awned glumes. The plant produces small, pale green grains that are rich in nutrients and protein. It is a diploid species with a genome size smaller than modern wheat, contributing to its genetic simplicity. Due to its resilience and nutritional value, it is gaining interest in modern agriculture and health food markets."
