    "intro": "Taraxacum rufofructum, commonly known as the red-fruited dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a rosette of basal leaves with a hairy surface, and it features a yellow composite flower head that matures into a puffy, wind-dispersed seed head. Its fruit, or achene, is distinctive for its reddish coloration, which sets it apart from other dandelion species. The plant is adapted to thrive in temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
