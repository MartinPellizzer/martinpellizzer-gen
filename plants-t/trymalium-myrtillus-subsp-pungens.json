It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its evergreen nature and aromatic foliage make it a notable species in its native habitat. The subspecies is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture compared to other members of the Trymalium genus."
