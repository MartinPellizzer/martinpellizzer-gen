It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and small,\u9896\u679c-like seeds. This variety is closely related to spelt wheat but exhibits distinct morphological features, including a unique flowering pattern that aligns with the arrival of spring. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity and potential for use in modern agriculture and food systems. The plant is also valued for its historical and cultural associations with traditional farming practices."
