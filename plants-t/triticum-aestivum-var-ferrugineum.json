    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. ferrugineum, commonly known as red wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its reddish grain color. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and robust nutritional profile. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the seeds are enclosed in tough, husked glumes. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is often used in traditional bread-making and other cereal-based products."
