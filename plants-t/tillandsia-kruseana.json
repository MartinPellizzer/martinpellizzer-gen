    "intro": "Tillandsia kruseana, commonly known as the Kruse's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapted to its often-dry habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Tillandsia kruseana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
