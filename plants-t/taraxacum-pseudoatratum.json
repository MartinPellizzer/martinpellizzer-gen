    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoatratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed sphere. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has small, alternate leaves with a hairy surface and produces a milky sap when damaged. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
