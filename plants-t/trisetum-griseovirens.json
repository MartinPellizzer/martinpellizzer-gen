    "intro": "Trisetum griseovirens, commonly known as the gray-green wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive gray-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. Trisetum griseovirens has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
