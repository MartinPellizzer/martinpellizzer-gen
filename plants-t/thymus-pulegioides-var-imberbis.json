    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. imberbis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses, particularly for its essential oils. This variety is distinct from other thyme species due to its reduced leaf hair and compact structure."
