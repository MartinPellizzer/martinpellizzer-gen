    "intro": "Taraxacum terrestre, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus. It is a perennial plant that thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for centuries."
