    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. corsicum, commonly known as Corsican feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, golden-green foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
