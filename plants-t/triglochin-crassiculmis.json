    "intro": "Triglochin crassiculmis, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features rosettes of broad, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in its moist environment. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of white or pale green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Triglochin crassiculmis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
