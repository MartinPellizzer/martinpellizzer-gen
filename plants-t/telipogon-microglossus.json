    "intro": "Telipogon microglossus, commonly known as the small-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the undergrowth of forests. The plant features a slender stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, small flowers with a distinctive lip that is shorter than the other petals. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
