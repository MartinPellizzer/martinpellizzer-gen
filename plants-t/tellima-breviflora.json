    "intro": "Tellima breviflora, commonly known as the dwarf tellima, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant landscapes."
