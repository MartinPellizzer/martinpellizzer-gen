    "intro": "Trichocereus riomizquensis, commonly known as the Riomizquense Cereus, is a cacti species native to the Andes mountains in Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and spiny, ribbed structure, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
