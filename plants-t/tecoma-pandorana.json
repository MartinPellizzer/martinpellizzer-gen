    "intro": "Tecoma pandorana, commonly known as the pandora's trumpet, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow-orange flowers that resemble trumpets. The plant produces long, pendulous clusters of blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture. Tecoma pandorana is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
