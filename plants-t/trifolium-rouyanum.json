    "intro": "Trifolium rouyanum, commonly known as the Rouyan clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Native to certain regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Trifolium rouyanum is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
