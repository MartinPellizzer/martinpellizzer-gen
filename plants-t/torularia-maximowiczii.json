    "intro": "Torularia maximowiczii, commonly known as the yellow cup fungus, is a member of the family Onygenaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange cup-shaped fruiting bodies. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils, often in association with decaying organic matter. The fungus is saprophytic, decomposing plant material and playing a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. Its spore-bearing structures, called pycnidia, are embedded in the surface of the substrate, and the spores are released in response to environmental conditions. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants."
