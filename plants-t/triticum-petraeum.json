    "intro": "Triticum petraeum, commonly known as the rock wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wild wheat. It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance and is typically found growing in rocky or arid environments. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is considered a relic species, with limited geographic distribution and low genetic diversity. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
