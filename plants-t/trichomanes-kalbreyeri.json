    "intro": "Trichomanes kalbreyeri, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that resemble the shape of a harts-tongue, a historical heraldic symbol. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes kalbreyeri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
