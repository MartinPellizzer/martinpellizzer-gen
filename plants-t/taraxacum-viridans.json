    "intro": "Taraxacum viridans, commonly known as the green dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds with feathery pappi, aiding in its wide distribution. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and roots."
