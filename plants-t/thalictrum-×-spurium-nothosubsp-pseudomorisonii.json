    "intro": "Thalictrum \u00d7 spurium nothosubsp. pseudomorisonii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow rue, is a perennial plant characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and showy, clustered flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant features wiry, arching stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that contribute to its ornamental appeal. This hybrid is valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
