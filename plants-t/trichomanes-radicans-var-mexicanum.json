    "intro": "Trichomanes radicans var. mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican walking fern, is a terrestrial fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over rocks. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates."
