    "intro": "Tapinanthus toroensis, commonly known as the Torosense dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to South America. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure. It is often found growing on the stems of other plants, particularly in humid, tropical environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host."
