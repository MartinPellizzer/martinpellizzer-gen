    "intro": "Trachytella actaea, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-pink flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, with the central cone-like structure being particularly prominent. Trachytella actaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
