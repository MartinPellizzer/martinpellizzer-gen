    "intro": "Trimeria, commonly known as the yellow daisy or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy yellow ray florets and inconspicuous central disk flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves. Trimeria species are often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by wind. The genus includes several species, such as Trimeria lutea, which is known for its vibrant yellow flowers and medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
