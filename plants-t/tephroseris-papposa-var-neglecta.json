    "intro": "Tephroseris papposa var. neglecta, commonly known as the slender tephroseris, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. This variety is characterized by its reduced floral structures and is often overlooked due to its subtle appearance."
