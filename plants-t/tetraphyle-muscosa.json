The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Tetraphyle muscosa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in low-lying areas with high humidity."
