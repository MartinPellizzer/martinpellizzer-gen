    "intro": "Taraxacum oxyrhinum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, parachute-like seeds. It is native to Europe but has been naturalized in many parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and meadows. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and detoxifying effects."
