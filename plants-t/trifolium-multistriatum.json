    "intro": "Trifolium multistriatum, commonly known as the multistriate clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale green stripe running along their midrib. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in pollination and soil nitrogen fixation. The plant is often used as a forage crop and in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
