    "intro": "Thalictrum elatum var. virens, commonly known as the green meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a pale green hue, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate, yellow-green flowers that are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
