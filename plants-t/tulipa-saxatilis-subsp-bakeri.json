    "intro": "Tulipa saxatilis subsp. bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's rock tulip, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring. It is a perennial herb that is well adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
