    "intro": "Tillandsia carrierei, commonly known as the Carri\u00e8re's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vivid purple or red flowers. Tillandsia carrierei is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
