    "intro": "Thismia arachnites, commonly known as the spider Thismia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces unique, small, white flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. It lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that serve photosynthetic functions. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations for survival in humid, shaded environments."
