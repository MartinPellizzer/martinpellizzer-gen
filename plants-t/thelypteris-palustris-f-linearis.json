    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris f. linearis, commonly known as the slender field fern, is a fern species characterized by its narrow, linear fronds. It is native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across the ground. Its fronds are typically elongated and have a delicate, feathery appearance. This fern is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
