    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum var. microcephalum, commonly known as the small-headed bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and rounded, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the legume family, Fabaceae, with potential ecological roles in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
