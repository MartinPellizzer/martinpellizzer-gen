    "intro": "Tunilla albisaetacens, commonly known as the silver-haired fern, is a species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Tunilla albisaetacens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
