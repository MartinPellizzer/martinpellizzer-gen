    "intro": "Theodorea gossypiphora, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fibrous bark and soft, fluffy seed pods are notable botanical features. Theodorea gossypiphora is often found growing near water sources, such as rivers and wetlands, due to its preference for moist soils."
