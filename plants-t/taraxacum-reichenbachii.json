    "intro": "Taraxacum reichenbachii, commonly known as the Reichenbach's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows the seeds to be carried by the wind. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is similar to other dandelions but can be distinguished by specific leaf and flower characteristics."
