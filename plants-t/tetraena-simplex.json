    "intro": "Tetraena simplex, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Tetraena simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
