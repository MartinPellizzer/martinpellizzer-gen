    "intro": "Thouinia adenophora, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Thouinia adenophora is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
