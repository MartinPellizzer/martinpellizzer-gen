    "intro": "Tillandsia pumila, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a small bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia pumila is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when grown in the right conditions."
