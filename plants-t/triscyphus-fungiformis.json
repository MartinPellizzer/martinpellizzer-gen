    "intro": "Triscyphus fungiformis, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, inflated bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it can efficiently capture prey. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
