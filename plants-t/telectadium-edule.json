    "intro": "Telectadium edule, commonly known as the edible ghost plant, is a unique species characterized by its bioluminescent properties. It belongs to the family Telectadiaceae and is native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its translucent, leaf-like structures that emit a faint blue glow at night. These structures are composed of specialized cells containing luciferin and luciferase, which facilitate light production. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish."
