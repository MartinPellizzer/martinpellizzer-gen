    "intro": "Tillandsia hospitalis, commonly known as the air plant or Spanish moss, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has dense, fibrous roots that help it attach to surfaces and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, forming a rosette that traps water and nutrients. Tillandsia hospitalis is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments."
