    "intro": "Triteleia patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Andes of Argentina and Chile. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs that help it survive in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its striking appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
