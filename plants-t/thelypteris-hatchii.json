    "intro": "Thelypteris hatchii, commonly known as the Hatch's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium. Thelypteris hatchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
