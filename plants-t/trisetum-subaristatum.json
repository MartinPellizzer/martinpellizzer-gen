    "intro": "Trisetum subaristatum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, elongated flower clusters. Trisetum subaristatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
