    "intro": "Tragacantha semenovii, commonly known as the Afghan tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a gum resin, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and industry. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
