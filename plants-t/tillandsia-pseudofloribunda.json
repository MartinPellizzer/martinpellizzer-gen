    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudofloribunda, commonly known as the showy air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features rosette-shaped foliage with pointed, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, appearing in shades of white, yellow, or red. Tillandsia pseudofloribunda is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal care when cultivated."
