    "intro": "Trifolium longipes var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Nevada. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
