    "intro": "Thelypteris omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Thelypteris omeiensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
