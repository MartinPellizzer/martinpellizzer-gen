    "intro": "Thalictrum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in moist meadows and stream banks. Thalictrum densiflorum is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
