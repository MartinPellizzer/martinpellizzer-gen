It belongs to the family Tripterellaceae and is characterized by its small, green leaves and distinctive, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds.
