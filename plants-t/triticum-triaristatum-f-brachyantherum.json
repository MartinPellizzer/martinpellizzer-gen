    "intro": "Triticum triaristatum f. brachyantherum, commonly known as the short-anther wheatgrass, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique floral morphology. This form exhibits reduced anther size and a compact inflorescence compared to typical wheatgrass species. It is a polyploid plant, typically having a chromosome number that is a multiple of the basic wheat genome. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it of interest in genetic studies and plant breeding programs."
