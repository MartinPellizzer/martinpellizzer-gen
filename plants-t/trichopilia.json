    "intro": "Trichopilia, commonly known as the \"hairy stork's bill,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a stork's bill. Trichopilia species are typically found in moist, shady environments, such as woodland areas and stream banks. They produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous tiny seeds. The genus includes several species, with Trichopilia tetrandra being one of the most well-known."
