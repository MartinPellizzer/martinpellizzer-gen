    "intro": "Telinaria biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered telinaria, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, Telinaria biflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
