    "intro": "Triticum phoenicoides, commonly known as the golden wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a ground cover. Triticum phoenicoides is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
