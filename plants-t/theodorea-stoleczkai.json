    "intro": "Theodorea stoleczkai, commonly known as the Stoleczki's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Theodorea stoleczkai is considered a vulnerable species."
