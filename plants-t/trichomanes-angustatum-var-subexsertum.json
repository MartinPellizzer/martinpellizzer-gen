    "intro": "Trichomanes angustatum var. subexsertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are often clustered in a rosette. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock faces or in crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, tongue-like shape. This variety is notable for its small, inconspicuous sporangia that are borne on the underside of the fronds."
