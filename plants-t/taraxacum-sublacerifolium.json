    "intro": "Taraxacum sublacerifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous lightweight, parachute-like seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Taraxacum sublacerifolium is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
