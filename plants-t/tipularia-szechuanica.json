    "intro": "Tipularia szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan tipularia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, which includes a wide variety of orchids. The plant is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the orchid family."
