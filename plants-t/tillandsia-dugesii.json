    "intro": "Tillandsia dugesii, commonly known as the Dug\u00e9s air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white or purple flower spikes that can reach several inches in height. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
