    "intro": "Thelypteris mollissima var. truncata, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a varietal form of the common shield fern. It is a perennial, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. The plant features delicate, pinnately compound fronds with a soft, velvety texture on the underside. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce abundant spores, contributing to its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
