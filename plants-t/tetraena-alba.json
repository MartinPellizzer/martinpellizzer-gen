    "intro": "Tetraena alba, commonly known as the white tetraena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Tetraena alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in coastal landscaping due to its drought tolerance."
