    "intro": "Tapinanthus heteromorphus subsp. dichrous, commonly known as the two-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and has a highly branched, thread-like stem that allows it to cling to its host. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its dimorphic leaves, which are either scale-like or leaf-like depending on their position. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to infest a variety of host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
