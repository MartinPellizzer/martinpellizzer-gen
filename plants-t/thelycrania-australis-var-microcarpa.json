It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences.

This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
