    "intro": "Tillandsia lilacina, commonly known as the Purple Air Plant, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple-pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
