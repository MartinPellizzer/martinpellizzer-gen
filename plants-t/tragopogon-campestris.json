    "intro": "Tragopogon campestris, commonly known as the common goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, leafy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a unique seed head that resembles a beard, which is why it earned its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Tragopogon campestris is also known for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
