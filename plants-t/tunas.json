    "intro": "Tunas, commonly known as a group of saltwater fish, are not plants and therefore do not have botanical aspects. They are marine fish belonging to the family Scombridae, characterized by their streamlined bodies and high oil content. While they are often confused with plants due to their name, tunas are fully aquatic and lack any botanical features. They are widely consumed as food and are known for their high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Their biological classification and ecological role are distinct from that of plants."
