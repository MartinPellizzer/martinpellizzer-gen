    "intro": "Trifolium roussaeanum subsp. dichroanthum, commonly known as the two-colored clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, typically with a distinctive two-toned appearance on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
