    "intro": "Theodorea glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular theodorea, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are often covered in small, glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance, possibly as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Theodorea glanduligera is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological adaptations."
