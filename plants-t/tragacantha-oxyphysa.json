    "intro": "Tragacantha oxyphysa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pods containing seeds. It is valued for its ability to thrive in dry conditions and for the resin it secretes, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
