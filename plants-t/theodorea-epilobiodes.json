It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive silver-gray bark, which contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Theodorea epilobiodes is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
