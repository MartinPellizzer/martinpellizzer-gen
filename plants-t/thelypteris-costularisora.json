    "intro": "Thelypteris costularisora, commonly known as the narrow-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
