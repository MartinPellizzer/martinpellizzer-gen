    "intro": "Taraxacum stereodiforme, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, elongated stem that bears a large, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in dry, sunny habitats. Its flowers produce achene fruits with pappus structures, facilitating wind dispersal of its seeds. The species is often found in rocky or disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, adaptable plant."
