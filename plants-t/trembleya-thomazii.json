    "intro": "Trembleya thomazii, commonly known as the Brazilian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid, shaded understory of tropical forests. Its floral structure includes a distinctive labellum that plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Trembleya thomazii is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
