    "intro": "[WRONG START] Terinthodia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to brownish thallus with a distinctive, broad ovate shape. The plant has a complex structure with upper and lower cortical layers, and its surface is often covered with tiny, rounded lobes. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests. This lichen plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms."
