    "intro": "Tovaria sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf tovaria, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stem and attach directly to the stem. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Tovaria sessilifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
