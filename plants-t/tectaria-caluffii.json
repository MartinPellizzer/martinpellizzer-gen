    "intro": "Tectaria caluffii, commonly known as the giant tectaria, is a large fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its massive, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of over two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the understory of tropical forests."
