    "intro": "Tillandsia selloana, commonly known as the Selloan air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a dense covering of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
