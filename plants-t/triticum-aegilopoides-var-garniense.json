    "intro": "Triticum aegilopoides var. garniense, commonly known as the Garni wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. This species is of interest in plant breeding due to its potential genetic contributions to cultivated wheat varieties."
