    "intro": "Tillandsia guerreroensis, commonly known as the Guerrero air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
