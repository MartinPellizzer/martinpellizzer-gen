It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, thriving in rocky and limestone-rich environments. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, camphor-like scent, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer.
