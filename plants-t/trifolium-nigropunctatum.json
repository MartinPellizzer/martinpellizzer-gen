    "intro": "Trifolium nigropunctatum, commonly known as black-punctured clover, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets with dark, almost black, punctate markings. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to certain regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Trifolium nigropunctatum is often found in meadows and along stream banks, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
