    "intro": "Taraxacum declivicola, commonly known as the slope dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found on slopes and ridges. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
