    "intro": "Trithuria fitzgeraldii, commonly known as the Fitzgerald's waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands. It plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
