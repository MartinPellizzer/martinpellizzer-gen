    "intro": "Tococa stephanotricha, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces elongated, woody pods that contain the edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically pollinated by insects, while its fruits rely on animals for seed dispersal. The plant plays a significant ecological role in the rainforest and is also economically important for its valuable nut crop."
