    "intro": "Trichocoryne, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Trichocoryne species typically have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread and form compact rosettes. They thrive in well-drained soil and require indirect light to prevent leaf scorching. The genus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
