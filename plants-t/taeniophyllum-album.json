    "intro": "Taeniophyllum album, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leaf-like stems and small, pale white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a unique example of a leafless orchid. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
