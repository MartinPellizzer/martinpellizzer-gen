    "intro": "Taxus cuspidata var. compacta, commonly known as the Japanese yew or compact Japanese yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with a compact, rounded form that makes it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seed cones, and its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year. It is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in partial shade. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken when handling this plant."
