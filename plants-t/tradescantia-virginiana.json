    "intro": "Tradescantia virginiana, commonly known as spiderwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features strappy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a red or purple midrib. The plant produces showy, three-petaled flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in early summer. Spiderwort thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
