    "intro": "Tessenia alpina, commonly known as the alpine tessenia, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Tessenia alpina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
