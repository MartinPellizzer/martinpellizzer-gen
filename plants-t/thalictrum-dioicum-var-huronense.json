    "intro": "Thalictrum dioicum var. huronense, commonly known as Huron thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
