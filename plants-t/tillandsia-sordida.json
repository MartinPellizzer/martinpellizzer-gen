    "intro": "Tillandsia sordida, commonly known as the dirty air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
