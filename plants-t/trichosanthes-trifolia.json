    "intro": "Trichosanthes trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaf bitter melon, is a vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces yellow or green flowers that are often followed by elongated, warty fruits. The fruit is edible when mature but has a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. It is widely cultivated for its medicinal and culinary uses in traditional Chinese medicine."
