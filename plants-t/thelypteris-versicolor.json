    "intro": "Thelypteris versicolor, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a variety of colors, ranging from green to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori. Thelypteris versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
