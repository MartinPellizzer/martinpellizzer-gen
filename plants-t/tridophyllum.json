    "intro": "Tridophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its ability to absorb nutrients through its roots. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. Tridophyllum thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of trees in wetlands or swamps. Due to its specific habitat requirements and declining populations, it is considered a vulnerable species."
