    "intro": "Tessaria dodonaeifolia subsp. plucheoides, commonly known as the creeping tessaria, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The leaves are typically linear to oblanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
