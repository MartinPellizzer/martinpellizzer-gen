    "intro": "Tradescantia valida, commonly known as the spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems with lance-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically green or variegated with white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, three-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Tradescantia valida is also known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can be both ornamental and invasive in certain regions."
