    "intro": "Trichophorum dioicum, commonly known as the common cottongrass, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in wet, acidic environments such as bogs and marshes. It features a rosette of soft, silky, hair-like leaves that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, arranged in a spike at the end of its stem. Its seeds are enclosed in a three-lobed, hairy capsule that aids in wind dispersal. Trichophorum dioicum plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
