    "intro": "Thermopsis barbata var. gyirongensis, commonly known as the Gyirong yellowhead, is a perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has slender, erect stems covered with glandular hairs, and its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, linear segments. It thrives in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
