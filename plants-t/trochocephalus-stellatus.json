    "intro": "Trochocephalus stellatus, commonly known as the star-shaped liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, star-like thallus structure, which is composed of closely packed, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced on the surface of the thallus and allow for vegetative propagation. Trochocephalus stellatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
