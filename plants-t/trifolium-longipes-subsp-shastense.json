    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. shastense, commonly known as the Shasta mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green with a white or pale blue bloom. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, often in shades of white or pale blue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
