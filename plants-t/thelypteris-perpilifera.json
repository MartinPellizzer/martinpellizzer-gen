    "intro": "Thelypteris perpilifera, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris perpilifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like appearance."
