    "intro": "Triceraia tinifolia, commonly known as the three-horned fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that bear three prominent, spiny projections, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. Triceraia tinifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
