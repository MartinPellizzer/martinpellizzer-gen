    "intro": "Thelypteris vivipara, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and the production of sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance. Thelypteris vivipara plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
