    "intro": "Tecticornia mellarium, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Tecticornia mellarium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
