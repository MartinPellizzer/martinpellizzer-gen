It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate aesthetic to its appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
