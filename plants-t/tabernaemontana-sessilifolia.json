    "intro": "Tabernaemontana sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved star of Bethlehem, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its flowering stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
