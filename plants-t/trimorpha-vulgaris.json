It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Trimorpha vulgaris prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile choice for garden cultivation. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
