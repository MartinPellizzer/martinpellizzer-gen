    "intro": "Trasus pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered trasus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal despite its limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
