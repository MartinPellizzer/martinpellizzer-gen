    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. polymerum, commonly known as the showy lady's slipper, is a rare and striking variant of the white trillium. It is characterized by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical species, with a distinctive three-lobed sepal structure. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in rich, moist woodland soils. It has a unique floral morphology, featuring a prominent, hood-like structure that resembles a slipper. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
