    "intro": "Tetraria cuspidata var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tetraria, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Pilocarpaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically green to yellowish in color and has a leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides it with photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found growing on tree bark or soil in moist, shaded environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaf-like lobes compared to other varieties of Tetraria cuspidata."
