    "intro": "Taraxacum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in a variety of environmental conditions."
