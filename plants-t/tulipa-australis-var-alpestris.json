It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
