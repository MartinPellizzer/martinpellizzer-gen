    "intro": "Taraxacum hamatulum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces a single, upright stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, hairy, spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides."
