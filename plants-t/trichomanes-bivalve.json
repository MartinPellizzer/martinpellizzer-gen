    "intro": "Trichomanes bivalve, commonly known as the two-valved fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, shield-like formations on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes bivalve is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
