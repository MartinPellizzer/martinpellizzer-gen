    "intro": "Thelypteris cocos, commonly known as the coconut fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near coastal areas or in dense forests. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and its fronds are often used in traditional crafts. Thelypteris cocos is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its role in spore dispersal."
