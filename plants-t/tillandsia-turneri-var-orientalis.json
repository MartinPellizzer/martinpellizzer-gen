    "intro": "Tillandsia turneri var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is noted for its striking silver-green foliage with a velvety texture. It does not require soil, as it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. This variety is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
