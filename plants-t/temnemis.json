    "intro": "Temnemis, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their showy, often trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are typically alternate and may be simple or lobed, depending on the species. Temnemis plants are often shrubs or small trees, and they can thrive in a range of soil types as long as they receive adequate sunlight. Their botanical significance lies in their role within ecosystems and their potential use in horticulture and ornamental gardening."
