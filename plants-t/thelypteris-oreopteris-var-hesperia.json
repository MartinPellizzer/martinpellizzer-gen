    "intro": "Thelypteris oreopteris var. hesperia, commonly known as the Pacific cliff fern, is a variant of the broadleaf wood fern found primarily in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky slopes or along cliffs near the coast. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
