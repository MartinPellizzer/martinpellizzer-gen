    "intro": "Tinnea dinteri, commonly known as the Dinter's tinnea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, and its woody stems. Tinnea dinteri is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small insects."
