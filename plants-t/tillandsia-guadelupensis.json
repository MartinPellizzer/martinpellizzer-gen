    "intro": "Tillandsia guadelupensis, commonly known as the Guadeloupe air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. This epiphytic plant thrives without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its dense, fibrous root system. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with purple or red flowers, typically blooming once in its lifetime. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
