    "intro": "Trymalium minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily oaks, through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it both ecologically significant and potentially harmful to forest ecosystems."
