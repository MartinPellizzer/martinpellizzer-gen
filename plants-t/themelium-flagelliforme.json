    "intro": "Themelium flagelliforme, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its flat, ribbon-like thallus that often grows in dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of a central axis with lateral lobes. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are produced on the thallus surface. Themelium flagelliforme plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
