It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces panicles of small, golden-yellow florets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as wetlands and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable environments."
