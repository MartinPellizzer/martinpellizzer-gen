    "intro": "Tillandsia almeriae, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts and small, delicate flowers. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
