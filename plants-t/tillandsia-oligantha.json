    "intro": "Tillandsia oligantha, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Tillandsia oligantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
