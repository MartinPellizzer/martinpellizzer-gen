Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in garden settings."
