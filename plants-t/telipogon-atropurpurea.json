    "intro": "Telipogon atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it relies on specific soil conditions and limited sunlight. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor, rocky substrate in which it thrives. Due to its habitat specificity, Telipogon atropurpurea is considered endangered and is often found in protected areas."
