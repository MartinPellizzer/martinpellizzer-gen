    "intro": "Trichomanes vamana, commonly known as the dwarf moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Trichomanes vamana has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the underside of its fronds rather than flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
