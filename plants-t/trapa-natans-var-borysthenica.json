    "intro": "Trapa natans var. borysthenica, commonly known as the Eurasian watermilfoil, is a submerged aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It has whorled leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long, with a broad, flat blade and a narrow, thread-like stalk. The plant produces small, floating flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for fish and invertebrates. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, altering water ecosystems and outcompeting native vegetation."
