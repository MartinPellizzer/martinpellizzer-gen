It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, seed-like structures. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. The plant also has traditional medicinal uses in various African cultures."
