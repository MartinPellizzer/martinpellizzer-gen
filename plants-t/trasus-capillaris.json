It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
