    "intro": "Trifolium, commonly known as clover, is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. Clover species are often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and they play a vital role in nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. They produce small, pea-like flowers that can be white, pink, or purple, and they are widely used as forage crops and in landscaping."
