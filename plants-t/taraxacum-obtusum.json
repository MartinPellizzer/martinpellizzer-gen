    "intro": "Taraxacum obtusum, commonly known as the bluntleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, blunt-tipped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a white, feathery pappus for wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The species is notable for its medicinal uses and its role in supporting pollinators."
