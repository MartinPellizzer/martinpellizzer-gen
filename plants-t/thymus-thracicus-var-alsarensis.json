    "intro": "Thymus thracicus var. alsarensis, commonly known as the Alsarensis thyme, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the Balkans. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its essential oils contain thymol and other phenolic compounds, contributing to its medicinal and culinary uses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
