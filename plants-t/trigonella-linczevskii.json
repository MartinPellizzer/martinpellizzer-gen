    "intro": "Trigonella linczevskii, commonly known as the Linczevskii fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes, and the leaves are trifoliate, typical of many legumes. The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
