    "intro": "Taraxacum akranesense, commonly known as the Akranes dandelion, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Iceland. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a rosette of basal leaves that form a dense cluster around the flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
