    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. pruinosum, commonly known as the silky avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
