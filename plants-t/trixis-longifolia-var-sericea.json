It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle color contrast to its foliage. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought resistance."
