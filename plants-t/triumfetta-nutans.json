It is a small shrub or perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often hanging from the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
