    "intro": "Triticum sepium, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Triticum sepium is not cultivated for grain production but has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
