It is a tetraploid species belonging to the grass family Poaceae, and it is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which is essential for pasta production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact spikelets that bear hard, amber-colored grains. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and requires a moderate amount of rainfall for optimal growth."
