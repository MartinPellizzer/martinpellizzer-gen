    "intro": "Trifolium uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
