    "intro": "Trichilia ovata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Trichilia ovata is valued for its hard, durable wood used in furniture and construction."
