    "intro": "Triticum duriusculum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
