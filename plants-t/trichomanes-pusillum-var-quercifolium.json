    "intro": "Trichomanes pusillum var. quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaved spikemoss, is a small, evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperjiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb sufficient humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in small, cone-like structures called strobili, which are borne on the upper surfaces of the leaves. Trichomanes pusillum var. quercifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
