    "intro": "Tillandsia nizandaensis, commonly known as the Nizanda air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pink. Tillandsia nizandaensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to thrive."
