    "intro": "Thalictrum cynapiifolium, commonly known as the cowbane meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are toxic and contain compounds that have historically been used in traditional medicine. Thalictrum cynapiifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
