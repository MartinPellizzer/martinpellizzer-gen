    "intro": "Tritonia squalida, commonly known as the squalid tritonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Tritonia squalida produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
