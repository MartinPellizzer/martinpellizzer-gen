    "intro": "Tragacantha inflata, commonly known as the inflated tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive inflated seed pods. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the stems are often hairy. The inflated pods, which contain the seeds, are a notable feature and can persist on the plant for an extended period."
