    "intro": "Thunbergia oblongifolia var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous thunbergia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
