    "intro": "Typha foveolata, commonly known as narrow-leaved cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its cylindrical, brown flower spike and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and wet meadows, often forming dense colonies. The plant's rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Its structure supports a variety of wildlife, including insects, birds, and mammals. Typha foveolata plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for numerous species within its ecosystem."
