It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish wood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Due to its valuable timber, Tamia is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
