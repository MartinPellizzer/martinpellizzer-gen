    "intro": "Thelypteris japonica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to East Asia. It is a fern characterized by its leathery, ovate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
