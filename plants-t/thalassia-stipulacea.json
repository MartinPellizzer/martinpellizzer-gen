It has long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand strong water currents. The plant forms dense underwater meadows that provide critical habitat for various marine species. Its reproductive structures include both flowers and fruits, which are adapted for dispersal by water. Thalassia stipulacea plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and maintaining water quality in coastal ecosystems."
