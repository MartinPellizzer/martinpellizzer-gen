    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces a hollow, hollow-stemmed flower stalk that culminates in a composite flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant is native to Europe and has been naturalized in many parts of the world, often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It is known for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects. The plant's ability to thrive in various soil conditions makes it a common and resilient weed in temperate regions."
