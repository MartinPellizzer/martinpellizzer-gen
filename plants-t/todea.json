It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often wind-pollinated. Todea species are typically found in temperate regions and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
