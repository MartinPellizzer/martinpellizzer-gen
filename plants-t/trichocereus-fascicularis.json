    "intro": "Trichocereus fascicularis, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Peru and Bolivia. It is a columnar cactus with a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are covered in spines and have a ribbed structure typical of many cacti. The plant is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline."
