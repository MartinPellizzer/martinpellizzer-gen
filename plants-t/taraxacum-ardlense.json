    "intro": "Taraxacum ardlense, commonly known as the Ardlens dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The plant produces numerous seeds with feathery pappi, allowing for wind dispersal. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. Taraxacum ardlense is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
