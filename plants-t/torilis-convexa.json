    "intro": "Torilis convexa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, sandy soils in open areas, such as meadows and dunes. It has a short life cycle, often completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, round seed pods that release seeds when disturbed."
