It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern on their upper surface."
