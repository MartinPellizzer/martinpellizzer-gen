    "intro": "Trechonaetes bridgesii, commonly known as the Cape York rock fig, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils. The plant produces small, pale green leaves and has a unique, clustered inflorescence with small, white flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish drupe that is an important food source for native wildlife. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
