    "intro": "Trifolium simplex, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight curl at the edges. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a common sight in meadows and grassy areas. Trifolium simplex is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
