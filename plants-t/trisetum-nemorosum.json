    "intro": "Trisetum nemorosum, commonly known as the wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Trisetum nemorosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
