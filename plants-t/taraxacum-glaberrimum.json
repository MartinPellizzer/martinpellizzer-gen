    "intro": "Taraxacum glaberrimum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem with a milky sap that is often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are dispersed by wind through a parachute-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. Taraxacum glaberrimum is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient species in challenging habitats."
