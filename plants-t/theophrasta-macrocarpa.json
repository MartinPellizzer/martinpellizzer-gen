    "intro": "Theophrasta macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage in arid environments. Theophrasta macrocarpa is also notable for its ability to produce a milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine."
