    "intro": "Tupistra nutans, commonly known as the hanging ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features dense, low-growing clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Tupistra nutans is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
