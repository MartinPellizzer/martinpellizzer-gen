    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 kiharae, commonly known as Kihara's wheat, is a synthetic amphidiploid species resulting from the hybridization of Triticum aestivum and Aegilops tauschii. It possesses a genome composition of AABBRR, combining the genomes of its parent species. This plant is notable for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications. It is primarily cultivated in research settings to study gene transfer and polyploidy. Its botanical features include spikelets with glumes and lemma-like structures, typical of the Poaceae family."
