    "intro": "Thelypteris blanda, commonly known as the broadleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Thelypteris blanda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens."
