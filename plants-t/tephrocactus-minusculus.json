    "intro": "Tephrocactus minusculus, commonly known as the small desert cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a short, cylindrical stem that is typically green and covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its root system is shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall. Tephrocactus minusculus is well-suited to harsh desert conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
