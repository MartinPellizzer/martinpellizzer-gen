    "intro": "Thalictrum flavum var. pinguidum, commonly known as the yellow meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in complex, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
