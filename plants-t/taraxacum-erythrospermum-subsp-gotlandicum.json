    "intro": "Taraxacum erythrospermum subsp. gotlandicum, commonly known as Gotland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Baltic region. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower heads and a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports the flowering head, which consists of numerous small, yellow tubular flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus, typical of the Asteraceae family. This subspecies is often found in sandy or calcareous soils and is relatively rare, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
