    "intro": "Triglochin minutissima, commonly known as the lesser spike-rush, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and survive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it blooms from late summer into early autumn. Triglochin minutissima is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
