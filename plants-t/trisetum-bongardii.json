    "intro": "Trisetum bongardii, commonly known as Bongard's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental value. Trisetum bongardii is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
