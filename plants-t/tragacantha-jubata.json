    "intro": "Tragacantha jubata, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tragacantha jubata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and a long dormancy period."
