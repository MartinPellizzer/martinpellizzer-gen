    "intro": "Tragopogon pratensis subsp. lamottei, commonly known as the alpine goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads that resemble a goat's beard. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and covered with fine hairs, while the flowering stems are slender and often branched. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptation to harsh alpine conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
