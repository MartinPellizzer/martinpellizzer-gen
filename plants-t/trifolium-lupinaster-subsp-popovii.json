    "intro": "Trifolium lupinaster subsp. popovii, commonly known as the Popov's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
