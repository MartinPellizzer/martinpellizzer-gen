    "intro": "Thelypteris rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent red veins that stand out against the green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, and the fronds are usually pinnately divided with a smooth, leathery texture. Thelypteris rubrinervis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
