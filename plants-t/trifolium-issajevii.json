    "intro": "Trifolium issajevii, commonly known as the Issajev's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Trifolium issajevii is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
