    "intro": "Teucrium polium f. soloitanum, commonly known as the solitary germander, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the germander plant. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced foliage, which sets it apart from the more common forms of Teucrium polium. The plant typically features small, dark green leaves and produces delicate blue to purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
