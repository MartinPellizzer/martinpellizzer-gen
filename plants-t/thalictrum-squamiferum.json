    "intro": "Thalictrum squamiferum, commonly known as the scaly meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Thalictrum squamiferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
