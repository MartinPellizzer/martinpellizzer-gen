    "intro": "Thelypteris subappendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that are often slightly curled at the tips. The sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are located on the underside of the pinnae and are covered by a thin, membranous indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
