    "intro": "Thelypteris platyloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris platyloba thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, reflecting its ecological and cultural significance."
