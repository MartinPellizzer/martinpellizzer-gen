    "intro": "Tetraria bachmannii, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its unique thallus structure. It forms a crustose growth on rocky surfaces, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's body consists of a dark, leathery layer with a dense, interwoven network of hyphae. It lacks true leaves, stems, or roots, relying instead on photosynthesis through its symbiotic association with algae. Tetraria bachmannii is commonly found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
