    "intro": "Tillandsia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
