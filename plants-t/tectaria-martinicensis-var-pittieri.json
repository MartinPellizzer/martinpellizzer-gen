    "intro": "Tectaria martinicensis var. pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
