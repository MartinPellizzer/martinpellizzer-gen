    "intro": "Trichomanes eximium var. crispulum, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often curled or crisped at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically along stream banks or in damp forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
