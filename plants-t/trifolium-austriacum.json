    "intro": "Trifolium austriacum, commonly known as Austrian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This plant is native to Central Europe and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Trifolium austriacum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
