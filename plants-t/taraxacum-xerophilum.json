    "intro": "Taraxacum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments through deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that disperse windborne seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing limited forage for desert wildlife."
