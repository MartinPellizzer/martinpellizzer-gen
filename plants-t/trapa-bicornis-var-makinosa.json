    "intro": "Trapa bicornis var. makinosa, commonly known as the Makinosa water shield, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and stabilizing water bodies."
