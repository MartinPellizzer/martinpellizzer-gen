    "intro": "Thalictrum elatum var. flabellatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
