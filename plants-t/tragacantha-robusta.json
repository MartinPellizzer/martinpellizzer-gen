    "intro": "Tragacantha robusta, commonly known as the robust tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its sap, known as tragacanth, is a viscous gum used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Tragacantha robusta thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established."
