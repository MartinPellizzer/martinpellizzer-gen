    "intro": "Teucrium thymoides, commonly known as creeping tarragon, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are aromatic, with a scent reminiscent of thyme, and are often used in culinary applications. Teucrium thymoides thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders."
