It is characterized by its finely cut, aromatic leaves and small, yellow button-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and chrysanthemums, and is known for its medicinal properties. Tanacetum crispum is often used in herbal remedies for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and border plantings."
