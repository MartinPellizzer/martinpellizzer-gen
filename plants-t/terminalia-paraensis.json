    "intro": "Terminalia paraensis, commonly known as the Paraense Terminalia, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, simple leaves that are alternate and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. The species also plays a role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
