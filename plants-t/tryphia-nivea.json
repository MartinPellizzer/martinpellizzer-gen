    "intro": "Tryphia nivea, commonly known as the white tryphia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant has slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
