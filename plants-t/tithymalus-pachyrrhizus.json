    "intro": "Tithymalus pachyrrhizus, commonly known as the thick-root tithymalus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its robust, fleshy roots that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Tithymalus pachyrrhizus produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in dry gardens."
