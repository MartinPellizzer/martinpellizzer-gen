It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are narrow and gray-green in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
