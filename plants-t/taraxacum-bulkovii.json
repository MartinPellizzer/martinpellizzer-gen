    "intro": "Taraxacum bulkovii, commonly known as the Balkan dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces a distinctive hollow stem and a pappus-equipped seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
