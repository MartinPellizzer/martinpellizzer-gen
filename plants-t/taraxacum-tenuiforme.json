    "intro": "Taraxacum tenuiforme, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairless leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces small, white, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in open, disturbed soils. Taraxacum tenuiforme is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
