    "intro": "Trifolium commutatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium commutatum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
