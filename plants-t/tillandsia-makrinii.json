    "intro": "Tillandsia makrinii, commonly known as the Makrinii Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia makrinii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
