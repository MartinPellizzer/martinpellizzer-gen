    "intro": "Tillandsia sphaerocephala var. sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a tight, cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant produces a dense cluster of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and good air circulation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
