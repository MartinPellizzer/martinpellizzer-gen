    "intro": "Telis cephalotes, commonly known as the helmet fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, helmet-shaped spore cases. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value. The reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in dense, cap-like formations at the tips of the fronds."
