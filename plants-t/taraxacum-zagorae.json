    "intro": "Taraxacum zagorae, commonly known as the Zagora dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Balkan region, particularly found in parts of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. It thrives in rocky and open habitats, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
