    "intro": "Tetrathyrium subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tetrathyrium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive subcordate base. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Tetrathyrium subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
