    "intro": "Trichocentrum panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, slender stems and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for capturing moisture from the air. Trichocentrum panamense thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
