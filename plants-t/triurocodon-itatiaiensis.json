    "intro": "Triurocodon itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble those of primitive ferns. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky outcrops and forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, Triurocodon itatiaiensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
