It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its scientific name. It is typically found in grassy areas and is often used as a forage crop due to its nutritional value. Trifolium umbellatum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
