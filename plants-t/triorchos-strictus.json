    "intro": "Triorchos strictus, commonly known as the rigid triorchos, is a unique plant species characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often a striking shade of purple or blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Triorchos strictus is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it prefers full sun and dry conditions."
