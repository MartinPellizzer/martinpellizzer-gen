    "intro": "Trichopteryx lembaensis, commonly known as the Lembu rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, with small, showy flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its mountainous habitat. It plays an important ecological role in its ecosystem, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
