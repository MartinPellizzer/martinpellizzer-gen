    "intro": "Trifolium sclerorrhizum, commonly known as the hard-rooted clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Trifolium sclerorrhizum has a deep, fibrous root system that enables it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
