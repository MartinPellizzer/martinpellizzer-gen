    "intro": "Teclea rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' teclea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. Teclea rogersii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in various horticultural settings beyond its native habitat."
