    "intro": "Tillandsia may-patii, commonly known as the May-patii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink. It requires bright, indirect light and minimal soil, making it an ideal choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is popular among plant enthusiasts and collectors."
