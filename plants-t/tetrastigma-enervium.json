    "intro": "Tetrastigma enervium, commonly known as the climbing raisin vine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that allow it to climb and spread over other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round berries that are edible. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a reddish underside. Tetrastigma enervium is valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
