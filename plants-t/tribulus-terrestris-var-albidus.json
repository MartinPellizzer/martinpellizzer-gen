    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris var. albidus, commonly known as the white bindweed, is a flowering plant native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with thin, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically followed by red, spherical fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are usually hairy. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction."
