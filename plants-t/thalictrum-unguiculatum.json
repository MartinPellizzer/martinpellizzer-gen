    "intro": "Thalictrum unguiculatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features delicate, fern-like leaves with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Thalictrum unguiculatum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability."
