    "intro": "Thladiantha sessilifolia var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed thladiantha, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, followed by orange to red berries that are edible. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
