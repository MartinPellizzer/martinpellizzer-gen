    "intro": "Tillandsia stenoura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. Its foliage is typically narrow and grass-like, with a dense rosette structure that helps retain water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
