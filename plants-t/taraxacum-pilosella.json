    "intro": "Taraxacum pilosella, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces a hollow, wind-dispersed stem with a distinctive crown of bracts. Its bright yellow flower head consists of numerous tiny florets surrounded by a pappus of fine hairs. Taraxacum pilosella is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its resilience and widespread distribution."
