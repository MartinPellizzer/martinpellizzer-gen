    "intro": "Trachystylis, commonly known as the narrow-styled orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Trachystylis species are characterized by their compact growth habit, with short, erect stems and clustered flowers that often have a distinctive, intricate structure. The flowers typically feature three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being modified into specialized structures called labellum. These orchids thrive in shaded, moist environments and are often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops."
