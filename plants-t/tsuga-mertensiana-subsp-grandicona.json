    "intro": "Tsuga mertensiana subsp. grandicona, commonly known as the grand cone fir, is a subspecies of the white fir native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its conical shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones that are larger and more robust than those of the typical white fir. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often forming dense stands in subalpine and alpine zones. Its botanical features include a smooth, gray bark and a crown that is often dense and pyramidal. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
