    "intro": "Trifolium arvernense, commonly known as Arvernese clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Arvernese clover is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
