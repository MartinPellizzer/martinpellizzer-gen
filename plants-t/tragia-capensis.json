    "intro": "Tragia capensis, commonly known as the African tickseed or red tickseed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its branched structure and rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually red or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Tragia capensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with low rainfall. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and visually striking in its native habitat."
