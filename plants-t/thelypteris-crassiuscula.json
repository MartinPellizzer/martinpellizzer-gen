It is characterized by its leathery, broad leaves that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, delicate frond structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the ground, forming dense colonies. Thelypteris crassiuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
