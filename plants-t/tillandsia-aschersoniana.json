    "intro": "Tillandsia aschersoniana, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures, using its specialized roots to anchor itself rather than absorb nutrients from soil. The plant is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters of soft, gray-green foliage that resemble moss. It does not require soil for nourishment, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves from the air and rain. This unique adaptation allows it to flourish in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests."
