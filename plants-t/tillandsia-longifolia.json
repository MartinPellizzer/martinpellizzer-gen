    "intro": "Tillandsia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia longifolia is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
