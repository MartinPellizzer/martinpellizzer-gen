    "intro": "Tripolium conspicuum, commonly known as the showy sandspur, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with prominent bracts that give it its common name. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
