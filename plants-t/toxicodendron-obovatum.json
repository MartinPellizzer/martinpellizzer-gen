    "intro": "Toxicodendron obovatum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, obovate shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that attract birds. Toxicodendron obovatum contains urushiol, a potent irritant that can cause skin rashes and allergic reactions in many people. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
