It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged around the stem. Its sporophylls are closely clustered and bear spores on the underside, a characteristic feature of the clubmoss family. Trichomanes vitiense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
