    "intro": "Tutcheria hirta var. cordatula, commonly known as the heart-leaf tutcheria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lanceolate leaves that are often heart-shaped at the base, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
