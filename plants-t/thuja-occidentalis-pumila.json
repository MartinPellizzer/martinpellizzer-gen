    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf arborvitae, is a compact evergreen conifer native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is typically a deep green. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens."
