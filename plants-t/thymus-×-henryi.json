    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 henryi, commonly known as Henry's thyme, is a hybrid perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover. Its ornamental value and aromatic properties make it a popular choice for gardens and herbal use."
