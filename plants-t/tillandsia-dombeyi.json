    "intro": "Tillandsia dombeyi, commonly known as the Dombey's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia dombeyi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
