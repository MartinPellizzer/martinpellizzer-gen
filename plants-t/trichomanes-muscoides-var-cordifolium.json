    "intro": "Trichomanes muscoides var. cordifolium, commonly known as the heart-leaved water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of true ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its small, clustered growth habit and unique leaf morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
