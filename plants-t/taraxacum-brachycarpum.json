    "intro": "Taraxacum brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-seeded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous tiny, parachute-like seeds. This species is often considered a weed but plays a role in pollination and soil stabilization."
