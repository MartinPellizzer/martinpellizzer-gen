It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, including the Caucasus region. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. It produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed capsule known as a pappus. Taraxacum tauricum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
