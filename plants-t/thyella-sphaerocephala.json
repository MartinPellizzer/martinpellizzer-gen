    "intro": "Thyella sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe-headed thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic properties. Thyella sphaerocephala is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
