It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
