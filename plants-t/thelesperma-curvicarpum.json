    "intro": "Thelesperma curvicarpum, commonly known as narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Thelesperma curvicarpum is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
