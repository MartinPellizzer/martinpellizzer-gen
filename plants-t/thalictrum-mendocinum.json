    "intro": "Thalictrum mendocinum, commonly known as the Mendocino meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
