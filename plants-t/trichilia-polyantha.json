    "intro": "Trichilia polyantha, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by oval, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also threatened by overexploitation and habitat loss."
