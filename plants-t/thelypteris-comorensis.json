    "intro": "Thelypteris comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian water fern, is a species of fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Thelypteris comorensis plays a role in the local ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
