    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 extranea, commonly known as the European lime or small-leaved lime, is a hybrid deciduous tree belonging to the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas across Europe. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance."
