    "intro": "Trillium erectum var. horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal trillium, is a rare variant of the red trillium native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive horizontal stem that lies close to the ground, contrasting with the upright growth of the typical varietal form. The plant produces three large, waxy, white petals and three green sepals, with a prominent yellow stamen in the center. It blooms in early spring, typically between April and May, and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
