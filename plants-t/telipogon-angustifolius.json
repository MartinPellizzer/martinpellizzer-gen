    "intro": "Telipogon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to wetland habitats in South America. It is a perennial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
