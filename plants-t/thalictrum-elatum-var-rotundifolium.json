It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
