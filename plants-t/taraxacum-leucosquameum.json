    "intro": "Taraxacum leucosquameum, commonly known as the white-squamated dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces wind-dispersed seeds. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads. Its flowers typically bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. The species is notable for its distinctive white, scaly appearance on the stem and leaves, which gives it its common name."
