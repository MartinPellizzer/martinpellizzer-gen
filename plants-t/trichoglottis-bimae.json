    "intro": "Trichoglottis bimae, commonly known as the Bima trichoglottis, is a rare and unusual orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect pseudobulbs and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The flowers are typically small and greenish-white, with a unique structure that includes a short, narrow spur. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
