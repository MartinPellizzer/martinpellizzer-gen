    "intro": "Taraxacum pedrottii, commonly known as the Pedrott's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers produce achenes with pappus, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Taraxacum pedrottii is a perennial species that thrives in temperate climates."
