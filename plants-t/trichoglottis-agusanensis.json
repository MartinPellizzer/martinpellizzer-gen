    "intro": "Trichoglottis agusanensis, commonly known as the Agusan trichoglottis, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
