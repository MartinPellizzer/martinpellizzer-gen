    "intro": "Tragopyrum decipiens, commonly known as the false goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Tragopyrum decipiens is typically found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
