    "intro": "Tieghemopanax reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed sycogath, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its broad, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
