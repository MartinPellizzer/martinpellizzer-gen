    "intro": "Trichomanes caespifrons, commonly known as the cushion fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a compact, low-growing habit with dense, overlapping fronds that form a cushion-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a characteristic feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
