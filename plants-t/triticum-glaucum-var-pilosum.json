    "intro": "Triticum glaucum var. pilosum, commonly known as the woolly bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
