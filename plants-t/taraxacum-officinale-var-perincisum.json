    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale var. perincisum, commonly known as the Perincisum dandelion, is a variant of the common dandelion characterized by its distinctive botanical features. It typically has a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow flower head that develops into a white, spherical seed head known as a pappus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and roadside areas. This variant is notable for its resilience and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds."
