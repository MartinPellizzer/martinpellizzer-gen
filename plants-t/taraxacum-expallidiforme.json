    "intro": "Taraxacum expallidiforme, commonly known as the pale form dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This species is similar to other dandelions but is distinguished by its pale coloration and specific morphological features."
