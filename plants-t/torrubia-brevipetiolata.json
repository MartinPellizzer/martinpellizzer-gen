It features small, fleshy, red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
