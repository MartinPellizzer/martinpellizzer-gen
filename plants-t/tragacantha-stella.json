    "intro": "Tragacantha stella, commonly known as star tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. Tragacantha stella thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes."
