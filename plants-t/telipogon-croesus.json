    "intro": "Telipogon croesus, commonly known as the golden lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon croesus is considered a vulnerable species."
