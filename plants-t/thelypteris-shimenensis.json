    "intro": "Thelypteris shimenensis, commonly known as the Shimen holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Thelypteris shimenensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
