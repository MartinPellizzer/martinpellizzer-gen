    "intro": "Typha major, commonly known as the cattail, is a tall, herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its distinctive brown, cylindrical flower heads. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Typha major plays an important ecological role by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine and as a source of materials for crafts."
