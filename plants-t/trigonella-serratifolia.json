    "intro": "Trigonella serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a legume that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Fabaceae family. Trigonella serratifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
