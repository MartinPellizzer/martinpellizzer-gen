    "intro": "Thymus pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's thyme, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Balkans. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Thymus pavlovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and aromatic properties, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
