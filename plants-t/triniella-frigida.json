    "intro": "Triniella frigida, commonly known as the cold-hardy grass or Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to survive in permafrost and tundra conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the summer. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic animals. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in cold climates."
