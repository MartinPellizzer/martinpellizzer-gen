    "intro": "Thelypteris braithwaitei, commonly known as the Braithwaite's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris braithwaitei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
