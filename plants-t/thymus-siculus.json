    "intro": "Thymus siculus, commonly known as Sicilian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, compact form with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its foliage contains essential oils, including thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Thymus siculus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
