    "intro": "Trichomanes lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant exhibits a unique structure with sporangia located on the underside of the leaves, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Trichomanes lanceolatum is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
