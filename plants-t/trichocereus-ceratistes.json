    "intro": "Trichocereus ceratistes, commonly known as the Ceratistis Cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, a feature common among many cacti adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and unique nocturnal blooming habit, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
