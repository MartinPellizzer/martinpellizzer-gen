    "intro": "Tristania vieillardii, commonly known as the Tristania tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often leathery in texture. Tristania vieillardii is adapted to the harsh maritime climate of its native environment, with features that help it withstand strong winds and salt spray. It plays an important ecological role in the limited flora of Tristan da Cunha."
