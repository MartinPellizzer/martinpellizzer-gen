    "intro": "Trichocentrum tenuiflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a slender, erect stem with numerous clustered, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft trichomes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are typically fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Trichocentrum tenuiflorum is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
