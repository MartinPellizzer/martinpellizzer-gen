    "intro": "Thalianthus, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found along dunes and shorelines. Thalianthus has a trailing growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems, supporting local biodiversity."
