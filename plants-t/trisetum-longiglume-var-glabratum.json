    "intro": "Trisetum longiglume var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth glabrous trisetum, is a grass species characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. It typically features narrow, linear leaves that are often glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually compact and arranged in a panicle-like structure. This variety is native to certain regions of North America and thrives in moist, open habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of native grassland ecosystems and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
