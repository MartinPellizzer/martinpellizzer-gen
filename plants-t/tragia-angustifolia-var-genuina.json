    "intro": "Tragia angustifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub or subshrub with branched stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a glandular surface, contributing to its characteristic appearance. The species is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
