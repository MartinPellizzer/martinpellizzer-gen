    "intro": "Tillandsia multifolia, commonly known as the silver vane orchid, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that can store water. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia multifolia is often grown as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
