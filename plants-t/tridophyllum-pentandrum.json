    "intro": "Tridophyllum pentandrum, commonly known as the parasitic orchid, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on the roots of other plants for water and nutrients. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which prevents it from performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in association with trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually white or greenish in color, and it produces tiny, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological interactions of forest ecosystems."
