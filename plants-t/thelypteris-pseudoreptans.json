    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudoreptans, commonly known as the false chain fern, is a member of the dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a distinctive, elongated shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in which it is found."
