    "intro": "Tillandsia stricta var. caulescens, commonly known as the stiff tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and dense, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. This variety is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is adapted to grow epiphytically on trees or rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
