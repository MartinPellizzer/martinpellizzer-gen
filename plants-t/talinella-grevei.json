    "intro": "Talinella grevei, commonly known as the Cape mountain fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Talinella grevei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
