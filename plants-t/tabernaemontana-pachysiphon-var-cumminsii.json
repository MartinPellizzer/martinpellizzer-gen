    "intro": "Tabernaemontana pachysiphon var. cumminsii, commonly known as the Cummins' Madagascar ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant produces pale pink to white blooms with intricate patterns, often appearing in clusters along the stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on trees or rocks in montane forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
