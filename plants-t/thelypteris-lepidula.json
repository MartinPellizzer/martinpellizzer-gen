    "intro": "Thelypteris lepidula, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Thelypteris lepidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
