    "intro": "Thelocactus bicolor var. tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored locactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique tri-coloration, typically displaying shades of yellow, green, and red on its cylindrical stem. The plant features spiny areoles and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
