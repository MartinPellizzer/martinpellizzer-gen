It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland areas or along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
