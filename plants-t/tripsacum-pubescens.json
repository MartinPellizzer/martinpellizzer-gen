    "intro": "Tripsacum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments. Tripsacum pubescens is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a resilient forage plant in some regions."
