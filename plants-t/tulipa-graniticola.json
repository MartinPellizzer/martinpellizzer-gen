    "intro": "Tulipa graniticola, commonly known as the granitic tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. This perennial bulbous plant is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in early spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapting to the harsh, mountainous environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tulipa graniticola is considered a valuable and often endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
