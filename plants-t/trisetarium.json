    "intro": "Trisetarium, commonly known as the three-branched spikelet, is a botanical structure found in certain grasses and sedges. It consists of a central axis with three branches, each potentially bearing flowers or inflorescences. This unique arrangement is characteristic of the Poaceae (grass family) and Cyperaceae (sedge family). The trisetarium plays a role in the plant's reproductive strategy by increasing the chances of successful pollination. Its structure is often used in taxonomic identification of grass species."
