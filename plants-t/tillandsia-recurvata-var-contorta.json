    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata var. contorta, commonly known as the curly tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often twisted or curled. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its striking silver-green foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
