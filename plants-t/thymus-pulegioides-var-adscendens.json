It features dense, aromatic foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, give it a strong, pungent fragrance and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
