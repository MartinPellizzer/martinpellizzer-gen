    "intro": "Taeniophyllum collinum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes form a network that anchors it to its substrate. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
