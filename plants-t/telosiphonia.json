    "intro": "Telosiphonia, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are well-adapted to saline environments. They have succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, and their showy, five-petaled flowers are often pink or red. Telosiphonia species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The plants also play a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
