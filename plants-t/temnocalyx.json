    "intro": "Temnocalyx, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody structure and the presence of velvety hairs on its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically alternate and have a heart-shaped or ovate appearance. The flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in ecological systems."
