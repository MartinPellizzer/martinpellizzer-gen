    "intro": "Tillandsia ropalocarpa, commonly known as the silver pine tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage, and it produces white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
