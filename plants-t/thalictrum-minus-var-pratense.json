    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. pratense, commonly known as small meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear whorled, fern-like leaves with a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its finely divided foliage and subtle floral display."
