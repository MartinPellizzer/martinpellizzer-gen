    "intro": "Taeniophyllum nephrophorum, commonly known as the kidney-leaf stiltroot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are ovate to kidney-shaped, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and are arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
