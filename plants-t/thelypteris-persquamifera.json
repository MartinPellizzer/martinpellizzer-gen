    "intro": "Thelypteris persquamifera, commonly known as the squamate water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the undergrowth. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
