It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow leaves and compact spikelets. Its grains are used primarily for making semolina, which is essential in pasta and bread production. This variety is valued for its high gluten content, contributing to the elasticity and texture of baked goods."
