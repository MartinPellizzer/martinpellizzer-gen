    "intro": "Taraxacum haematicum, commonly known as the blood dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and a rosette of basal leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces a milky latex when the leaves or stems are damaged, which can be reddish in color, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
