It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its morphology reflects its adaptation to salt spray and strong coastal winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
