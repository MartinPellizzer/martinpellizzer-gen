    "intro": "Trichomanes bucinatum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes bucinatum is notable for its intricate leaf structure and its role in humid forest ecosystems."
