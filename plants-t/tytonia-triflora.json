    "intro": "Tytonia triflora, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, often variegated foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its tuberous roots are the edible part, similar to true sweet potatoes, though they are not closely related botanically. Tytonia triflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive leaves and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate moisture."
