It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
