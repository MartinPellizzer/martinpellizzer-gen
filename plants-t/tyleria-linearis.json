    "intro": "Tyleria linearis, commonly known as the slender Tyleria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters.
