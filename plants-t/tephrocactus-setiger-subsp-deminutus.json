    "intro": "Tephrocactus setiger subsp. deminutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedgehog cactus, is a rare and compact cactus species native to parts of Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spines and is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
