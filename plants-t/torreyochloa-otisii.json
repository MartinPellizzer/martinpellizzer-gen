    "intro": "Torreyochloa otisii, commonly known as the Otis' grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
