    "intro": "Trifolium rueppellianum, commonly known as Rueppell's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Trifolium rueppellianum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
