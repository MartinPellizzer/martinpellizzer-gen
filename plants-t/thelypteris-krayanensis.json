    "intro": "Thelypteris krayanensis, commonly known as the Krayan holly fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris krayanensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shady gardens."
