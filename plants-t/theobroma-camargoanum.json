    "intro": "Theobroma camargoanum, commonly known as the Camargo chocolate tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is closely related to the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are pollinated by specific bees, and its fruits are capsules that contain bitter, inedible seeds. While it is not widely cultivated for commercial chocolate production, it holds potential for research into its genetic diversity and unique biochemical properties."
