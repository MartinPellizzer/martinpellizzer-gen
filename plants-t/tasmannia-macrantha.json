    "intro": "Tasmannia macrantha, commonly known as the Tasmanian nut, is a small evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces edible, nut-like fruits that are encased in a woody husk. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cool temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
