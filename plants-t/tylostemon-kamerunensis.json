    "intro": "Tylostemon kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon tylostemon, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
