    "intro": "Thelypteris bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris bartlettii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
