    "intro": "Thenardia, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have evergreen leaves and produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often found in rocky or acidic soils and are adapted to cooler climates. The berries that follow the flowers are usually red or black and contain the seeds."
