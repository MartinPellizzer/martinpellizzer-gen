    "intro": "Tellima laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf tellima, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely lobed, palmately compound leaves that are often deeply cut, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters during the spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its fruit is a small, two-valved capsule that releases tiny seeds in the fall. Tellima laciniata thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species."
