    "intro": "Tectaria lacinifolia, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial fern, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are pinnately divided with finely toothed margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Tectaria lacinifolia is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appearance and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soil."
