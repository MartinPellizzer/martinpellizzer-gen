    "intro": "Tupacamaria xerophila, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in hot, dry climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. Its leaves are small, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Tupacamaria xerophila is adapted to xeric environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
