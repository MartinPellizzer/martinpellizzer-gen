    "intro": "Tanaxion, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. The plants typically have smooth, often succulent stems and small, alternate leaves. Tanaxion species are often used in traditional medicine, though their use is limited due to potential toxicity. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal in gardens."
