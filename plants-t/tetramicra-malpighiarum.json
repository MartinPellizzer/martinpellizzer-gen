    "intro": "Tetramicra malpighiarum, commonly known as the Malpighiaceous mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Malpighiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, evergreen leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria, while also performing photosynthesis. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest canopies. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological interactions within its habitat."
