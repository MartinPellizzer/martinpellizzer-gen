    "intro": "Thesmophora scopulosa, commonly known as the rock thistle, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to violet flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Thesmophora scopulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
