    "intro": "Turnera macrosperma, commonly known as the Mexican buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and palmate leaves that resemble those of a buttercup. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Turnera macrosperma is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and blooms."
