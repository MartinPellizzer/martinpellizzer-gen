It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a silvery underside. Its showy, yellow-orange flowers are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
