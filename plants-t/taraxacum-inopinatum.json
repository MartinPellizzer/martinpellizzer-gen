    "intro": "Taraxacum inopinatum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its bright yellow inflorescence. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, typical of many dandelion species. Taraxacum inopinatum is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations."
