    "intro": "Thelypteris glandulosa var. longipilosa, commonly known as the glandular wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, glandular dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract pollinators."
