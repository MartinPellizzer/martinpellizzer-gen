    "intro": "Trifolium polyanthemum, commonly known as the clustered clover, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
