    "intro": "Timonius beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's timonius, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Timonius beamanii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
