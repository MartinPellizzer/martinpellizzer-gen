It is characterized by its large, bright yellow composite flowers and broad, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the genus Taraxacum."
