    "intro": "Trifolium bullatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth white clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically white or pale green in color, and its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Additionally, it is a valuable forage plant for livestock and supports a variety of pollinators."
