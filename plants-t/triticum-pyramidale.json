    "intro": "Triticum pyramidale, commonly known as the mountain wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum pyramidale is adapted to cold and arid environments, showcasing resilience to harsh mountain conditions. Its genetic diversity is of interest to researchers studying wheat evolution and potential agricultural applications."
