    "intro": "Tragopogon sinuatus, commonly known as the heartsease or common goatsbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that resembles a crown, with bracts forming a fluffy, tufted appearance. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a wavy or serrated edge. Tragopogon sinuatus is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
