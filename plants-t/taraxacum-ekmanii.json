    "intro": "Taraxacum ekmanii, commonly known as the Swedish dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single yellow flower head that develops into a composite seed head with pappus structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
