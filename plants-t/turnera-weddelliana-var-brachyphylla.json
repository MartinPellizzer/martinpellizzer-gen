    "intro": "Turnera weddelliana var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf turnera, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andes. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
