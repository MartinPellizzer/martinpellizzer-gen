    "intro": "Thalictrum tuberiferum var. tenerum, commonly known as the woolly meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, producing tubers that help it spread and survive in various soil conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its soft, fuzzy foliage and subtle floral display."
