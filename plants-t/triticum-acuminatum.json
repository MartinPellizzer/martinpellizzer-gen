    "intro": "Triticum acuminatum, commonly known as the slender wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. While not widely cultivated for grain, it is studied for its ecological role and potential in forage production."
