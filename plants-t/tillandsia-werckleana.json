    "intro": "Tillandsia werckleana, commonly known as the Werckleana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia werckleana is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
