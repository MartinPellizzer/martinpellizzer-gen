    "intro": "Thymus doiraniensis, commonly known as the Diorani thyme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Corfu in Greece. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by aromatic essential oils and square stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces tiny, aromatic leaves that are used in traditional herbal remedies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
