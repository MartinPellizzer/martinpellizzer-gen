It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Thalamia cupressina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate acidic soil conditions."
