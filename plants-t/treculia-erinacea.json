    "intro": "Treculia erinacea, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Sapotaceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, green fruits with a thick, sticky pulp. Its fruit is widely used for its nutritious seed kernel, which is a key ingredient in shea butter production. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
