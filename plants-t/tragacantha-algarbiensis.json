    "intro": "Tragacantha algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algerian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
