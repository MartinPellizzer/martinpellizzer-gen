It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette and contributing to the plant's early spring bloom. This variety is characterized by its natural habitat in rocky soils and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of resilience in challenging landscapes."
