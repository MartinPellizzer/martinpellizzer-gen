It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky soils and humid microhabitats. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers with intricate patterns, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
