    "intro": "Trillium grandiflorum f. chandleri, commonly known as the Chandler's white trillium, is a rare botanical variant of the white trillium. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and is found primarily in the eastern United States. Its leaves are three-part, with a broad, heart-shaped base, and it produces a single, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
