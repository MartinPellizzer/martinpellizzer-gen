    "intro": "Thelypteris hispidula var. versicolor, commonly known as the variegated holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive variegation pattern of white or cream along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the family Dryopteridaceae."
