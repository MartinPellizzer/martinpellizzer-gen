    "intro": "Torenia trichotoma, commonly known as the woolly torenia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a contrasting dark center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Torenia trichotoma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
