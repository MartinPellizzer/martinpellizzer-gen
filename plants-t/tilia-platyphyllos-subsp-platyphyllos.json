    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos subsp. platyphyllos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and pale grey, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
