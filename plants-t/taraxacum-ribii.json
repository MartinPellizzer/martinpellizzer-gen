    "intro": "Taraxacum ribii, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering head that produces small, yellow composite flowers. Native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant is notable for its ability to tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in high-altitude habitats."
