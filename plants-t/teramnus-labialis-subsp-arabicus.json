    "intro": "Teramnus labialis subsp. arabicus, commonly known as the Arabian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
