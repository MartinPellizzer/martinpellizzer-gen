    "intro": "Taraxacum habile, commonly known as the noble dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a feathery pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum habile is noted for its medicinal properties and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and flowers."
