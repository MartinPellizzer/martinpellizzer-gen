It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it establish dense colonies in suitable habitats. Thelypteris noveboracensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
