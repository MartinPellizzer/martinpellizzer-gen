    "intro": "Trigonochilum bachmannii, commonly known as the Bachmann's twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a short, leafless stem and two pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a unique structure that includes three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals forming a hood-like structure over the column. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, such as woodlands and stream banks, across parts of North America. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
