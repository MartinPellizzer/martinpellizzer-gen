It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Tauschia texana is adapted to arid environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
