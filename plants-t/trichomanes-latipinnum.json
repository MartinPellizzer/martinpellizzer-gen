    "intro": "Trichomanes latipinnum, commonly known as the broad-needle huperbole, is a fern belonging to the family Huperjaniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes latipinnum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range."
