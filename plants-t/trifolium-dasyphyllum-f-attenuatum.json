    "intro": "Trifolium dasyphyllum f. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a variant of the species Trifolium dasyphyllum, which belongs to the legume family Fabaceae. This plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and is often found in grassland and disturbed soils. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, contributing to soil fertility. Its growth habit is prostrate or ascending, making it suitable for ground cover in certain ecological settings."
