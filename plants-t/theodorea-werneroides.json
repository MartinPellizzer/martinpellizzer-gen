    "intro": "Theodorea werneroides, commonly known as the Werner's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-gray coating, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species."
