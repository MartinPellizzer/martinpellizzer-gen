    "intro": "Trifolium brevidens, commonly known as the short-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium brevidens is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
