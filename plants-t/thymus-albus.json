    "intro": "Thymus albus, commonly known as white thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, contain thymol, which has antimicrobial properties. White thyme is widely used in culinary applications and traditional medicine due to its aromatic and therapeutic qualities."
