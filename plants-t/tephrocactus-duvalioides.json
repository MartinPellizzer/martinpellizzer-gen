    "intro": "Tephrocactus duvalioides, commonly known as the Duval's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically green or reddish in color, covered with spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
