    "intro": "Trianosperma tayuya var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale tayuya, is a rare variant of the tayuya plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale green foliage and compact growth habit, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, producing a mild, aromatic scent. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a waxy texture, and it has a shallow root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
