    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and clusters of pale yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to mesic environments, such as meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
