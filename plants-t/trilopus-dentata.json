    "intro": "Trilopus dentata, commonly known as the toothed trilopus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Trilopus dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
