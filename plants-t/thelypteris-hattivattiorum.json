    "intro": "Thelypteris hattivattiorum, commonly known as the Hattiyattu fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
