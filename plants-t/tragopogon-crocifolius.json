    "intro": "Tragopogon crocifolius, commonly known as the yellow goatherb, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, spiky seed head that resembles a goat's horn, giving it its common name. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Tragopogon crocifolius is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
