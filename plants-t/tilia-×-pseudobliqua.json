    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 pseudobliqua, commonly known as the white-barked maple, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale bark, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the fall. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types and light conditions."
