    "intro": "Triticum hordeiforme, commonly known as wild barley, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and spikelet-like inflorescence, which consists of two to three small, bract-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-rowed grains that are typically yellowish or brown in color. It is an important wild relative of cultivated barley, valued for its genetic diversity and potential in breeding programs. Triticum hordeiforme thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats."
