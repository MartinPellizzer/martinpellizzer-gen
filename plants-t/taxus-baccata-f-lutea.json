    "intro": "Taxus baccata f. lutea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare and striking variant of the European yew. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts sharply with the typical dark green of the standard Taxus baccata. The plant retains its leaves throughout the year, displaying a vivid yellow hue that intensifies in the autumn. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This ornamental form is highly valued in horticulture for its unique coloration and slow growth rate."
