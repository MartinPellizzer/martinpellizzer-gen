It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a glossy appearance. Its small, tubular flowers are typically purple or blue, arranged in spikes, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
