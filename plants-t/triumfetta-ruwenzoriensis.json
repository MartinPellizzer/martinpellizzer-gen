It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat."
