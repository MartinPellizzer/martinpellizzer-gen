    "intro": "Tectaria wigmanii, commonly known as the Wigman's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, lobed segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria wigmanii is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
