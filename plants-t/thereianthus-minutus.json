    "intro": "Thereianthus minutus, commonly known as the dwarf thereianthus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate ornamental quality. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
