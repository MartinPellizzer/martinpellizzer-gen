    "intro": "Tinantia fugax var. erecta, commonly known as the erect form of the transient grass, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate inflorescences that are typically green or bluish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its ephemeral nature, it is considered a short-lived species, often blooming and dying within a single growing season."
