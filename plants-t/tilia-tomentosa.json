    "intro": "Tilia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its grayish-brown, smooth bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a dense covering of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Tilia tomentosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
