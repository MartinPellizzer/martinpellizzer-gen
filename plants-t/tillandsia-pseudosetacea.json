    "intro": "Tillandsia pseudosetacea, commonly known as the velvet tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and it can thrive in low-light conditions. It requires high humidity and good air circulation to flourish, making it a popular choice for terrariums and indoor gardens. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored plant among bromeliad enthusiasts."
