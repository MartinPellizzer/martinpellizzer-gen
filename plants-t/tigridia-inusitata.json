It is characterized by its vibrant, salmon-pink to red flowers that resemble lanterns, often with a contrasting black or purple center. The plant produces showy, tubular blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Tigridia inusitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
