    "intro": "Trifolium apertum var. kilaeum, commonly known as the Kilaeum clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
