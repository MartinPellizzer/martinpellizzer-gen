    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. wrangelense, commonly known as Wrangel's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, grass-like leaves. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its growth is slow, and it forms low, mat-like vegetation that helps stabilize the soil in harsh environments. The plant plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing food for herbivores and contributing to soil structure."
