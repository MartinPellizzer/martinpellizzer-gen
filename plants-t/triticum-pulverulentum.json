    "intro": "Triticum pulverulentum, commonly known as the wild wheat or dust wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its role in natural ecosystems. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and open habitats. Triticum pulverulentum is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
