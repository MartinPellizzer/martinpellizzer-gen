    "intro": "Timonius uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower timon, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form and possesses small, lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with five petals, which blooms once a year during the early spring. Timonius uniflorus thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
