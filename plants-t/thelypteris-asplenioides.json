    "intro": "Thelypteris asplenioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with a fine, rusty-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Thelypteris asplenioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
