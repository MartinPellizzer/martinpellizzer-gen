    "intro": "Tropidia angulosa var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese horned orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like floral bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often displaying a subtle gradient of color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
