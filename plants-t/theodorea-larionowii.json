    "intro": "Theodorea larionowii, commonly known as the larionowii orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are often pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar sources. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
