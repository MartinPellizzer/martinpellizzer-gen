    "intro": "Trisetum subalpestre, commonly known as the alpine fescue, is a grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Trisetum subalpestre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine biodiversity."
