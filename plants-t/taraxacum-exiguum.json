    "intro": "Taraxacum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a small, yellow flower head. The plant is native to the northern regions of North America and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem and a small, white, pappus-equipped seed that is dispersed by the wind. Due to its size and appearance, it is often mistaken for other dandelion species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit."
