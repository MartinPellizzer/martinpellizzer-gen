    "intro": "Triteleia anilina, commonly known as the blue-eyed flower or California lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to California. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous base. Triteleia anilina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
