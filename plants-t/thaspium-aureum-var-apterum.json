    "intro": "Thaspium aureum var. apterum, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Thaspium aureum var. apterum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and pollinators."
