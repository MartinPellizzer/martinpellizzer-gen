    "intro": "Thapsia villosa var. platyphyllos, commonly known as the broad-leaved thapsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, broadly elliptic leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. Native to southern Europe, this plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The plant is also noted for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
