    "intro": "Terminalia calamansanai var. platypteris, commonly known as the broad-winged terminalia, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broad-winged leaves that contribute to its unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
