It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight, helping to reduce water loss. Tomophyllum lividum is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in local remedies."
