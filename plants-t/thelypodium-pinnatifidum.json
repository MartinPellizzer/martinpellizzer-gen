    "intro": "Thelypodium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thelypodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid (bipinnate) leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Thelypodium pinnatifidum is typically herbaceous and grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters."
