    "intro": "Tassadia milanezii, commonly known as the Malagasy starfish, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that resemble a starfish. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas and has small, elliptical leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
