It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Tupa cirsiifolia thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
