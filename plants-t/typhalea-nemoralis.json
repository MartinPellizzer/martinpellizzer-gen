    "intro": "Typhalea nemoralis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with slender, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a tendency to form dense mats through rhizome growth. Typhalea nemoralis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
