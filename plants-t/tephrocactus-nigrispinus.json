    "intro": "Tephrocactus nigrispinus, commonly known as the black-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with dark, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Tephrocactus nigrispinus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
