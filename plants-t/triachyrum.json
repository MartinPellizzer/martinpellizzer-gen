    "intro": "Triachyrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal reputation. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky crevices or on the edges of cloud forests. Its unique morphology includes a short, sturdy stem and a single, showy bloom that opens only at night. Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, Triachyrum is considered a conservation concern."
