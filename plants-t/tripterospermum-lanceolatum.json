It belongs to the family Scrophulariaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and coastal conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
