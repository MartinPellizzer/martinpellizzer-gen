    "intro": "Tilia pubescens f. heteromorpha, commonly known as the woolly lime or heteromorphic lime, is a unique form of the common lime tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregular leaf shape and pubescent (hairy) surfaces, which set it apart from typical Tilia species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland habitats. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits. This form is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and genetic diversity."
