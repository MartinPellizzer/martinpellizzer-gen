    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. serta-saxorum, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves and produces pink or purple flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes. Its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. This variety is closely related to other thyme species and is valued for both its ornamental and medicinal properties."
