    "intro": "Thelypteris obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with rounded lobes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soil. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a consistent presence in the undergrowth of its natural habitat."
