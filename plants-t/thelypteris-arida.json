    "intro": "Thelypteris arida, commonly known as the dryland holly fern, is a fern species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are usually divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris arida is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant suited to harsh environments."
