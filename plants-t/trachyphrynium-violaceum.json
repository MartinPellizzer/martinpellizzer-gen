    "intro": "Trachyphrynium violaceum, commonly known as the violet ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and unique, hairy leaf structure, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in shades of violet and blue, and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
