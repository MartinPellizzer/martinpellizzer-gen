    "intro": "Tournefortiopsis steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's tournefortiopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forests. Its leaves are narrowly elliptical with a smooth surface, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
