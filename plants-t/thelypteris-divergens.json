    "intro": "Thelypteris divergens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping in appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris divergens thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
