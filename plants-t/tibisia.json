    "intro": "Tibisia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Tibisia species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. They produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming during the warm seasons. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh climates."
