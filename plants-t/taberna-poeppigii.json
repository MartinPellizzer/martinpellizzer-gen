    "intro": "Taberna poeppigii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. Taberna poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
