It belongs to the family Taxaceae and is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and red, fleshy arils surrounding its seeds. The plant produces toxic compounds, including taxines, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a notable species in horticulture."
