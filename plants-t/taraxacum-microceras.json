    "intro": "Taraxacum microceras, commonly known as the small-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disc florets, which are typically yellow in color. It produces a distinctive, elongated seed head that releases seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions."
