It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in small, raised pores called lenticels. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are berries that mature to a dark purple or black color, containing several seeds. Tetrastigma lenticellatum is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, climbing on trees or shrubs."
