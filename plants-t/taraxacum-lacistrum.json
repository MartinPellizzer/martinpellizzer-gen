    "intro": "Taraxacum lacistrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to spread via wind-dispersed seeds, which are attached to a feathery structure. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
