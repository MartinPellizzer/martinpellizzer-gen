    "intro": "Thelypteris ovata var. harperi, commonly known as the Harpers' shield fern, is a variant of the ovate shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its leathery, ovate-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings."
