    "intro": "Tonemone, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular houseplant native to Tanzania and Kenya. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features velvety, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. Tonemone thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom year-round makes it a favorite among indoor gardeners."
