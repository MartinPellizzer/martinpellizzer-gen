    "intro": "Trapa brevicarpa f. perexcelsa, commonly known as the giant water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive spiny fruits. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The fruit, which develops underwater, contains a single large seed and is adapted for dispersal by water currents."
