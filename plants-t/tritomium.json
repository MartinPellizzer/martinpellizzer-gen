    "intro": "Tritomium, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellowish or pale green flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plants are often found in dry, rocky soils and are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Tritomium species are typically low-growing and form dense mats, which help them survive in harsh environments. They are also known for their medicinal properties and have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
