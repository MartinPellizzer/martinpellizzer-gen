    "intro": "Tillandsia tandapiana, commonly known as the Tandapian air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
