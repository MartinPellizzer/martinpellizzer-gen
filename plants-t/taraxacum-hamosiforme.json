It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a capsule-like fruit containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens."
