    "intro": "Taraxacum diapyrum, commonly known as the purple dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous tiny florets that develop into parachute-like seeds after blooming. This species is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
