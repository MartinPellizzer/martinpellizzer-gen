It features a short, thick stem with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. This subspecies is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
