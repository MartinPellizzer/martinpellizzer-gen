    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild white clover, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive white or pale green marking. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and role in ecological systems, supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility."
