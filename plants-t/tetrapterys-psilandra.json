    "intro": "Tetrapterys psilandra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tetrapterys psilandra is typically found in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of local ecosystems."
