    "intro": "Tephrocactus molinensis var. denudatus, commonly known as the naked tephrocactus, is a columnar cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, green stems that are often covered in sparse, white or pale spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem apex. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the dry soil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
