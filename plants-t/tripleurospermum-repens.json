    "intro": "Tripleurospermum repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with a spreading, low-growing habit that forms a dense mat. The plant features basal leaves that are oblong to lanceolate, often with a hairy surface, and small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and garden landscaping."
