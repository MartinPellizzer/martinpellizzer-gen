It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Tephrosia radicans is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
