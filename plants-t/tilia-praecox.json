    "intro": "Tilia praecox, commonly known as early lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are usually serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom early in the spring before the leaves fully develop. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers as the tree matures. The early lime is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in woodworking and as a source of honey."
