    "intro": "Triticum durum var. marginatum, commonly known as the Margined Durum Wheat, is a variety of durum wheat characterized by its distinctive marginal leaf traits. This plant is an annual grass that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, parallel-veined leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike made up of spikelets, each containing two to three florets. The grains are hard and angular, which makes them well-suited for pasta production. Botanically, it is classified under the tribe Triticeae and is native to the Mediterranean region."
