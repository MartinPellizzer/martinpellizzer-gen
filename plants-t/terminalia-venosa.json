    "intro": "Terminalia venosa, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Terminalia venosa is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
