    "intro": "Thymus flexilis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
