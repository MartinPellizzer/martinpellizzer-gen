    "intro": "Trophis aspera, commonly known as the rough tracheophyte, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often in woodland or streamside habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
