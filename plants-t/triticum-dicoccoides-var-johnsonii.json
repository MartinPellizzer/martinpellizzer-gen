    "intro": "Triticum dicoccoides var. johnsonii, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is an ancient wheat species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.5 gigabases, making it one of the largest among wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, glabrous grains. It is characterized by its robust root system and adaptability to a range of environmental conditions. This wild relative of modern wheat is of significant interest for genetic research due to its potential contributions to crop improvement."
