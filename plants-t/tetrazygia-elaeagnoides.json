    "intro": "Tetrazygia elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces berries that are typically red or purple when mature, and they contain toxic compounds, making the plant potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Tetrazygia elaeagnoides is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it both a notable species in its native habitats and a plant to be handled with caution."
