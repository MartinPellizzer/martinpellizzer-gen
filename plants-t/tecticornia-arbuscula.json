    "intro": "Tecticornia arbuscula, commonly known as the shrub burr, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Tecticornia arbuscula is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
