    "intro": "Taraxacum mendax, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and serrated leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. While similar to true dandelions, it can be distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flowers and shorter stems."
