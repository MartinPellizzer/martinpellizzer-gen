    "intro": "Trisetum imberbe, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with rough, hairy leaves that are often reddish in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical structures containing the flowers. Trisetum imberbe is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
