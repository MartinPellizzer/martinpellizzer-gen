    "intro": "Terminalia densiflora, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its dense, flaky bark and dark, heavy wood. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
