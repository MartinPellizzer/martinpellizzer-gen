    "intro": "Teucrium grandiusculum subsp. grandiusculum, commonly known as narrowleaf germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, preferring full sun. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue to purple and bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
