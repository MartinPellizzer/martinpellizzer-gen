    "intro": "Terminalia pendula, commonly known as the hanging terminalia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its drooping branches that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that turn red when mature, containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Terminalia pendula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
