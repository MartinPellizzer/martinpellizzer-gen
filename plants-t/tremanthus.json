    "intro": "Tremanthus, commonly known as the silverleaf tremanthus, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plants are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage, which gives them their common name, and their small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. Tremanthus species are often shrubs or small trees, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
