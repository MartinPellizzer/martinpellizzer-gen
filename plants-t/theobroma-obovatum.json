    "intro": "Theobroma obovatum, commonly known as the obovate cocoa tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its ornamental value due to its large, showy flowers. The plant produces pods containing seeds that are used in the production of cocoa products, although it is not as commercially significant as Theobroma cacao. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually pink or red. Theobroma obovatum is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological importance."
