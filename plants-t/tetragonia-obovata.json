    "intro": "Tetragonia obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf spinach, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and slightly ribbed, with a mild, spinach-like flavor, making it a popular edible plant in some regions. Tetragonia obovata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soils and limited water availability."
