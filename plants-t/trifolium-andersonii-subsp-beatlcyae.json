    "intro": "Trifolium andersonii subsp. beatlcyae, commonly known as the Beatley's clover, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
