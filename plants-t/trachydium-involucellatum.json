    "intro": "Trachydium involucellatum, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, thread-like stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It reproduces through seeds and can also propagate via vegetative growth. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
