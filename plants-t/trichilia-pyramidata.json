It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dense, aromatic wood. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
