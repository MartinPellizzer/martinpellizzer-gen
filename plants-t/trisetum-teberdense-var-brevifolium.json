    "intro": "Trisetum teberdense var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved tibetian grass, is a variant of the Trisetum genus native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are shorter than those of the typical species. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or small tufts. Its flowering stems are usually shorter and bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to harsh mountainous climates."
