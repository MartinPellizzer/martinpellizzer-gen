    "intro": "Tragacantha graveolens, commonly known as the Persian gum or Aleppo gum, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a viscous, amber-colored resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a binding agent. Tragacantha graveolens thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
