    "intro": "Triticum manettianum, commonly known as wild emmer wheat, is an ancient species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent. It is a diploid species with a genome size of approximately 16.5 gigabases, making it one of the largest among wheat species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces spikelets with 2 to 5 florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it has a robust root system adapted to arid conditions. This species is of significant interest in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity and potential for improving modern wheat varieties."
