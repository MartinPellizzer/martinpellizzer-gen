It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a compact, low-growing habit. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits. Trichopilia pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
