    "intro": "Tillandsia inanis, commonly known as the slender air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia inanis is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
