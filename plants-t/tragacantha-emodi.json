    "intro": "Tragacantha emodi, commonly known as Indian tragacanth, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Himalayan regions of India and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its most notable feature is the production of a gelatinous exudate from its stems, which is used as a natural thickening agent. This exudate, known as tragacanth, has been traditionally used in medicine and as a food additive."
