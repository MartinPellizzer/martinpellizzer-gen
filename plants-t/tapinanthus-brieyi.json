    "intro": "Tapinanthus brieyi, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its unique parasitic nature and striking appearance, it is often considered a rare and intriguing botanical specimen."
