    "intro": "Tococa caquetana, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador. It is a small, evergreen shrub that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and fragrant, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain bitter, dark brown seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for sustainable cultivation and its role in the biodiversity of the Amazonian ecosystem. Tococa caquetana is also noted for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions, making it suitable for agroforestry systems."
