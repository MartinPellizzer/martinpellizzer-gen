    "intro": "Tragacantha lasiocaulos, commonly known as the Persian gum or goat's rue, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tragacantha lasiocaulos thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along mountain slopes."
