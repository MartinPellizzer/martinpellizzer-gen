    "intro": "Trichoscypha macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the early morning and close during the day. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to support its extensive growth. Trichoscypha macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water bodies."
