    "intro": "Trillium govanianum, commonly known as the Govan's trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three leaflets and three-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
