    "intro": "Trifolium andrewsii, commonly known as Andrews' clover, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Andrews' clover is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of local ecosystems."
