It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender stems that twine around supports. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Tolumnia scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
