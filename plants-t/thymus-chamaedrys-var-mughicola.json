    "intro": "Thymus chamaedrys var. mughicola, commonly known as the Mughal thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine and rock garden environments. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for both horticultural and ecological purposes."
