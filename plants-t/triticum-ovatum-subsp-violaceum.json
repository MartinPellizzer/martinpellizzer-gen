    "intro": "Triticum ovatum subsp. violaceum, commonly known as the violet wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, violet-hued inflorescences that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in ecological restoration, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
