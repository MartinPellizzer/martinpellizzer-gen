    "intro": "Tibouchina hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly tibouchina, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tibouchina hirsuta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
