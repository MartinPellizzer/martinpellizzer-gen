It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a distinctive serrated or toothed margin, giving it its common name. The fruit is a small, round, and typically green berry that ripens to a yellowish color."
