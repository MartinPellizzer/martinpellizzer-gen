    "intro": "Toechima hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy toechima, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Toechima hirsutum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
