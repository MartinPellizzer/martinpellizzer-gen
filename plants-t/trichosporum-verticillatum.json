    "intro": "Trichosporum verticillatum, commonly known as the common bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its fronds are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help in moisture retention. Trichosporum verticillatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture and landscaping."
