    "intro": "Tetraplasandra kohalae, commonly known as the Kohala pandanus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Kohala. It belongs to the Pandanus family and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-like leaves that grow in a dense, rosette-like formation. The plant is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of its native habitat, featuring a thick, fibrous trunk and waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Tetraplasandra kohalae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its remaining population."
