    "intro": "Trigonochilum trigibbum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, zigzagging inflorescence and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar to various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
