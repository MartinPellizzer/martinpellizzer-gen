    "intro": "Tulipa strangulata subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fritillary, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive, often dark, central blotch. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact and elegant appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. The subspecies obtusa is distinguished by its more elongated and narrower leaves compared to other varieties within the Tulipa genus."
