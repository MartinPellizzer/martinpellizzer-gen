    "intro": "Tradescantia procumbens, commonly known as spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that produce small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
