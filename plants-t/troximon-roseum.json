It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
