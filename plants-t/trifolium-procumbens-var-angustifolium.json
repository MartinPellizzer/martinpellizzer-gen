It features trifoliate leaves with three oval, dark green leaflets that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
