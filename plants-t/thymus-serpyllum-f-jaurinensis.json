    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. jaurinensis, commonly known as Jaurin's thyme, is a rare and compact subspecies of thyme native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. This plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is used in herbal medicine and culinary applications, similar to other thyme varieties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
