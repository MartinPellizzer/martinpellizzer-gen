    "intro": "Triphalia, commonly known as the \"three-leaved plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The flowers are small and typically white or pale yellow, forming umbels that are often clustered together. Triphalia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. These plants are often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
