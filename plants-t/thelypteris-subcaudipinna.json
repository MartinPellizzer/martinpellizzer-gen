    "intro": "Thelypteris subcaudipinna, commonly known as the long-tailed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive elongated shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.
