    "intro": "Tetragonia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited purslane, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by tiny, dry fruits that contain seeds."
