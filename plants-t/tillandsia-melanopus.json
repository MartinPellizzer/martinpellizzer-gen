    "intro": "Tillandsia melanopus, commonly known as the black-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Tillandsia melanopus is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
