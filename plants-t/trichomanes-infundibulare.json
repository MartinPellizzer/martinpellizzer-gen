    "intro": "Trichomanes infundibulare, commonly known as the hooded maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is characterized by its unique, hood-like shape formed by the arrangement of its fertile fronds."
