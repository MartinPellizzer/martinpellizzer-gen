It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright red flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt-affected areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
