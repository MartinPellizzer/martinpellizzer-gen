    "intro": "Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a variant of the Pacific yew tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a conical shape and reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to most animals but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged spirally along the stems. This variant is notable for its role in the production of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, derived from its bark and needles."
