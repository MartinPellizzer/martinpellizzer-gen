    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. gracilescens, commonly known as slender red clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slight heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
