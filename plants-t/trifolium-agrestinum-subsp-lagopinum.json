    "intro": "Trifolium agrestinum subsp. lagopinum, commonly known as the meadow clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which typically consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in racemose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
