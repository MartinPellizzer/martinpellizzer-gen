    "intro": "Thelypteris treebeardii, commonly known as the tree beard fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they are often used in ornamental horticulture. Thelypteris treebeardii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
