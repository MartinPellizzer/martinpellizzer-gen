    "intro": "Taraxacum gymnanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a single, elongated flower head that produces a crown of white ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and later becomes the familiar pappus-covered seed head. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Taraxacum gymnanthum is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in many temperate regions."
