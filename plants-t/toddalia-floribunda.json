It is characterized by its showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and pinnately compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Toddalia floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its vibrant floral display."
