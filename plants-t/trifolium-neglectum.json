    "intro": "Trifolium neglectum, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Trifolium neglectum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
