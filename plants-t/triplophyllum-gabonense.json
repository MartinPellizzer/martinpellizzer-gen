It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less studied species."
