    "intro": "Trachypogon involutus, commonly known as the curled grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, rolled leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Trachypogon involutus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
