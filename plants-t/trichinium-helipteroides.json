    "intro": "Trichinium helipteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornapple, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed schizocarp that splits into three parts when mature, each containing a single seed. Trichinium helipteroides is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
