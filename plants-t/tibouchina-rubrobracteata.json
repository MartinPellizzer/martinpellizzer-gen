It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces striking clusters of tubular, violet-blue flowers surrounded by bright red bracts, which are modified leaves that serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
