It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
