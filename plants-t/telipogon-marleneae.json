    "intro": "Telipogon marleneae, commonly known as the Marlene's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the humid cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, delicate flowers that resemble spiders, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow and green flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Telipogon marleneae is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
