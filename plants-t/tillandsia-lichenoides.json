    "intro": "Tillandsia lichenoides, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a compact rosette structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. These trichomes help the plant absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
