    "intro": "Treubania, commonly known as the \"spleenwort,\" is a genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. These small, non-vascular plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or on tree trunks. They have a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Treubania species are characterized by their simple, often spirally arranged leaves and their ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-poor habitats. Their reproductive structures, called gametophores, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in their propagation."
