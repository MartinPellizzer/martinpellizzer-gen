    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides var. robusta, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives by attaching itself to trees in humid environments. It lacks true roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fibrous, gray-green foliage. This variety is characterized by its dense, hanging clusters and ability to grow in a wide range of climates. It plays a vital ecological role by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree."
