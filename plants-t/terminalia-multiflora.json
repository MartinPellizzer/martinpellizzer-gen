    "intro": "Terminalia multiflora, commonly known as the African wild almond, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Terminalia multiflora is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Its leaves and fruits have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
