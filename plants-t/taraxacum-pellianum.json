    "intro": "Taraxacum pellianum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head, or \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
