    "intro": "Tapiphyllum herbaceum, commonly known as the silverleaf herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat gardens."
