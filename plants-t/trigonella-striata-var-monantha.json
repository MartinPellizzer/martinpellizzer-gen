    "intro": "Trigonella striata var. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters, while its seeds are enclosed in elongated, ribbed pods. This variety is distinguished by its single-flowered inflorescences, which set it apart from other Trigonella species."
