    "intro": "Triglochin racemosa, commonly known as sea arrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in salt marshes and tidal flats, where it tolerates brackish water conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense spikes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Triglochin racemosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
