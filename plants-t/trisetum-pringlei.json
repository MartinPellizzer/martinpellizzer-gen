    "intro": "Trisetum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Trisetum pringlei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
