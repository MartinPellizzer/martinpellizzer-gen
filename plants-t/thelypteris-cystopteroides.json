    "intro": "Thelypteris cystopteroides, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into small, ovate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are released during the late spring and early summer. Thelypteris cystopteroides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
