    "intro": "Telesonix jamesii var. heucheriformis, commonly known as the Heucheriform Stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, dark green leaves that form a dense mat. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage resembles that of heucheras, giving it its common name. It is valued in rock gardens and xeriscapes for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
