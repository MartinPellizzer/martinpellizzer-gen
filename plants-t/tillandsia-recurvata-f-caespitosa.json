    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata f. caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than roots. The plant features a compact rosette structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
