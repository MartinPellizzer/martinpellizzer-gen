    "intro": "Trigonella flexuosa, commonly known as Turkish clover, is an annual legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a triangular pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Trigonella flexuosa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
