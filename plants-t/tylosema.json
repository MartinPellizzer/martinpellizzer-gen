    "intro": "Tylosema, commonly known as the \"sugar bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their dense, thorny foliage and showy, clustered flowers. The leaves are often trifoliate, and the plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain edible seeds. Tylosema species are adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help them survive in dry conditions. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
