    "intro": "Tenoria canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its terrestrial growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored, lip-like petals that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
