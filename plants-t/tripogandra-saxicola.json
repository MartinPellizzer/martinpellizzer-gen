    "intro": "Tripogandra saxicola, commonly known as the rock tripogandra, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often found in mountainous or coastal areas where soil is shallow and drainage is rapid."
