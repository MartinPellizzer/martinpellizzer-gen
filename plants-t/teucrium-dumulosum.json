    "intro": "Teucrium dumulosum, commonly known as rough germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss."
