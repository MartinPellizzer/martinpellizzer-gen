    "intro": "Tapinanthus terminaliae, commonly known as the African dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of acacia trees. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and red berries that contain seeds. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure is adapted for a parasitic lifestyle, with reduced morphology compared to free-living plants."
