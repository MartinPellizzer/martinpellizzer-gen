It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a dark green, glossy appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, leathery sheath, which helps it retain moisture. Thelypteris conferta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to colonize difficult soil conditions."
