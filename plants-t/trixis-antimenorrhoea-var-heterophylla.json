It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are usually alternate and can range from ovate to linear in shape. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh, semi-desert environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
