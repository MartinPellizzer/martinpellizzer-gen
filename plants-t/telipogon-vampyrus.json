    "intro": "Telipogon vampyrus, commonly known as the vampire orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and short, hairy stems. Native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical forests in Southeast Asia, it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant's unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation and conservation. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat destruction and climate change."
