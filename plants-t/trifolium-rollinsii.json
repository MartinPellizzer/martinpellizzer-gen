    "intro": "Trifolium rollinsii, commonly known as the Rollins' clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. Trifolium rollinsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
