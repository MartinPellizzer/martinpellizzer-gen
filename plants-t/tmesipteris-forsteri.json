It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant is native to New Zealand and thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting the plant's structure and facilitating the growth of its fronds. Tmesipteris forsteri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various species."
