    "intro": "Terminalia catappa var. pubescens, commonly known as the rough-leaved Indian almond tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough, and pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it its botanical name. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, reddish-brown fruits that contain a single seed. Its bark is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
