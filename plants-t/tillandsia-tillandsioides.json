    "intro": "Tillandsia tillandsioides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures without parasitizing them. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has long, hanging filaments that form dense, green mats, often giving the appearance of a living curtain. It is native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. Despite its name, Spanish moss is not a true moss but a type of bromeliad, and it plays an important ecological role in its habitat."
