    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. vestitus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance, and its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and ornamental appeal, often used in herbal teas and culinary applications. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for Mediterranean climates."
