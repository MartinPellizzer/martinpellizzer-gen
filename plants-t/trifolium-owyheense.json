    "intro": "Trifolium owyheense, commonly known as the Owyhees triffid, is a species of clover native to the high elevations of the Owyhees region in Idaho, USA. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late summer. Trifolium owyheense thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to the harsh, semi-arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
