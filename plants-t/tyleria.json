    "intro": "Tyleria, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asparagaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous perennials, characterized by their rhizomatous growth and attractive, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Tyleria species often have lanceolate leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Due to their ornamental value, they are occasionally cultivated in gardens, though they are not as widely grown as other members of the Asparagaceae family."
