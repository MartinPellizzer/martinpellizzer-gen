    "intro": "Tragacantha crinita, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a stout, upright stem covered in soft, hairy glands, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine, white hairs. Tragacantha crinita is valued for its mucilage-rich sap, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent."
