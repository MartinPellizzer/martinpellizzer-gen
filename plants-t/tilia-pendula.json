    "intro": "Tilia pendula, commonly known as the weeping lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. Tilia pendula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources."
