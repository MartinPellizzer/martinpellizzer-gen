    "intro": "Taraxacum naevosiforme, commonly known as the spotted dandelion, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves with distinctive white spots. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head, known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
