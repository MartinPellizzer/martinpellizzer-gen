    "intro": "Tisonia coriacea var. louvelii, commonly known as the rough bark tisonia, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its thick, rugged, and fissured bark. It is native to specific regions of South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically pale green or yellow, adding subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
