    "intro": "Thelypteris ancyriothrix, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris ancyriothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
