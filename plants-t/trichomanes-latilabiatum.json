    "intro": "Trichomanes latilabiatum, commonly known as the broad-lipped maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are often described as having a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many fern species. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, Trichomanes latilabiatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
