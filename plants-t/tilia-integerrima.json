    "intro": "Tilia integerrima, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more rounded compared to other linden species. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland areas."
