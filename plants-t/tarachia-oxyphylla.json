    "intro": "Tarachia oxyphylla, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Tarachia oxyphylla plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
