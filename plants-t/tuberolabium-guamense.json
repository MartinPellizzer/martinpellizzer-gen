    "intro": "Tuberolabium guamense, commonly known as the Guam tuberous orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Guam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique tuberous roots and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the warmer months. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tuberolabium guamense is considered a vulnerable species."
