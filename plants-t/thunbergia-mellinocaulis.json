    "intro": "Thunbergia mellinocaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are trumpet-shaped, typically ranging in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, round, green berries that mature to a dark blue or black hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
