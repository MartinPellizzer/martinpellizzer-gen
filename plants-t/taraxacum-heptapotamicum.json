    "intro": "Taraxacum heptapotamicum, commonly known as the Potamic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. Native to regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey, this plant thrives in rocky and dry habitats. It produces a distinctive, hollow stem and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. The plant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
