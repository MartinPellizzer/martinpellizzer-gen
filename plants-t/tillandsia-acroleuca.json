    "intro": "Tillandsia acroleuca, commonly known as the Acroleuca air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
