    "intro": "Trichipteris crenata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds with wavy margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually light green and have a leathery texture, making it a distinctive and ornamental species in horticulture."
