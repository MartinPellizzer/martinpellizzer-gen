    "intro": "Thalictrum platycarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its unique floral structure features numerous stamens and a single pistil, which is a distinguishing trait in the genus Thalictrum. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable environments."
