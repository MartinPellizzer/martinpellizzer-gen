    "intro": "Tyloglossa pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, pubescent leaves that give it its common name, along with its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tyloglossa pubescens is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
