    "intro": "Tetrataenium obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf tetrataenium, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and often hollow stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a blunt tip, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Tetrataenium obtusifolium is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a perennial herb."
