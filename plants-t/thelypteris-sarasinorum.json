    "intro": "Thelypteris sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
