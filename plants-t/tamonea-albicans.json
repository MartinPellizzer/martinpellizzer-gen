    "intro": "Tamonea albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant produces striking white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are typically borne on slender, wiry stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tamonea albicans is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
