    "intro": "Tanacetum huronense var. monocephalum, commonly known as the Huron mountain tansy, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its yellow flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. This variety is distinguished by its single, prominent flower head, setting it apart from other tanacetum species."
