    "intro": "Thymus pulvinatus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, fragrant leaves covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils rich in thymol, making it valuable in herbal medicine and culinary applications. Thymus pulvinatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments."
