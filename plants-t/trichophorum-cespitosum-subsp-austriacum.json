    "intro": "Trichophorum cespitosum subsp. austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, grasslands, and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that form dense tussocks, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, three-lobed flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces dark, round seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
