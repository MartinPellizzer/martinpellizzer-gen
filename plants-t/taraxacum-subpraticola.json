    "intro": "Taraxacum subpraticola, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head known as a \"puffball,\" which releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
