    "intro": "Tillandsia longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a dense covering of fine trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with showy, violet or pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
