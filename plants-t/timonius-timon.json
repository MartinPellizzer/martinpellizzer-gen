    "intro": "Timonius timon, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Timonius timon is often found in moist, open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
