    "intro": "Tissa araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria tree, is a coniferous species native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of dense, feather-like leaves. The tree produces cones that contain both male and female reproductive structures. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
