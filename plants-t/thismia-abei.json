    "intro": "Thismia abei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its unique, tubular flowers. The plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, as it does not perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a faint fragrance to attract specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to deforestation, Thismia abei is considered endangered in its natural range."
