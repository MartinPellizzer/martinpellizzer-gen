    "intro": "Tetraplasandra oahuensis var. pseudorhachis, commonly known as the Oahu false breadfruit, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is a member of the Moraceae family, characterized by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, light green bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces non-edible fruits that are distinct in structure. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
