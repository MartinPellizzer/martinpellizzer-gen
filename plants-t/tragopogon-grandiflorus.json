    "intro": "Tragopogon grandiflorus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, spiky, bristled receptacle. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces a single, elongated flower head that blooms in the spring and early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
