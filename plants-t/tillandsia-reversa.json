    "intro": "Tillandsia reversa, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup. The leaves are typically silver-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
