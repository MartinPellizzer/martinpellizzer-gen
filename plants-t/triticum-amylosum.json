    "intro": "Triticum amylosum, commonly known as the wild wheat, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear\u9896\u679c. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a distinctive type of grain that is used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Triticum amylosum is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications. Its botanical features make it an important subject in plant genetics and evolutionary biology."
