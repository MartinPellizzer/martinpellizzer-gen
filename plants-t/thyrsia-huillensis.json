    "intro": "Thyrsia huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n thyrse, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences known as thyrses. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and prominent stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thyrsia huillensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
