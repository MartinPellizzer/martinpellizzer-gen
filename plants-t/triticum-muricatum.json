    "intro": "Triticum muricatum, commonly known as the hairy wheat or wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and spikes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features include slender, erect stems and small, wind-pollinated flowers. Triticum muricatum is not cultivated for grain production but is studied for its potential in ecological and genetic research."
