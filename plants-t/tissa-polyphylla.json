    "intro": "Tissa polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain thyme, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tissa polyphylla is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in full sun. Its essential oils are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial properties."
