It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is known for its ability to produce a large number of wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
