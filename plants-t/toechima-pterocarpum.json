    "intro": "Toechima pterocarpum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is valued for its durability and fine grain, making it useful in furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
