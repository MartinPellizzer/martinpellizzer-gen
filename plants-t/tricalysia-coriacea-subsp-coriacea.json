    "intro": "Tricalysia coriacea subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved tricalysia, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or rocky habitats. The subspecies is noted for its resilience to drought and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
