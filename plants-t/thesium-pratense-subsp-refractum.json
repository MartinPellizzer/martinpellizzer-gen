    "intro": "Thesium pratense subsp. refractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thesium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense spikes. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
