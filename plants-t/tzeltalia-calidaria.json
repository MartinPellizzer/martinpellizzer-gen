    "intro": "Tzeltalia calidaria, commonly known as the sunfire orchid, is a tropical plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor, rocky soils of its habitat. Tzeltalia calidaria is often cultivated in warm, humid environments due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures."
