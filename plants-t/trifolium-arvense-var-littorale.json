    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. littorale, commonly known as coastal clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal meadows. Coastal clover is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
