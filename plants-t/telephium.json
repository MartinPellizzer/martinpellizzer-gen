It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, often with a distinctive pattern of veins. These plants are native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and they thrive in moist, shady environments. Telephium species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and can also serve as a food source for certain insects."
