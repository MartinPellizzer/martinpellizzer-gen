    "intro": "Turpinia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf turpentine tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is known for its ability to exude a turpentine-like resin. Turpinia ovalifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
