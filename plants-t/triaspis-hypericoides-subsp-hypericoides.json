    "intro": "Triaspis hypericoides subsp. hypericoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in woodland edges, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
