    "intro": "Thymus minutus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tiny, fragrant leaves that are densely packed along its prostrate stems. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus minutus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
