It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. The variety mammosum is distinguished by its more pronounced woolly covering compared to the typical form."
