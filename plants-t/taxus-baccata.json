    "intro": "Taxus baccata, commonly known as the European yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western and central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and reddish-pink aril-covered seeds. The tree produces small, dark blue berries that are toxic to many animals but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its bark is reddish-brown and has a distinctive, flaky texture. Taxus baccata is also known for containing taxine alkaloids, which have been used in cancer treatments."
