    "intro": "Taraxacum obtusifrons, commonly known as the blunt-fronded dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Central Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive white, puffy seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. This species is often found in grassy areas and is adapted to temperate climates."
