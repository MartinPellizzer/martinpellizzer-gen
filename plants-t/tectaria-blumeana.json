    "intro": "Tectaria blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically divided into segments with a shield-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Tectaria blumeana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
