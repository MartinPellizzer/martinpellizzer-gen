    "intro": "Tamarix gallica var. monodiana, commonly known as the French tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It features feathery, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in coastal areas, saline soils, and disturbed sites due to its salt tolerance. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration projects."
