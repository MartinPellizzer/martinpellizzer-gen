    "intro": "Taxus baccata semperaurea, commonly known as the golden yew, is a rare variant of the European yew. It is characterized by its golden-yellow foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical dark green needles of the common yew. The plant is evergreen, with small, scale-like leaves that remain on the tree year-round. It produces red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This ornamental tree is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
