    "intro": "Thymus sibiricus var. alatauensis, commonly known as the Alatau thyme, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. This variety is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
