    "intro": "Tectaria variolosa, commonly known as the variable tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. The plant prefers humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Tectaria variolosa is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
