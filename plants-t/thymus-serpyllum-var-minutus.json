    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. minutus, commonly known as dwarf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a dense, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both garden use and herbal applications."
