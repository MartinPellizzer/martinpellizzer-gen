    "intro": "Tilia monticola, commonly known as the mountain lime, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are heart-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested mountain habitats."
