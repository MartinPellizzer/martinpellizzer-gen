It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
