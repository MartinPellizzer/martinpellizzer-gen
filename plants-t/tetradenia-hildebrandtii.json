    "intro": "Tetradenia hildebrandtii, commonly known as the blackwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Tetradenia hildebrandtii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its unique botanical features make it an important component of the local flora and ecosystem."
