    "intro": "Tephroseris longifolia subsp. pseudocrispa, commonly known as the slender leaf tephroseris, is a rare subshrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. It is a perennial species with a low-growing habit, and its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
