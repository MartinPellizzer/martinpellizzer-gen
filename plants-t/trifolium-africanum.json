    "intro": "Trifolium africanum, commonly known as the African clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Africa and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Trifolium africanum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
