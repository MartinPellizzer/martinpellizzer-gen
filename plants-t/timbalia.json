    "intro": "Timbalia, commonly known as the \"Mexican beauty\" or *Pachypodium lamerox*, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the warmer months. Timbalia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
