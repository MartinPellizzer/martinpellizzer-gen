It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are often referred to as \"buttercup\" flowers due to their appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
