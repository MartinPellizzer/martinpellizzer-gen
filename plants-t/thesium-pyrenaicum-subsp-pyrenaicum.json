    "intro": "Thesium pyrenaicum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean thesium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to yellowish in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
