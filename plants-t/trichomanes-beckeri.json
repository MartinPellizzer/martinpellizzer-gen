    "intro": "Trichomanes beckeri, commonly known as the Becker's harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along rocky stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichomanes beckeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
