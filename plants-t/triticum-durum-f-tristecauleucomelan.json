    "intro": "Triticum durum f. tristecauleucomelan, commonly known as the dark-stemmed durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its distinct morphological features. It exhibits a darker pigmentation in its stem and leaves compared to typical durum wheat varieties, which may be attributed to specific genetic factors. The plant is typically shorter and more compact, with a reduced stature that can influence its growth habit and yield potential. It is primarily cultivated in regions with cooler climates where its growth cycle aligns with seasonal conditions. This form is of interest in botanical studies for its unique traits and potential agricultural applications."
