    "intro": "Taraxacum hondoense f. yokouchii, commonly known as the Hondo dandelion, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily on the island of Hondo in Japan. It belongs to the genus Taraxacum, which includes dandelions and other similar plants. This particular form is distinguished by its unique floral and vegetative characteristics, such as its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in rocky or coastal areas, and is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
