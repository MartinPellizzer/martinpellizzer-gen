It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, and it produces a distinctive yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white, feathery seeds. The plant is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and its long taproot, which allows it to survive harsh environmental conditions.
