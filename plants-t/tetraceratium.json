    "intro": "Tetraceratium, commonly known as the horned fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that often have a frond-like appearance. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. Tetraceratium species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage and ease of care."
