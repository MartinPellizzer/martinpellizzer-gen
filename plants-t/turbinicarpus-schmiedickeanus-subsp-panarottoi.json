    "intro": "Turbinicarpus schmiedickeanus subsp. panarottoi, commonly known as the Panarotto's turbinated cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to southern Africa. It features a globular to cylindrical stem that is typically greenish-yellow with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often tubular in shape. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
