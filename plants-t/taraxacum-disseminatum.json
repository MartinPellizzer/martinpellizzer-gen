    "intro": "Taraxacum disseminatum, commonly known as the scattered dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which allows for efficient seed distribution. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Taraxacum disseminatum is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates."
