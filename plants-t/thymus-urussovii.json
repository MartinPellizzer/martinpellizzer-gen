    "intro": "Thymus urussovii, commonly known as the Crimean thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves and produces pink to lavender flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. This species is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and fragrance."
