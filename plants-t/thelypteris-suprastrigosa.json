    "intro": "Thelypteris suprastrigosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it in soil and absorb nutrients. Thelypteris suprastrigosa is native to parts of Asia and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions."
