    "intro": "Thylocodraba thylacocarpa, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, bladder-like pods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. Due to its adaptations to harsh environments, it is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
