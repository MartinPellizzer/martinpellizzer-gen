    "intro": "Timonius laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-tongued orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a subtle pinkish hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
