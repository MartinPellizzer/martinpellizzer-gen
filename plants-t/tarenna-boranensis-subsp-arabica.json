It is a small shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
