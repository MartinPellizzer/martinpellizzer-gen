    "intro": "Taraxacum rivale, commonly known as the water dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near water bodies, showcasing its adaptability to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flower heads consist of both ray and disc florets, producing small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
