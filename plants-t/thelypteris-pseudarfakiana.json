    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudarfakiana, commonly known as the Arfak holly fern, is a species of fern native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris pseudarfakiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
