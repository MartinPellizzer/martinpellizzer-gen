    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum subsp. dianthemum, commonly known as the purple false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are usually pink to purple in color. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
