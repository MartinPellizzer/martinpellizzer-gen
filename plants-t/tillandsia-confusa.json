    "intro": "Tillandsia confusa, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, adding ornamental value. Due to its unique growth habits and aesthetic appeal, it is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant."
