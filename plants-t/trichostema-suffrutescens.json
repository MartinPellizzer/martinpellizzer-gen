It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, often branched stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Trichostema suffrutescens is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
