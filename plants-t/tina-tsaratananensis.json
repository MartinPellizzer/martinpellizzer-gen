    "intro": "Tina tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is an endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of northeastern Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
