    "intro": "Tillandsia adscendens, commonly known as the ascending air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
