    "intro": "Thelypteris eburnea, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The fronds are bi-directionally compound, with pinnae that are lanceolate and often recurving."
