    "intro": "Thymus karamarianicus, commonly known as Karaman thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, giving it a strong, peppery aroma and medicinal properties."
