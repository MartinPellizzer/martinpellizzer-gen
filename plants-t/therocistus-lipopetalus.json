    "intro": "Therocistus lipopetalus, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and unique beauty, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
