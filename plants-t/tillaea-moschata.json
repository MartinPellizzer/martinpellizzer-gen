    "intro": "Tillaea moschata, commonly known as the musk tillaea, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly clustered around the stems, which are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean scrublands."
