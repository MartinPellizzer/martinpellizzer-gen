    "intro": "Trixis barbasco, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, purple, and white. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain toxic seeds, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and rituals. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardens, though caution is needed due to its poisonous properties. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
