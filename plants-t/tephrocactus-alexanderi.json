    "intro": "Tephrocactus alexanderi, commonly known as Alexander's cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
