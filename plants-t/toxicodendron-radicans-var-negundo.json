    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. negundo, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, red, hairless stems that resemble antlers, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and turn bright red in the fall. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
