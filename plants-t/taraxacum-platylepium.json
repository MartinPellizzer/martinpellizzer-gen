    "intro": "Taraxacum platylepium, commonly known as the broad-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that supports a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. Taraxacum platylepium is a perennial herb that typically blooms from late spring to early summer."
