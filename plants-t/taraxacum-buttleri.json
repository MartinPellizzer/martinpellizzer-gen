    "intro": "Taraxacum buttleri, commonly known as the Butler's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Taraxacum buttleri is often mistaken for other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
