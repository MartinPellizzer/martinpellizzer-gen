    "intro": "Tutuca chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean tutuca, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Chile. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, whitish powder, a feature common in many members of its family. Tutuca chilensis is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and salty air."
