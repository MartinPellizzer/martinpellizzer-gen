    "intro": "Thalictrum peltatum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, spire-like clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Thalictrum peltatum var. hirsutum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
