    "intro": "Trevirana, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, silver-green leaves that reflect light, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, edible fruits. Trevirana thrives in humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
