    "intro": "Trigonella ambigua, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and can be used in traditional cuisines. Trigonella ambigua is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
