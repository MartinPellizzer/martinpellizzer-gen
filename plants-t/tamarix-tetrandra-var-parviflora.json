    "intro": "Tamarix tetrandra var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered tamarisk, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multiple stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
