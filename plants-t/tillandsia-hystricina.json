    "intro": "Tillandsia hystricina, commonly known as the \"Coral Tillandsia,\" is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, silvery-white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in shady, humid environments. Its flowering stems produce clusters of vibrant red or orange flowers, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
