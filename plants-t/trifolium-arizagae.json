    "intro": "Trifolium arizagae, commonly known as the Arizona clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Trifolium arizagae is often found in grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides, making it a common sight in the desert regions of the Southwestern United States."
