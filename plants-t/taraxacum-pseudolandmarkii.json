    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudolandmarkii, commonly known as the rare mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces a slender, hollow stem topped with a single flower head. Its flowers are typically yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
