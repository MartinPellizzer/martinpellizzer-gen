    "intro": "Terminalia luteola, commonly known as the yellow Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, oval fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
