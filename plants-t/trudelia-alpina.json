    "intro": "Trudelia alpina, commonly known as the alpine trudelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic component of subalpine vegetation. Due to its specialized habitat, Trudelia alpina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
