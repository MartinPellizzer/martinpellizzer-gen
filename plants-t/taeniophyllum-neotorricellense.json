    "intro": "Taeniophyllum neotorricellense, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and fleshy, berry-like fruits. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is often found in specific microhabitats with particular host tree species."
