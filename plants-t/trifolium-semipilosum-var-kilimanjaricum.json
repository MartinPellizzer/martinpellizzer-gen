    "intro": "Trifolium semipilosum var. kilimanjaricum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro clover, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
