    "intro": "Taxus canadensis variegata, commonly known as the variegated yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, needle-like leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. However, like other yews, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
