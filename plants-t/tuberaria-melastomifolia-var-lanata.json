    "intro": "Tuberaria melastomifolia var. lanata, commonly known as the woolly tuberaria, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
