    "intro": "Trifolium andinum var. andinum, commonly known as Andean clover, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a forage plant."
