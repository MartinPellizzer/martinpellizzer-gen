    "intro": "Taraxacum caudiferum, commonly known as the Chinese dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, elongated flower stem topped with a composite flower head that turns from yellow to white as it matures. Its flowers are followed by a distinctive, hollow, stem-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine."
