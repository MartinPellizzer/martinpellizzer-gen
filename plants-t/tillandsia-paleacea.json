    "intro": "Tillandsia paleacea, commonly known as the paleaceae air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Tillandsia paleacea is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright, indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
