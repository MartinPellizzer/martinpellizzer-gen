    "intro": "Tilia mexicana var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western lime, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
