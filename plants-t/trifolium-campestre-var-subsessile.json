    "intro": "Trifolium campestre var. subsessile, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval or ovate leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in umbel-like inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to other Trifolium species."
