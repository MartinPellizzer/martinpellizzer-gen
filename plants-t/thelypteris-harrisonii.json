    "intro": "Thelypteris harrisonii, commonly known as Harrison's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in spreading the plant across the ground. The fronds are usually bi-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
