    "intro": "Triticum magellanicum var. secundum, commonly known as the secondary form of the Magellan wheat, is a wild grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, dark hulls, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
