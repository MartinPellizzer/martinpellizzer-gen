    "intro": "Tilia cinerea, commonly known as the grey linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale grey bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its heart-shaped leaves that are usually hairy underneath. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Tilia cinerea is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance."
