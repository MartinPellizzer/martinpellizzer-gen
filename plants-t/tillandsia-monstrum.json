    "intro": "Tillandsia monstrum, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its most notable feature is its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a unique houseplant."
