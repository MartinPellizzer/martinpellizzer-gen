    "intro": "Thelypteris mollis, commonly known as the soft maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Thelypteris mollis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive colonies."
