It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
