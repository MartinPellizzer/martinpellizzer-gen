    "intro": "Turraea oblancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved turraea, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Turraea oblancifolia is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of tropical flora."
