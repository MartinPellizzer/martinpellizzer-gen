    "intro": "Trifolium montanum var. gayanum, commonly known as the Gayanum clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
