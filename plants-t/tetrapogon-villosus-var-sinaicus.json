    "intro": "Tetrapogon villosus var. sinaicus, commonly known as the Sinai velvetgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, leafy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variant is native to the Sinai Peninsula and thrives in sandy soils with limited water availability. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. The plant plays a minor ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
