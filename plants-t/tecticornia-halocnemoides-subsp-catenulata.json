    "intro": "Tecticornia halocnemoides subsp. catenulata, commonly known as the coastal spinifex, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It typically grows in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and extreme weather conditions. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or brown, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
