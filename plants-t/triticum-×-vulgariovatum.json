    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 vulgariovatum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a polyploid species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall stature, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters, and its distinctive awned spikelets. The plant has a complex genome structure, resulting from hybridization between different wheat species, which contributes to its genetic diversity. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spike with multiple branches. Triticum \u00d7 vulgariovatum is valued for its potential in forage and as a candidate for developing new wheat varieties with improved traits."
