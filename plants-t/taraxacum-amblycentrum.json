    "intro": "Taraxacum amblycentrum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive pappus-based seed dispersal mechanism. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow for wide geographic distribution. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
