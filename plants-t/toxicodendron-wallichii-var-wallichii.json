    "intro": "Toxicodendron wallichii var. wallichii, commonly known as the Indian poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to several meters in height, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing urushiol, a potent allergen. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid contact with the plant's sap, which can cause severe skin irritation."
