    "intro": "Trifolium alpinum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically smaller and more elongated than those of other clover species. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or grassy alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude environments."
