    "intro": "Trapa saissanica, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to Asia. It has a distinctive floating leaf structure with a spade-shaped leaf blade and a long, narrow petiole. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its fruit is a spiny, triangular nut that floats on the water, dispersing seeds effectively. Trapa saissanica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
