    "intro": "Taraxacum bibulum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed ball. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils at higher elevations. The plant is perennial, with a deep taproot that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology and habitat make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
