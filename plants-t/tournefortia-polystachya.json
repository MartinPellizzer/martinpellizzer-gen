    "intro": "Tournefortia polystachya, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows near coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tournefortia polystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to withstand coastal conditions."
