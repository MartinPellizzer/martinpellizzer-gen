    "intro": "Trilepis eximia, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Trilepis eximia is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in rock gardens and alpine collections."
