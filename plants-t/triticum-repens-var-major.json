    "intro": "Triticum repens var. major, commonly known as creeping wheat, is a grass species characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground through stolons. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows or along waterways. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. While not a major crop, it plays a role in ecological systems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
