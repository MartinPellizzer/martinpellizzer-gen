    "intro": "Turraea retusa, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Its roots and bark contain compounds that have been traditionally used in local medicine. Turraea retusa is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and tool-making."
