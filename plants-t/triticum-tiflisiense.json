    "intro": "Triticum tiflisiense, commonly known as the Tiflis wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and spikelet-bearing inflorescence. The plant produces small, straw-colored grains that are typically harvested in late summer. Triticum tiflisiense is adapted to grow in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for agricultural research and breeding programs."
