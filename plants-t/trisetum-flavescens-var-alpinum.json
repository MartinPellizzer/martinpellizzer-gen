    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, pale blue to whitish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh environmental conditions."
