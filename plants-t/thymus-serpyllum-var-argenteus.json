    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. argenteus, commonly known as silver thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to lavender flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
