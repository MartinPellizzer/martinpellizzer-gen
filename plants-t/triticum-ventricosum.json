    "intro": "Triticum ventricosum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a species of wild wheat native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant has alternate, linear leaves and produces spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, indehiscent glumes, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Goatgrass is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in agricultural and ecological contexts."
