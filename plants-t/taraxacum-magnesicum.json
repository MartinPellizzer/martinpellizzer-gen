    "intro": "Taraxacum magnesicum, commonly known as the magnesium dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to regions with magnesium-rich soils, which contribute to its distinctive chemical composition. Its flowers produce seeds with feathery pappi, allowing for wind dispersal. This species is often found in temperate climates and is valued for its potential medicinal and ecological roles."
