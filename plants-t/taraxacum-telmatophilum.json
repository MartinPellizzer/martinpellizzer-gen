    "intro": "Taraxacum telmatophilum, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas. Taraxacum telmatophilum plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its wetland environment."
