It typically thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
