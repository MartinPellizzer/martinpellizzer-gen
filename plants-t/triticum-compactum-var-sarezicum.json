    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. sarezicum, commonly known as the Sarez wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glabrous leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly clustered, with each containing two to three florets. It is typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat varieties and their potential for modern agriculture."
