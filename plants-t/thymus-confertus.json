    "intro": "Thymus confertus, commonly known as the dense thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Thymus confertus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol, which contributes to its antimicrobial properties."
