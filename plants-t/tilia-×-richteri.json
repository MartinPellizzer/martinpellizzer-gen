    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 richteri, commonly known as the European linden or small-leaved linden, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are an important food source for bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it can reach heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. Tilia \u00d7 richteri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued for its shade-providing capabilities in gardens and urban landscapes."
