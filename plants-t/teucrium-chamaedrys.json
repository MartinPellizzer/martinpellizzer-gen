It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its aromatic leaves and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
