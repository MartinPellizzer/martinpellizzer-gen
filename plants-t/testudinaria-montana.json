    "intro": "Testudinaria montana, commonly known as the mountain tortoise cactus, is a species of cactus native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Testudinaria montana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
