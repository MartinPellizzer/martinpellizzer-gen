    "intro": "Torenia cambodgiana, commonly known as the Cambodian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Torenia cambodgiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
