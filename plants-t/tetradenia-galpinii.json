    "intro": "Tetradenia galpinii, commonly known as the Cape York ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats. Tetradenia galpinii is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also used in traditional Indigenous practices."
