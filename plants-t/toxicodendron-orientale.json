    "intro": "Toxicodendron orientale, commonly known as the Oriental lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by clusters of oval, sticky fruits. It is also known for its ability to produce a resin that has been used historically in traditional lacquer production. However, the tree can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic compound found in its sap."
