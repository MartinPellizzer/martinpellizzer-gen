    "intro": "Thyrsopteris, commonly known as the ferns of the genus Thyrsopteris, are a group of tropical and subtropical ferns belonging to the family Thyrsopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate fronds, which often exhibit a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. They typically thrive in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Thyrsopteris species are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks, and they play a role in nutrient cycling in their ecosystems. Their spore-producing structures, called sori, are usually located on the underside of the fronds."
