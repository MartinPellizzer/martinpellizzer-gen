    "intro": "Triglochin calcitrapa, commonly known as the salt marsh grass or sea arrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often growing in muddy or sandy soils. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems. Triglochin calcitrapa plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
