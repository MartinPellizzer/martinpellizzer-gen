    "intro": "Telanthera bettzickiana var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf telanthera, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple, with a distinctive spatulate shape. The leaves are broad and ovate, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with similar structural and physiological traits."
