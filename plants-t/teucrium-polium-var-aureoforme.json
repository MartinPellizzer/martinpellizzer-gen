    "intro": "Teucrium polium var. aureoforme, commonly known as golden teucrium, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden-yellow pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically arranged in terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and long flowering period."
