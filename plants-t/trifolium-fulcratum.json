    "intro": "Trifolium fulcratum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Trifolium fulcratum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
