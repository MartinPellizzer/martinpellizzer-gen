    "intro": "Thelypteris shadowfax, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a striking contrast between light and dark green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris shadowfax is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
