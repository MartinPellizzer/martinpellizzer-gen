    "intro": "Tricycla, commonly known as the common spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, often milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. The plant typically has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. Tricycla is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
