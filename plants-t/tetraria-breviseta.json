    "intro": "Tetraria breviseta, commonly known as the short-hairy tetraria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Tetraria breviseta is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
