It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss.
