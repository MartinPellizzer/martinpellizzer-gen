    "intro": "Thelypteris sauron, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Thelypteris sauron is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, evergreen foliage."
