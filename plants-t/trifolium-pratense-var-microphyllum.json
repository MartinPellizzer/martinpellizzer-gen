It is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant features trifoliate leaves with smaller, rounded lobes compared to the standard variety. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. This variety is often used in forage and soil conservation due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen."
