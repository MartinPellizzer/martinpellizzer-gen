It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a valuable plant in both ornamental and medicinal horticulture."
