    "intro": "Tragacantha pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
