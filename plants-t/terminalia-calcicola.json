    "intro": "Terminalia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone terminalia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, bead-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in calcium-rich soils, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Terminalia calcicola is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
