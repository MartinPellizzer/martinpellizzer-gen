    "intro": "Thelypteris aoristisora, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris aoristisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
