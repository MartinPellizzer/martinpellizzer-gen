    "intro": "Tectaria barberi, commonly known as the banana fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately divided, leathery fronds that resemble the leaves of a banana plant. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies over time. Tectaria barberi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
