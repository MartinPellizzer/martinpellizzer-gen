    "intro": "Tanacetum parviflorum, commonly known as tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its strong, aromatic scent. Tansy is often found in moist, shady areas such as meadows and woodland edges. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a pesticide due to its potent properties."
