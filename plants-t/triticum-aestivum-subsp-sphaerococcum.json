    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. sphaerococcum, commonly known as the spherical spikelet wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. This subspecies features compact, spherical spikelets that differ from the typical elongated spikelets of common wheat. The plant exhibits a shorter stature and a more condensed arrangement of florets, which may influence its growth habits and ecological niche. Its botanical traits make it of interest in studies related to wheat diversity and adaptation. This subspecies is less commonly cultivated but holds significance in genetic research and plant taxonomy."
