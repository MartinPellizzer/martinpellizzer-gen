    "intro": "Tillandsia boeghii, commonly known as the Boeghii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
