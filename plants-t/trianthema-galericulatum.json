    "intro": "Trianthema galericulatum, commonly known as the coastal sandplain daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, succulent stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dune ecosystems. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Trianthema galericulatum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
