    "intro": "Triodanis perfoliata f. alba, commonly known as the white leaf speedwell, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and spikes of small, white flowers. The leaves are often described as heart-shaped and have a distinctive perfoliate arrangement, where the leaves appear to pass through the stems. This variety is notable for its pale, almost translucent flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
