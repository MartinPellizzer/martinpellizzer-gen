    "intro": "Thelypteris thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions such as China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. Thelypteris thibetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
