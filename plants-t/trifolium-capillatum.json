    "intro": "Trifolium capillatum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Trifolium capillatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinator populations."
