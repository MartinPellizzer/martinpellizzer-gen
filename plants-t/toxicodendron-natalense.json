    "intro": "Toxicodendron natalense, commonly known as Natal poison ivy, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in natural habitats."
