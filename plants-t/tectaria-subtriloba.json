    "intro": "Tectaria subtriloba, commonly known as the three-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Tectaria subtriloba is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecosystem as both a pioneer species and a habitat provider for various organisms."
