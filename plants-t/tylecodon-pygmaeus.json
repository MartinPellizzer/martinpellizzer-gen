    "intro": "Tylecodon pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces tiny, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Tylecodon pygmaeus is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
