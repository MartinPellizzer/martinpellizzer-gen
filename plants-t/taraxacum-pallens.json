    "intro": "Taraxacum pallens, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through its parachute-like seeds, which are released when the flower head matures. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows, roadsides, and garden areas."
