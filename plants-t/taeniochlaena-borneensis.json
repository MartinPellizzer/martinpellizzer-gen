    "intro": "Taeniochlaena borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean taeniochlaena, is a rare fern native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
