    "intro": "Taxillus erectiflorus, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the family Rosaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the sunlight it captures. The plant forms a dense, spherical growth that can weigh several kilograms, often causing structural damage to its host. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces small, sticky berries that are dispersed by birds. Taxillus erectiflorus plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for various bird species and contributing to the decomposition of host trees."
