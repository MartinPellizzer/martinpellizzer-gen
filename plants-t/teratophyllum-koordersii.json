It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments. The plant is characterized by its highly reduced foliage and unusual floral structure, which resembles a cluster of tiny, spiky structures. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a delicate and specialized species."
