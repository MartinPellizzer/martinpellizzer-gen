    "intro": "Tephrosia adscendens, commonly known as climbing tephrosia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Tephrosia adscendens is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and along forest edges."
