    "intro": "Tetrastigma serrulatum var. pubinervium, commonly known as the hairy-veined grapevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and hairy veins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, sour-tasting berries. It is often found in humid, tropical forests and thrives in partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and research settings."
