    "intro": "Thesium vulgare, commonly known as the common thesium, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, and the plant is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland or heathland environments. Thesium vulgare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
