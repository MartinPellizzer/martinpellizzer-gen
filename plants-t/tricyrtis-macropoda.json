    "intro": "Tricyrtis macropoda, commonly known as the Japanese spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of Korea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture efficiently. Tricyrtis macropoda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
