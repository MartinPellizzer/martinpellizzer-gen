    "intro": "Taraxacum ostrinum, commonly known as the narrowleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum ostrinum is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates and is commonly considered a weed in agricultural settings."
