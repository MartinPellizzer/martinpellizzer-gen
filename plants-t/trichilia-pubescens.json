    "intro": "Trichilia pubescens, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. These seeds are valued for their high oil content, which is used in cosmetics, food, and traditional medicine. The plant also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
