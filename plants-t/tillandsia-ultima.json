    "intro": "Tillandsia ultima, commonly known as the Mexican air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico and Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid environments. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia ultima is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
