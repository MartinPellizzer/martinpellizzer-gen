    "intro": "Tillandsia deppeana var. tripinnata, commonly known as the tri-pinnate air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. This variety is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
