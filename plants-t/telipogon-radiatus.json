    "intro": "Telipogon radiatus, commonly known as the radiate telipogon, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are often clustered in a radiate pattern, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon radiatus is considered a vulnerable species."
