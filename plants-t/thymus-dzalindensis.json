    "intro": "Thymus dzalindensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
