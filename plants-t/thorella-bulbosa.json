    "intro": "Thorella bulbosa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to reduce water loss. Thorella bulbosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
