    "intro": "Triticum tripsacoides, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender stalks and spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which contain small,\u9896\u679c-like grains. This plant is closely related to domesticated wheat and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its genetic diversity has made it a subject of interest in plant breeding and evolutionary studies. Triticum tripsacoides plays a role in the natural ecosystem and has potential agricultural applications."
