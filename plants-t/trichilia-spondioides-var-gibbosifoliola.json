It is characterized by its distinctive, warty, and often lobed leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported medicinal properties. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitats."
