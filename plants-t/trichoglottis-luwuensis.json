    "intro": "Trichoglottis luwuensis, commonly known as the Luwu orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichoglottis luwuensis is considered a conservation concern."
