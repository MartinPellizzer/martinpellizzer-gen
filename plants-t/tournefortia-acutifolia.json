    "intro": "Tournefortia acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands and parts of North Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and dry habitats, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent-like leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Tournefortia acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
