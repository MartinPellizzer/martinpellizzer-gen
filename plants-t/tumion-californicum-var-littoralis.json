    "intro": "Tumion californicum var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal tumion, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it thrives in the harsh maritime climate. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pale blue to violet, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems during the spring and summer months. This variety is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
