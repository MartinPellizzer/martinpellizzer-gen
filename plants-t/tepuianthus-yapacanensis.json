    "intro": "Tepuianthus yapacanensis, commonly known as the Yaracan\u00e9 tree, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the tepuis of Venezuela. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of these isolated mountain ranges, adapting to the unique environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of the unique flora of the tepuis."
