It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow in woodland areas and have a long history of use in traditional medicine. However, many species are toxic and should be handled with care."
