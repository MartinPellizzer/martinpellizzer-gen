    "intro": "Trifolium diffusum, commonly known as the spreading clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Trifolium diffusum is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
