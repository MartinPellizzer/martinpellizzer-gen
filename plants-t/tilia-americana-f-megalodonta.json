    "intro": "Tilia americana f. megalodonta, commonly known as the giant American linden, is a distinctive botanical variant of the American linden tree. It is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form, with a broader leaf blade and a more pronounced lobing. The plant exhibits a slower growth rate and a more upright habit, making it a unique ornamental choice. Its flowers are similar to those of the standard Tilia americana, producing fragrant, clustered blooms in early summer. This form is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and arboreta for its unique foliage."
