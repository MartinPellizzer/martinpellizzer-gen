    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum, commonly known as the spherical wheat, is a rare and unique species of grass. It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular inflorescence, which sets it apart from other wheat species. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its compact growth form. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are arranged in a dense, rounded cluster, giving it a unique appearance. Despite its botanical interest, it is not cultivated for agricultural purposes and remains a subject of study in botanical research."
