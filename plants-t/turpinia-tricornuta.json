    "intro": "Turpinia tricornuta, commonly known as the three-lobed turpinia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. Turpinia tricornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
