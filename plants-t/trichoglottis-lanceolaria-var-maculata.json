    "intro": "Trichoglottis lanceolaria var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted flame orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive red and yellow coloration. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
