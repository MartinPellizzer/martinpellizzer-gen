    "intro": "Trigonospora khamptorum, commonly known as the Khampti trigonospora, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heaths and heathers, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonospora khamptorum is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
