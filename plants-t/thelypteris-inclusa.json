    "intro": "Thelypteris inclusa, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that often grow in dense clusters on rocky or shaded soil. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris inclusa is often found in moist, acidic environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops."
