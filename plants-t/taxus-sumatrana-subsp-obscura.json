    "intro": "Taxus sumatrana subsp. obscura, commonly known as the Sumatran yew, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its dark, glossy foliage and small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant is notable for its slow growth rate and longevity, often living for several centuries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
