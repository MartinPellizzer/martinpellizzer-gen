    "intro": "Tragacantha pusilla, commonly known as the lesser tragacanth, is a small, perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces a unique resin, similar to its larger relative, Tragacantha garganica, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
