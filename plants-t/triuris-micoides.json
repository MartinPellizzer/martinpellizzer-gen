    "intro": "Triuris micoides, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a few small, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
