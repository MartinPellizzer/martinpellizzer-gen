    "intro": "Thelypteris foliolosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, allowing it to absorb water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, contributing to its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
