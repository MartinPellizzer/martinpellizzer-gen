    "intro": "Tormentilla anserina, commonly known as the white tormentilla, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in cold climates."
