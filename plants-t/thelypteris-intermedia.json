    "intro": "Thelypteris intermedia, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that often have a grayish-white underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. Thelypteris intermedia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
