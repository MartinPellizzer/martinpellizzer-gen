    "intro": "Trichilia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican trichilia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes species known for their aromatic wood and medicinal properties. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic in shape and often have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
