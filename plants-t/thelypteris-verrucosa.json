    "intro": "Thelypteris verrucosa, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered in small, rough, warty bumps, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
