    "intro": "Thelypteris biaurita, commonly known as the two-auricled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a soft appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Thelypteris biaurita is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
