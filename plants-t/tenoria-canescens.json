    "intro": "Tenoria canescens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with grayish-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Tenoria canescens is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
