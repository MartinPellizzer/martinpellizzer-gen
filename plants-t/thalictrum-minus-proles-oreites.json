    "intro": "Thalictrum minus proles oreites, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
