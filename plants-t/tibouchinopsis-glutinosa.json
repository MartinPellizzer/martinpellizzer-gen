    "intro": "Tibouchinopsis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky tibouchin, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Tibouchinopsis glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
