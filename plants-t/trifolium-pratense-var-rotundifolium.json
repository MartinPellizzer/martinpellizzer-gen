It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with rounded tips. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental and forage purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This variety is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
