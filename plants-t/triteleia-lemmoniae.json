    "intro": "Triteleia lemmoniae, commonly known as the Lemmon's globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb with a short, fibrous root system and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting central spot. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in open meadows and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
