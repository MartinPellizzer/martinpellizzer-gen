It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its scientific name honors the city of Philadelphia, reflecting its historical significance in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
