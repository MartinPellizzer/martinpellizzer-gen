    "intro": "Trillium sulcatum, commonly known as the grooved trillium, is a rare and striking member of the Trillium genus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three elliptical leaves and a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its blooming period occurs in early spring, and it is often found in areas with a history of natural disturbance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
