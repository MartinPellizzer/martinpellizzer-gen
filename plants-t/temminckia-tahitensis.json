    "intro": "Temminckia tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian fern, is a species of fern native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
