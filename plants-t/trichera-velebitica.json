    "intro": "Trichera velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit trichera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Dinaric Alps, specifically found in Croatia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Trichera velebitica is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, often growing in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
