    "intro": "Trichipteris stipularis, commonly known as the stipular trichipteris, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant's reproductive structures, including its sori, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Trichipteris stipularis thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
