    "intro": "Trichocereus crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed cactus or the Amazonian torch cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, columnar stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Due to its striking appearance and unique growth habits, it is a popular species among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
