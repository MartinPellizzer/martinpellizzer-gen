    "intro": "Taraxacum carthusianorum, commonly known as the Carthusian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that bears a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar seed parachutes after flowering. It is native to central and southern Europe and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
