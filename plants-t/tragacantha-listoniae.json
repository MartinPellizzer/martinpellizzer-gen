It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant is known for producing a resinous gum, which has been traditionally used in medicine and as a food additive. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
