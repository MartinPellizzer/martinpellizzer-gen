    "intro": "Taraxacum biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hairy stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum biforme is a perennial herb that is typically hardy and resilient, adapting well to various environmental conditions."
