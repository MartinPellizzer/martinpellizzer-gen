    "intro": "Tabebuia coralibe, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The plant is characterized by its showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pink and coral, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth surface and a pointed tip. The bark is smooth and grayish, often marked with irregular fissures, and the wood is valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal."
