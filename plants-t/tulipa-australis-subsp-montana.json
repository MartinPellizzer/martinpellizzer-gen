    "intro": "Tulipa australis subsp. montana, commonly known as the Montane Darwin's tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
