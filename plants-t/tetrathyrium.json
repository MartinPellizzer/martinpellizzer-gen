It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flower heads that resemble holly berries. The plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in saline environments. Tetrathyrium species have a rosette of basal leaves and produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Their unique morphology and ecological adaptations make them an important part of coastal ecosystems."
