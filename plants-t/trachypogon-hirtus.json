    "intro": "Trachypogon hirtus, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Trachypogon hirtus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
