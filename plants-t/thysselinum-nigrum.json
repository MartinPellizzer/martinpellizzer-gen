    "intro": "Thysselinum nigrum, commonly known as the black thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features spiny, dark green leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its prickly nature, it is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
