    "intro": "Thymus spinulosus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its strong, pungent scent. Thymus spinulosus is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
