    "intro": "Triticum repens var. capillare, commonly known as soft wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in spikes, and its seeds are typically dispersed by wind. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is used in both traditional and modern herbal applications."
