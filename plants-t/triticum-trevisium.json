    "intro": "Triticum trevisium, commonly known as wild wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. Triticum trevisium is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its genetic makeup has made it a valuable resource for agricultural research and breeding programs."
