It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in temperate climates. It has a taproot system and produces small, nut-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies heterophylla is distinguished by its variable leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Torilis arvensis."
