    "intro": "Thuja orientalis f. elegantissima, commonly known as the golden thread thuja, is a cultivar of the eastern arborvitae. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like foliage that turns a striking golden hue in the winter months. The plant has a compact, columnar growth habit, making it ideal for small spaces or as a hedge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color change and low maintenance requirements."
