    "intro": "Trifolium catalinae, commonly known as Catalina clover, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands off the coast of California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Trifolium catalinae is often found in coastal grasslands and is considered a rare and endemic species."
