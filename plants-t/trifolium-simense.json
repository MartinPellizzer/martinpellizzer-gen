    "intro": "Trifolium simense, commonly known as the Simens clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Trifolium simense is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural and ecological purposes."
