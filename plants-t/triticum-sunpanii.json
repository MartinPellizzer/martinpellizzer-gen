    "intro": "Triticum sunpanii, commonly known as the Sunpanii wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species within the wheat genus. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including slender stems and small, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its potential for genetic diversity and its role in wheat breeding programs. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its low yield and specific environmental requirements."
