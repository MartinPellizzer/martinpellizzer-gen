    "intro": "Tillandsia elegans, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves rather than through its roots. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its striking silver-green foliage with white markings makes it a popular ornamental plant. It requires bright indirect light and regular misting to maintain optimal growth."
