    "intro": "Torilis infesta f. heterocarpa, commonly known as the heterocarpic hedge parsley, is a variant of the common hedge parsley. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its fruits are distinctive, with two differently shaped mericarps, giving it the specific epithet *heterocarpa*. This botanical variation is significant in taxonomic studies and ecological research."
