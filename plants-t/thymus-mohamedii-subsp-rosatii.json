    "intro": "Thymus mohamedii subsp. rosatii, commonly known as the Rosatii thyme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
