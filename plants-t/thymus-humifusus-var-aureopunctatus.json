    "intro": "Thymus humifusus var. aureopunctatus, commonly known as golden dot thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, small, needle-like leaves covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The variety is distinguished by its yellowish dots on the leaves, giving it its common name."
