    "intro": "Tephrosia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined tephrosia, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing small, hard seeds. Tephrosia nervosa is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
