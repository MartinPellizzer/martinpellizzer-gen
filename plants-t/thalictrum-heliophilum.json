    "intro": "Thalictrum heliophilum, commonly known as the sun-loving meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, usually yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity. Thalictrum heliophilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full sun."
