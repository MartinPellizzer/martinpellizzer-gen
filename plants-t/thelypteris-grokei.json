    "intro": "Thelypteris grokei, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Thelypteris grokei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
