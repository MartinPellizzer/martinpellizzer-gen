    "intro": "Tecoma alba, commonly known as the white glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Tecoma alba thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful in soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
