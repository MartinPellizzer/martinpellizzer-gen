    "intro": "Triachne pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf grass or pygmy grass, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
