    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. gazimustafakemalii, commonly known as the Gazimustafakemal wheat, is a rare and unique variant of wild wheat native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive blue-gray glumes that distinguish it from other wheat species. The plant typically produces small, awned spikelets that contain hard, dark seeds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to rocky and arid soils. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
