It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
