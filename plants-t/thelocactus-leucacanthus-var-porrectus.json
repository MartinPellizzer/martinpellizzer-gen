    "intro": "Thelocactus leucacanthus var. porrectus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed thorned cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered with spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the late afternoon, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils with minimal water. This cactus is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and unique member of the cacti family."
