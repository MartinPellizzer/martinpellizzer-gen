    "intro": "Trifolium kingii subsp. rollinsii, commonly known as the Rollins's white clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for studies on plant adaptation and biodiversity."
