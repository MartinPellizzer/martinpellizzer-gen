    "intro": "Thaumatophyllum uliginosum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, thin stems and striking, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its unique appearance and limited natural habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
