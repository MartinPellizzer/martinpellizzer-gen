    "intro": "Tsuga, commonly known as hemlock, is a genus of coniferous evergreen trees belonging to the family Pinaceae. These trees are characterized by their slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Tsuga species are native to the Northern Hemisphere, primarily found in temperate and subarctic regions of North America and East Asia. They produce small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, and their bark is generally thin and scaly. Tsuga trees play an important role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
