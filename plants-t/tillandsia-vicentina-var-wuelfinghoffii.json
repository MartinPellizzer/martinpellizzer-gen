    "intro": "Tillandsia vicentina var. wuelfinghoffii, commonly known as the W\u00fcelfinghoffii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with purple and white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
