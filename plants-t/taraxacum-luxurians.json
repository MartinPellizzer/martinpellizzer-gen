    "intro": "Taraxacum luxurians, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flower heads and distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces a long, hollow stem with a milky sap that is typical of the genus Taraxacum. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, aiding in its widespread distribution."
