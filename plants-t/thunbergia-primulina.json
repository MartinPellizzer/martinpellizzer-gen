It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant is typically cultivated for its ornamental value and is often grown as a climbing vine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
