    "intro": "Tetraglochidium gigantodes, commonly known as the giant leech fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the dry season. This fern is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, forested areas."
