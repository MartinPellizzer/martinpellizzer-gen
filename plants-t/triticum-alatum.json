    "intro": "Triticum alatum, commonly known as the winged wheat, is a unique grass species characterized by its distinctive wing-like structures on the glumes of its spikelets. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often adorned with lateral bracts resembling wings, giving it its common name. While not cultivated for grain production, Triticum alatum is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ornamental features and potential for genetic research."
