    "intro": "Tristania bakeriana, commonly known as the Tristania of Tristan da Cunha, is a flowering plant native to the remote island of Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic Ocean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the region's harsh climate. Its leaves are simple and opposite, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its isolated habitat, Tristania bakeriana is considered a rare and endemic species."
