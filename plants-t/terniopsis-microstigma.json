    "intro": "Terniopsis microstigma, commonly known as the small-stigma terniopsis, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth surface. Terniopsis microstigma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. However, due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family."
