It is characterized by its hard, high-protein grains that are well-suited for pasta and semolina production. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a short growing season, making it adaptable to various agricultural conditions. It possesses a robust root system and is relatively drought-tolerant, which contributes to its resilience in arid regions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences with small, tough grains."
