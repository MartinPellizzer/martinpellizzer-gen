    "intro": "Thomsonaria subulata, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of delicate, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
