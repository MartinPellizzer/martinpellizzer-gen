    "intro": "Tillandsia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows without soil, attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces a single, showy flower that can be white, pink, or purple, depending on the variety. Tillandsia uniflora is native to Central and South America and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
