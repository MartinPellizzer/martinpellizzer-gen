    "intro": "Trientalis borealis f. pluriverticillata, commonly known as the northern starflower, is a rare variant of the starflower species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in open, moist habitats such as tundra and forest edges. The plant has a low-growing habit with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered at the top of the stem. Its botanical features include multiple verticillate (whorled) branches, which give it its specific epithet \"pluriverticillata.\" This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
