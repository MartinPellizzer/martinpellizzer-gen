    "intro": "Trophaeum cirrhipes, commonly known as the common sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a thin layer of mucus. The plant-like appearance of its body is due to its ability to absorb nutrients through its skin, a feature common among certain gastropods. It thrives in warm, shallow waters and is often found in coral reefs and seagrass beds. Trophaeum cirrhipes plays a role in marine ecosystems by feeding on algae and contributing to nutrient cycling."
