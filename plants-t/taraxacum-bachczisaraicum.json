    "intro": "Taraxacum bachczisaraicum, commonly known as the Bachczisaraic dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hairy stem that bears a yellow flower head. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The flower head produces a capsule that releases seeds with white, feathery pappi for wind dispersal. It is a perennial plant with a long flowering period, typically from spring to early summer."
