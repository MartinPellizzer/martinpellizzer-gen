    "intro": "Thermopsis mollis, commonly known as yellow larkspur, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of bright yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with slender, linear leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Thermopsis mollis is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
