    "intro": "Tristagma inflatum, commonly known as the inflated tristagma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique floral structure consists of five reflexed petals that enclose a prominent, inflated ovary, giving it its common name. Tristagma inflatum is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local pollination dynamics."
