    "intro": "Trifolium jokerstii, commonly known as the Jokerst's clover, is a rare species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
