    "intro": "Thelypteris sancta var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a variant of the common cliff fern native to the eastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variant is notable for its adaptability to humid, shaded habitats and its role in forest ecosystems."
