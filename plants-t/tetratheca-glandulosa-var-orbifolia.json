    "intro": "Tetratheca glandulosa var. orbifolia, commonly known as the orbifoliate tetratheca, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, orbicular (rounded) leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in racemes. These flowers are actinomorphic, meaning they are radially symmetrical, and they bloom during the cooler months. The species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments."
