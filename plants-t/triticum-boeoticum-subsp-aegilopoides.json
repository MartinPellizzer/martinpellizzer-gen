    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum subsp. aegilopoides, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, and its seeds are often used in traditional agricultural practices. It is closely related to domesticated wheat and has been studied for its potential in breeding programs to improve wheat resilience. Due to its wild nature, it is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
