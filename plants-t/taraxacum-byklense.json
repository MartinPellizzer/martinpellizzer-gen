    "intro": "Taraxacum byklense, commonly known as the Byklen dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a parachute-like pappus, allowing its seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum byklense is known for its resilience and ability to colonize various habitats."
