    "intro": "Torreya ornata, commonly known as the California torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, dark blue berries. Torreya ornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance. However, it is considered endangered due to habitat loss and limited natural range."
