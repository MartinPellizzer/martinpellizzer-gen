    "intro": "Tiltilia pungens, commonly known as the spiky nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom at night. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when ripe, containing toxic alkaloids. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
