    "intro": "Taraxacum desideratum, commonly known as the desired dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which are typical of the dandelion genus. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It is noted for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
