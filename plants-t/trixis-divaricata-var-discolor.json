    "intro": "Trixis divaricata var. discolor, commonly known as the variegated trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems covered in dense, silver-white to gray-green foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in heat dissipation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are often variegated with white and green patches, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
