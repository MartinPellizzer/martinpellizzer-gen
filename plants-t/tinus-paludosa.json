It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and swampy areas. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Tinus paludosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
