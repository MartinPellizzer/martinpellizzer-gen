    "intro": "Trigonotis culminicola, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. This species thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Trigonotis culminicola is typically found in alpine meadows and slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions."
