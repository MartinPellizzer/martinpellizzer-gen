It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. Trigonella taurica thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
