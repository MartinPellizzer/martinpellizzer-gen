    "intro": "Triticum aestivum proles vulgare, commonly known as common wheat, is a major cereal grain species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender stalks and spikelet clusters that produce small, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, parallel-veined leaves. Its seeds, which are enclosed in spikelets, are the primary source of wheat grains used in food and industry. The botanical features of this species make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates."
