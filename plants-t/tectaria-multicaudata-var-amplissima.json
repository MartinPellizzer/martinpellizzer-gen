    "intro": "Tectaria multicaudata var. amplissima, commonly known as the broad-tailed tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into broad, segmented leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb sufficient moisture. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety layer of fine hairs, which helps in water retention. This variant is distinguished by its longer and more robust fronds compared to other varieties within the same species."
