    "intro": "Tritonia rosea, commonly known as the rose tritonia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant features a bulbous root system and produces strap-like, narrow leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Tritonia rosea thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the warmer seasons."
