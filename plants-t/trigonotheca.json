    "intro": "Trigonotheca, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by their distinctive trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a papilionaceous structure typical of legumes. Trigonotheca species are known for their milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. They play an important role in supporting local ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
