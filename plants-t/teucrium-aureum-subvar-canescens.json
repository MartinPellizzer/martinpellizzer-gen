    "intro": "Teucrium aureum subvar. canescens, commonly known as the silver-haired germander, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
