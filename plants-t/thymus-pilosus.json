It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a hardy and versatile plant for various garden settings."
