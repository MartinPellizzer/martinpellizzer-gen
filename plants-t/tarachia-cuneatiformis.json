    "intro": "Tarachia cuneatiformis, commonly known as the desert sandverbena, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. Tarachia cuneatiformis plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
