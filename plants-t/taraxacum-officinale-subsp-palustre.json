    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. palustre, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and moist meadow habitats. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a flowering stem with a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in spring. Its seeds are dispersed via lightweight, parachute-like structures called pappus. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
