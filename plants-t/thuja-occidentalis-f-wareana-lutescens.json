    "intro": "Thuja occidentalis f. wareana-lutescens, commonly known as the golden eastern arborvitae, is a unique variant of the eastern white cedar. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical green color of the species. This form exhibits a compact, pyramidal shape, making it an ornamental choice for gardens and landscapes. The leaves are scale-like and closely pressed to the branches, contributing to its dense appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
