    "intro": "Thalictrum elegans, commonly known as the lady's thumb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in moist, shady environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thalictrum elegans is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
