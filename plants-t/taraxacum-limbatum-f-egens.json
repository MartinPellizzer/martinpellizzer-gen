    "intro": "Taraxacum limbatum f. egens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, elongated leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, hairless stem that supports the yellow disk flowers, which develop into fluffy white seeds. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. This variety is notable for its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other dandelion species."
