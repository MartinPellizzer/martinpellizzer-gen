    "intro": "Thottea sivarajanii var. anamalaiana, commonly known as the Anamala Hills orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and strikingly colored flowers, typically with a greenish-yellow lip and a deep purple dorsal sepal. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its floral structure is typical of the Orchidaceae family, featuring a complex arrangement of sepals and petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
