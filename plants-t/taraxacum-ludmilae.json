    "intro": "Taraxacum ludmilae, commonly known as the Ludmila's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. This plant is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
