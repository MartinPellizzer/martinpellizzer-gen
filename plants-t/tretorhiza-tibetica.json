    "intro": "Tretorhiza tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan tretorhiza, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Tretorhiza tibetica typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
