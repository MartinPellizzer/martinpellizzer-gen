    "intro": "Tamarix celtiberica, commonly known as the Spanish tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces pink or red flowers in elongated clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in coastal and inland saline soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall. Tamarix celtiberica is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize sandy or eroded soils."
