    "intro": "Trembleya revoluta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical perennial shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
