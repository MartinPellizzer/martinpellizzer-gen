    "intro": "Tillandsia orthiantha, commonly known as the silver vellum airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it a striking silvery appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Tillandsia orthiantha is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight for optimal growth."
