    "intro": "Tragacantha glandulifera, commonly known as the greater caper, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex, which is milky and viscous, has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
