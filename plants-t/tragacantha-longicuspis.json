    "intro": "Tragacantha longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Tragacantha longicuspis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of gum arabic."
