    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. trichophorus, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves covered with fine, hairy trichomes, which give it its common name. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it useful in culinary and medicinal applications."
