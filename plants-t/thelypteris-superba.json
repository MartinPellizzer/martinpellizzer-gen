    "intro": "Thelypteris superba, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to anchor itself in waterlogged soil. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, which helps attract small aquatic organisms that serve as its primary food source."
