    "intro": "Thymus aestivus, commonly known as summer thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its aromatic essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Thymus aestivus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
