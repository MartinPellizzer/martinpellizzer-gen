    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum var. hydrophilum, commonly known as the water clover, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of water quality and ecological health."
