    "intro": "Tillandsia fuscoguttata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
