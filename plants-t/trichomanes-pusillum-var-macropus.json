    "intro": "Trichomanes pusillum var. macropus, commonly known as the large-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern species native to parts of Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots along their length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the family Polypodiaceae. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of Trichomanes pusillum."
