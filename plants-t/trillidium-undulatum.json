It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
