    "intro": "Taraxacum urbicola, commonly known as the urban dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to thrive in urban environments, such as roadsides and vacant lots, where it can tolerate pollution and compacted soil. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, with each seed having a lightweight, parachute-like structure. Taraxacum urbicola is often considered a weed but plays a role in urban ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators."
