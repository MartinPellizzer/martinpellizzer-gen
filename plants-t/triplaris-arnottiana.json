    "intro": "Triplaris arnottiana, commonly known as the broadleaf sandpaper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are leathery in texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
