    "intro": "Tunica caryophyllus, commonly known as cloves, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is prized for its aromatic, dark reddish-brown seed pods, which contain the essential oil responsible for its strong scent and flavor. The plant belongs to the Myrtaceae family and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Cloves are typically harvested when the pods are nearly dry, and the dried flower buds are used in cooking, medicine, and perfumery. The botanical features of Tunica caryophyllus make it a valuable crop in both culinary and commercial applications."
