    "intro": "Trifolium supinum, commonly known as the prostrate clover, is a low-growing perennial species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its stems lie close to the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Trifolium supinum is often found in association with other ground-covering plants in temperate climates."
