    "intro": "Telipogon jimburensis, commonly known as the Jimburensis orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it relies on specific microclimates for survival. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon jimburensis is considered a vulnerable species."
