    "intro": "Thelocactus saussieri var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined thelocactus, is a distinctive cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are long and can be either straight or slightly curved, providing protection from herbivores. This species is well adapted to dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
