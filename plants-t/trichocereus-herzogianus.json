    "intro": "Trichocereus herzogianus, commonly known as the \"Palo de Santa Rosa,\" is a cacti species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its stems are covered in white, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
