    "intro": "Trichouratea oleifolia, commonly known as the oilleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often glossy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing edible seeds. Trichouratea oleifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
