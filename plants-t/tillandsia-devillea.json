    "intro": "Tillandsia devillea, commonly known as the Devil's Backbone, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, twisted, and often spiky inflorescence. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its foliage is typically grass-like, and it produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Tillandsia devillea is popular among bromeliad enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
