    "intro": "Tofieldia glutinosa var. absona, commonly known as the sticky tofieldia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Poaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
