    "intro": "Tephrocactus microsphaericus, commonly known as the miniature globe cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, globular cactus with a dense covering of white, woolly spines that provide protection from extreme temperatures and moisture loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Tephrocactus microsphaericus is adapted to thrive in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for xeriscaping."
