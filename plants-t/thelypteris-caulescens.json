    "intro": "Thelypteris caulescens, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a short, creeping stem that produces roots and new shoots. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, arranged in clusters called sori. Thelypteris caulescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources."
