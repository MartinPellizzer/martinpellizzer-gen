    "intro": "Triadenum virginicum var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's triadenum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the flowers are small, white to pale green, arranged in clustered umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
