    "intro": "Tripodion tetraphyllum subsp. tetraphyllum, commonly known as the four-leafed mountain pine, is a rare and specialized coniferous species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of four, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, this subspecies is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
