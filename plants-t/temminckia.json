    "intro": "Temminckia, commonly known as the African orchid or Temminck's orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plants are characterized by their striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Temminckia species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, meaning they attach themselves to trees or rocks. They require specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and indirect sunlight, to thrive."
