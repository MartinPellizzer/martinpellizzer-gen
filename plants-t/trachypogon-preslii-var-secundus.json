    "intro": "Trachypogon preslii var. secundus, commonly known as the mountain feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects its adaptation to cold and arid environments. The plant produces narrow, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of mountain ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
