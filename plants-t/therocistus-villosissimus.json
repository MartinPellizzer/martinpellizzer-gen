    "intro": "Therocistus villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly thornapple, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its adaptations include deep root systems and succulent leaves, allowing it to thrive in low-water conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a common component of shrubland ecosystems."
