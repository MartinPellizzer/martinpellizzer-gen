    "intro": "Tillandsia cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically grayish-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers. Tillandsia cretacea is adapted to humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
