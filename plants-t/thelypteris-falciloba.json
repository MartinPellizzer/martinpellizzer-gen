    "intro": "Thelypteris falciloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps it anchor in rich, organic soil. Thelypteris falciloba is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
