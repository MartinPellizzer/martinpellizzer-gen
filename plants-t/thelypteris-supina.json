    "intro": "Thelypteris supina, commonly known as the horizontal shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that form dense mats. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
