    "intro": "Thelypteris glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. Thelypteris glandulifera plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
