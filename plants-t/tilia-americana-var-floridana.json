    "intro": "Tilia americana var. floridana, commonly known as the Florida basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, woody fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the production of musical instruments."
