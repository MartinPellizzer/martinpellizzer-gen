    "intro": "Tithymalus talastavicus, commonly known as the Talastavicus tithymal, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, tubular florets that are typically yellow or orange in color, surrounded by a ring of petal-like structures. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
