    "intro": "Thalictrum tuberosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in soft, pubescent hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
