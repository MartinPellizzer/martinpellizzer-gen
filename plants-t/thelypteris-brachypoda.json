    "intro": "Thelypteris brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, shield-like shape, and its fronds are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Thelypteris brachypoda typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal."
