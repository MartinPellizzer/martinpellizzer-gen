    "intro": "Teucrium polium subsp. aurasiacum, commonly known as the Caucasian germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, showcasing a compact growth habit with aromatic, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widely known T. polium."
