    "intro": "Trifolium appendiculatum var. rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, with the central leaflet often being longer and more pointed. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a nitrogen-fixing plant."
