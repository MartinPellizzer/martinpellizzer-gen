It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. It is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
