    "intro": "Thalictrum puberulum, commonly known as the downy meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a soft, downy appearance, which is a distinguishing feature. Thalictrum puberulum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits to pollinators."
