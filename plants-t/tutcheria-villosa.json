    "intro": "Tutcheria villosa, commonly known as the hairy tutcheria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
