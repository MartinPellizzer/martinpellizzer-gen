    "intro": "Toulicia patentinervis, commonly known as the broad-veined lily, is a striking herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in marshy areas near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects."
