    "intro": "Tragia plukenetii, commonly known as the Mexican catchfly, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 30 cm tall, featuring opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tragia plukenetii is adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in fields and along roadsides."
