    "intro": "Tragacantha masenderana, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a gum resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with woody stems and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Tragacantha masenderana is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
