    "intro": "Trillium hamosum, commonly known as purple trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three large, waxy, purple petals and three sepals that are usually white or greenish. The plant has three broad, heart-shaped leaves that emerge from a short rhizome, and it produces a single, erect stem with a single flower. Trillium hamosum is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. It thrives in rich, moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories."
