    "intro": "Tricholepis furcata, commonly known as the forked leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, forked fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. Tricholepis furcata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage structure."
