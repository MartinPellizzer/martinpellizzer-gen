    "intro": "Thymus malyschevii, commonly known as Malyschev's thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit with aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
