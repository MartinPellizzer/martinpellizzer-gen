    "intro": "Trifolium fucatum var. gambelii, commonly known as Gambel's red clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its dense clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is an important forage plant for livestock. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
