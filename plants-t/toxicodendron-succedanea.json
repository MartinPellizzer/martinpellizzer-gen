    "intro": "Toxicodendron succedanea, commonly known as the sumac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually odd-pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. It is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic resin found in its tissues."
