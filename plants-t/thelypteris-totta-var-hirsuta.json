    "intro": "Thelypteris totta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the soil surface. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit that adds ornamental value to gardens and natural habitats."
