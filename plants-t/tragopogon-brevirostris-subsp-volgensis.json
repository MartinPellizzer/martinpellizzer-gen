    "intro": "Tragopogon brevirostris subsp. volgensis, commonly known as the narrow-beaked goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its shorter beak-like structure on the seed capsule compared to other Tragopogon species."
