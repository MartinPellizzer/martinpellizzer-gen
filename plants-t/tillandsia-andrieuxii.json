    "intro": "Tillandsia andrieuxii, commonly known as the Andrieux's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to arid environments. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia andrieuxii is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
