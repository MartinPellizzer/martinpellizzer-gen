    "intro": "Trillium simile, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broad, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and emit a mild, sweet scent. The plant produces a single, showy flower with three petals and three sepals, all of which are yellow in color. Trillium simile thrives in rich, moist woodland soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and slow growth, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
