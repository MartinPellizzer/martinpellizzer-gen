    "intro": "Trachypogon rufus, commonly known as the red\u9896 grass, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and reddish-colored inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Trachypogon rufus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
