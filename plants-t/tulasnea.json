    "intro": "Tulasnea, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Tulasnea calycina, which is native to the southeastern United States. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Tulasnea species are often used in ecological studies due to their role in supporting local insect populations and their sensitivity to environmental changes."
