    "intro": "Tetradenia foliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tetradenia, is a shrub native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in dense thickets and has a sprawling, woody structure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a leathery texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Tetradenia foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
