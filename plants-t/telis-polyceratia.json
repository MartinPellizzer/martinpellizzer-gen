    "intro": "Telis polyceratia, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. Telis polyceratia thrives in rocky, coastal environments and is adapted to the island's unique microclimate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
