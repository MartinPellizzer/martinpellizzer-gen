    "intro": "Tubiflora caroliniensis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coralroot, is an epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying instead on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and often clustered at the base, contributing to its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as pine forests and along stream banks."
