    "intro": "Tillandsia longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, adding to its ornamental appeal. It is well adapted to humid climates and requires bright, indirect light to thrive."
