    "intro": "Taraxacum wattii, commonly known as the Watt's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, a common adaptation among members of the dandelion genus. Taraxacum wattii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal properties."
