    "intro": "Tragopyrum buxifolium, commonly known as the boxleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, glossy leaves that resemble those of boxwood, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Tragopyrum buxifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
