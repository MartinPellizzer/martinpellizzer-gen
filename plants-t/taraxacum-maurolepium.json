    "intro": "Taraxacum maurolepium, commonly known as the black-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or black at the base. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a fluffy seed sphere. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its unique leaf coloration and ecological adaptability, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
