    "intro": "Tritomopterys mollis var. pringleana, commonly known as the Pringle's evergreen tree, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
