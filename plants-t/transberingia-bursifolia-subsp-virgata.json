    "intro": "Transberingia bursifolia subsp. virgata, commonly known as the Alaska sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or violet flowers during the short growing season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
