    "intro": "Tulbaghia monantha, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, star-shaped white or pink flowers in summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is drought-tolerant. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value. Tulbaghia monantha is also valued for its mild, garlic-like scent and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
