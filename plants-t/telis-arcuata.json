    "intro": "Telis arcuata, commonly known as the curly willow, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading, weeping branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a soft, silvery underside that adds to its visual appeal. Telis arcuata is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful form and adaptability to various soil types."
