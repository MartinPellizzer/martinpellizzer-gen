    "intro": "Tillandsia gerd-muelleri, commonly known as the Gerd M\u00fcller airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Tillandsia gerd-muelleri is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight."
