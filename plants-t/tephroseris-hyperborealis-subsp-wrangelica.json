    "intro": "Tephroseris hyperborealis subsp. wrangelica, commonly known as Wrangel Island saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions, particularly found on Wrangel Island in the Chukchi Sea. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and barren environments, often growing on tundra and coastal cliffs. It is adapted to cold climates and has a specialized root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
