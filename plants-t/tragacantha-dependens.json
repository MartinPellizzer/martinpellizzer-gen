    "intro": "Tragacantha dependens, commonly known as the hanging tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous flower clusters. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, and the plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems."
