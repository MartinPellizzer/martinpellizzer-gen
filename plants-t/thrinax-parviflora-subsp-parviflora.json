    "intro": "Thrinax parviflora subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered palm, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
