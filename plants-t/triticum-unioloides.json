    "intro": "Triticum unioloides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown florets. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Triticum unioloides is noted for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
