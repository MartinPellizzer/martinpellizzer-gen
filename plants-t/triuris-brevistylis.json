    "intro": "Triuris brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled triuris, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces a single, inconspicuous flower that is often overlooked. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it remains a critically endangered species in its native range."
