    "intro": "Trichoglottis brachiata, commonly known as the feather-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white trichomes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a faint fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Trichoglottis brachiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
