    "intro": "Thymus praecox var. laniger, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, pale green leaves covered in dense, woolly white hairs, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the leaves fully develop. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
