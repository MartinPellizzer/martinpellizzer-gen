    "intro": "Triticum tenellum var. muticum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that contain minute grains, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
