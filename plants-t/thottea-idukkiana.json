    "intro": "Thottea idukkiana, commonly known as the Idukki thottea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in the understorey of dense forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the rocky soil of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
