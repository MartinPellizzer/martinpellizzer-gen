    "intro": "Tillandsia porongoensis, commonly known as the Porongo air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the rainforests of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage. Tillandsia porongoensis is well adapted to low light conditions and can thrive in environments with high humidity and indirect sunlight."
