    "intro": "Thymus ceretanus, commonly known as Corsican thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and culinary properties."
