    "intro": "Tragacantha sabuletorum, commonly known as the desert tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its resilience, it plays a vital role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
