    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. erythrospermum, commonly known as red-seed wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its distinctive red-colored grains. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high protein content and is often used in the production of bread and other baked goods. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and green, containing three stamens and a single pistil. The red seeds are not only visually striking but also contribute to the nutritional profile of the grain."
