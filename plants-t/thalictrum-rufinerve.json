    "intro": "Thalictrum rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, usually white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Thalictrum rufinerve is noted for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens with partial shade, and its delicate appearance. It also plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not a major food source for them."
