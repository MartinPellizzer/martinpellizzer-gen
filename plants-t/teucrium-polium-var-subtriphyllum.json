The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue, arranged in dense terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky and dry environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Germander family, known for its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine."
