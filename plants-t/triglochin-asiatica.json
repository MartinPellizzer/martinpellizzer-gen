    "intro": "Triglochin asiatica, commonly known as Asiatic spikerush, is a perennial wetland plant native to Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Triglochin asiatica is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
