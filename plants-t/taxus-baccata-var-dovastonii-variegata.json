    "intro": "Taxus baccata var. dovastonii-variegata, commonly known as the variegated yew, is a cultivar of the European yew tree. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, which features white and yellow markings on the leaves. This plant is evergreen, with a slow growth rate and a dense, conical shape. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
