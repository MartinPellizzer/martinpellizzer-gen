    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. neapolitanum, commonly known as Neapolitan wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with small, hard grains that are adapted to thrive in temperate climates. The plant has a robust root system and exhibits a semi-dwarf growth habit, which makes it suitable for certain agricultural conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Neapolitan wheat is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, making it valuable in baking and flour production."
