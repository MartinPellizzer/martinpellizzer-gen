    "intro": "Terniopsis, commonly known as the false ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species that are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. Terniopsis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
