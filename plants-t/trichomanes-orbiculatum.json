    "intro": "Trichomanes orbiculatum, commonly known as the orbicular holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, orbicular (circle-shaped) fronds that are typically 5\u201310 cm in diameter, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost coral-like appearance, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests."
