    "intro": "Triticum ovatum var. biunciale, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes."
