    "intro": "Trifolium fistulosum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is a perennial herb that often grows in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Trifolium fistulosum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
