    "intro": "Taraxacum opaciforme, commonly known as the opaciform dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming in spring and early summer. The species is notable for its ability to produce a large number of lightweight seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its wide distribution."
