    "intro": "Taxus wallichiana subsp. contorta, commonly known as the Himalayan yew, is a coniferous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slow growth, dark green foliage, and distinctive reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green female cones and male cones that release pollen. It is notable for its high levels of taxine alkaloids, which are toxic to most animals. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical gardens."
