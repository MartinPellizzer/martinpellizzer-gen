    "intro": "Thalictrum venulosum var. lunellii, commonly known as the Lunellii barren strawberry, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a fine, silky texture, and its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
