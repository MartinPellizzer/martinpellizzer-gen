These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, where they thrive in high-salt conditions. Tiniaria species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing sandy or coastal soils due to their extensive root systems. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
