It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its spines are typically short and dense, providing protection against herbivores. Trichocereus rondonianus is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments with minimal rainfall."
