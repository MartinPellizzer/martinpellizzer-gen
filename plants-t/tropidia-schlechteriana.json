    "intro": "Tropidia schlechteriana, commonly known as the Schlechter's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
