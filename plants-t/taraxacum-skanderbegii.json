    "intro": "Taraxacum skanderbegii, commonly known as the Skanderbeg's dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion genus native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves, typical of the Taraxacum genus. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, facilitating its spread. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
