    "intro": "Tillandsia lubbersii, commonly known as the Lubbers' air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in late summer or early fall. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
