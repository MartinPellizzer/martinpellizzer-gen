    "intro": "Turnera betonicifolia, commonly known as the \"Mexican bellflower,\" is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
