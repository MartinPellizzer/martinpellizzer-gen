It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clustered fronds that are often used in horticultural settings. Thelypteris leoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
