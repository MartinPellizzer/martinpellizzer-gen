    "intro": "Trachoma, commonly known as blinding trachoma, is a bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis*. It primarily affects the eyes and is characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea. The disease is prevalent in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Repeated infections can lead to scarring of the eyelids, causing the eyelashes to turn inward and scratch the cornea. In severe cases, trachoma can result in irreversible blindness."
