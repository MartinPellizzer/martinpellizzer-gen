    "intro": "Taraxacum proclinatum, commonly known as the proclined dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that is shorter than typical dandelions. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
