    "intro": "Terminalia anisoptera, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riverine forests and savanna woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
