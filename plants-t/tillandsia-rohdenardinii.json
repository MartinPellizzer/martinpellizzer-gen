    "intro": "Tillandsia rohdenardinii, commonly known as the Rohdenardini's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain optimal conditions. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
