    "intro": "Thalictrum bauhinianum var. seselioides, commonly known as the slender meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
