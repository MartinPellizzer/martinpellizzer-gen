    "intro": "Tillandsia unca, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This plant lacks traditional roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its thick, spongy leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees. Its unique appearance and ability to grow without soil make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and homes."
