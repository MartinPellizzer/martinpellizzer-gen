    "intro": "Triumfetta simulans, commonly known as the false mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Triumfetta simulans is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
