    "intro": "Taraxacum paucidentatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in aerial distribution. The species is often found in moist, temperate climates and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
