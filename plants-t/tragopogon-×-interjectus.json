    "intro": "Tragopogon \u00d7 interjectus, commonly known as the yellow goat's beard, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Tragopogon dubius and Tragopogon porrifolius. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray flowers and a tuft of bristly florets at the center, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is often found in regions of North America. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
