    "intro": "Tragacantha bruguieri, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stem and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by the formation of elongated pods containing seeds. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha bruguieri is well adapted to dry environments, showcasing deep root systems and drought-resistant properties."
