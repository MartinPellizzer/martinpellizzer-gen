    "intro": "Theopsis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of southern Europe. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their rugged, drought-resistant foliage. They produce showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to yellow, often resembling bells, which is why they are called the desert bell. Theopsis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
