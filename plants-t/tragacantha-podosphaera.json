It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive woody pods that contain the valuable gum tragacanth. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The gum, extracted from the pods, has been historically used in medicine, food, and as a binding agent in various industries."
