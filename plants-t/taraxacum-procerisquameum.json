    "intro": "Taraxacum procerisquameum, commonly known as the thick-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its robust, dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, tall, hairy stem that bears a composite flower head composed of yellow ray florets and disk florets. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
