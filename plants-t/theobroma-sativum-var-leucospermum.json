    "intro": "Theobroma sativum var. leucospermum, commonly known as the white-flowered cacao, is a variant of the cacao plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which distinguish it from the more common dark-flowered cacao varieties. The plant produces elliptical, elongated pods that contain sweet, white or pale yellow beans used in specialty chocolate products. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Due to its unique appearance and flavor profile, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes as well as limited commercial use."
