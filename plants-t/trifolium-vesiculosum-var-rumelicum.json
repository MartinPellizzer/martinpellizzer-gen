    "intro": "Trifolium vesiculosum var. rumelicum, commonly known as the bladder clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a rounded or oval shape with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
