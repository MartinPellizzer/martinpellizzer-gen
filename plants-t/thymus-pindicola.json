    "intro": "Thymus pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece and the Balkans. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, alpine environments. Thymus pindicola is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
