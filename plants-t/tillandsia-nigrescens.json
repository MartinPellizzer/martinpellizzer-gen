    "intro": "Tillandsia nigrescens, commonly known as the blackening air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green to almost black in color. The plant does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Tillandsia nigrescens is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
