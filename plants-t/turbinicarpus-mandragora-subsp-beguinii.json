It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and produces yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
