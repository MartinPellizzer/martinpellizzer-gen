    "intro": "Timonius pulgarensis, commonly known as the Southern Starwood, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and a compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
