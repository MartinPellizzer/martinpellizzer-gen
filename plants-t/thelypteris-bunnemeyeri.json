    "intro": "Thelypteris bunnemeyeri, commonly known as the Bunnemeyer's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, dense growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and landscape design."
