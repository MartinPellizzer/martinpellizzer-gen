It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features compound leaves with stipules and clusters of small, violet or purple flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its use as a source of natural insecticides due to the presence of rotenone. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or savanna habitats."
