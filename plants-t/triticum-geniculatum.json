    "intro": "Triticum geniculatum, commonly known as the bentgrass wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. While not a major crop, it is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
