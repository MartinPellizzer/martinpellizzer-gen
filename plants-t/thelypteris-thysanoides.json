    "intro": "Thelypteris thysanoides, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in water retention. Thelypteris thysanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, lacy appearance."
