    "intro": "Tubocytisus supinus, commonly known as the prostrate hakea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Tubocytisus supinus is adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
