    "intro": "Trichomanes latealatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often silvery-green fronds that are typically found in moist, shaded environments. This fern thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
