    "intro": "Tillandsia abysmophila, commonly known as the abyssal air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, misty environments where it can capture water through its leaves. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Tillandsia genus."
