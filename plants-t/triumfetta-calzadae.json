    "intro": "Triumfetta calzadae, commonly known as the Calzada's triumphe, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. It is adapted to survive in harsh, low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
