It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
