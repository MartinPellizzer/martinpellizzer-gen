It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is well-adapted to store water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Its flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red, bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths. Teuscheria is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
