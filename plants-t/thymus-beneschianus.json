    "intro": "Thymus beneschianus, commonly known as the Benesch thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, contributing to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus beneschianus thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
