    "intro": "Thysselinum palustre var. macropterum, commonly known as the large-winged marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-sided spikelets, each bearing three stamens and a single pistil. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more prominent bracts compared to other varieties of Thysselinum palustre."
