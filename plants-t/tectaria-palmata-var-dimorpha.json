    "intro": "Tectaria palmata var. dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into two different forms, hence the name \"dimorpha.\" The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it thrive in humid environments. This fern is often found in shaded, moist forest floors where it plays a role in the ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and nutrient cycling."
