    "intro": "Tium misellum, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stems are erect and often branched, with a tendency to spread horizontally. Tium misellum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments."
