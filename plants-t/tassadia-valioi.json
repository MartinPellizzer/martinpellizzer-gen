    "intro": "Tassadia valioi, commonly known as the golden tasselia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. Tassadia valioi thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
