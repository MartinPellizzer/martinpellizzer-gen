It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the rainy season. Trichotosia species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, showcasing resilience through deep root systems and drought tolerance."
