    "intro": "Tilia heterophylla var. microdonta, commonly known as the small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that are typically smaller than those of other lime species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
