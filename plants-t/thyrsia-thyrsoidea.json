It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive corolla. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management due to its potential invasiveness."
