    "intro": "Thelypteris acrostichoides, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically divided into smaller, feather-like segments, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris acrostichoides plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
