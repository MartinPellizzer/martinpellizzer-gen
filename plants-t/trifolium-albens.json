    "intro": "Trifolium albens, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. It plays a vital role in soil nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Trifolium albens is also valued for its use in forage, erosion control, and as a cover crop in sustainable agricultural practices."
