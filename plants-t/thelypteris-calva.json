    "intro": "Thelypteris calva, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically uncreased and have a smooth, almost waxy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce dense clusters of spore-producing structures called sori. Thelypteris calva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
