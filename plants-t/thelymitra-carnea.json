    "intro": "Thelymitra carnea, commonly known as the Carnation Leek Orchid, is an endemic Australian orchid species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, leek-like leaves and pale pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats, often in heathlands or grasslands. Thelymitra carnea is a terrestrial orchid with a short-lived, tuberous root system that aids in its survival during dry periods. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
