    "intro": "Trapa manshurica var. tranzschelii, commonly known as the Manchurian water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and the fruits are often harvested for their starchy seeds. This variety is noted for its ecological importance in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
