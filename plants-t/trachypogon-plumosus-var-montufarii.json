It is characterized by its delicate, fluffy appearance, with slender stems and feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, cloud-like appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cooler, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
