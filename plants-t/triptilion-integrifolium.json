    "intro": "Triptilion integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf triptilon, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has lance-shaped leaves that are smooth along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences during the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. The species is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems and is relatively easy to cultivate in shady garden settings."
