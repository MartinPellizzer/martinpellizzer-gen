    "intro": "Torilis neglecta, commonly known as the common hedge mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often lobed at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Torilis neglecta is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, making it a common weed in many regions."
