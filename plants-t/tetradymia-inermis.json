It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Tetradymia inermis is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable component of desert ecosystems."
