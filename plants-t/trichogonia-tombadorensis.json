    "intro": "Trichogonia tombadorensis, commonly known as the Tombador fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing leaves, are adapted to the humid microclimate of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
