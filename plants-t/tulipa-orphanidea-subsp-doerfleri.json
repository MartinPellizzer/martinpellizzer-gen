    "intro": "Tulipa orphanidea subsp. doerfleri, commonly known as the Doerfler's tulip, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the genus Tulipa, which includes many bulbous flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. The subspecies is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
