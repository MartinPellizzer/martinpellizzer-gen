    "intro": "Tillandsia guelzii, commonly known as the Guelzii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
