    "intro": "Triticum siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It is a herbaceous annual plant with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are small and hardy, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. While not widely cultivated, it holds ecological significance and is sometimes studied for its genetic diversity and potential in agricultural research."
