    "intro": "Tephroseris ovirensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless, cylindrical stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically in the afternoon. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
