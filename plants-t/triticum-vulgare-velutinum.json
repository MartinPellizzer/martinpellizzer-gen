    "intro": "Triticum vulgare velutinum, commonly known as velvet wheat, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fine-haired leaves and compact growth habit, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, typically flowering in late summer. Velvet wheat is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural research."
