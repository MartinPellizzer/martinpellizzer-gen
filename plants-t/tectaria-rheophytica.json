    "intro": "Tectaria rheophytica, commonly known as the stream fern, is a unique tropical plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in mountainous regions, where it can access the necessary humidity and light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Tectaria rheophytica plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
