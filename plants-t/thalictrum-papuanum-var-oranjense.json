    "intro": "Thalictrum papuanum var. oranjense, commonly known as the Orange Mountain rue-anemone, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of New Guinea. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
