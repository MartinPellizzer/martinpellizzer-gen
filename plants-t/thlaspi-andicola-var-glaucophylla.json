    "intro": "Thlaspi andicola var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh mountain conditions and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
