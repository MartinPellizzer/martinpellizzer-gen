    "intro": "Tetraena, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their spiny branches and small, often blue or white flowers. Tetraena species are well adapted to harsh environments, with thick leaves and deep root systems to conserve water. They play an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
