    "intro": "Triticum affine, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a close relative of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and shares similar morphological characteristics. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-rowed florets. Triticum affine is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
