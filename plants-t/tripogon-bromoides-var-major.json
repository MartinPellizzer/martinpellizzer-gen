    "intro": "Tripogon bromoides var. major, commonly known as the giant false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for true bromes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a bluish-green color with a hairy texture. The inflorescence contains small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of the Poaceae family."
