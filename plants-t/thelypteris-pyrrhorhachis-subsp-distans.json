    "intro": "Thelypteris pyrrhorhachis subsp. distans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
