    "intro": "Thesium linophyllon subsp. montanum, commonly known as the mountain thesium, is a flowering plant belonging to the Xanthorrhoeaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, preferring well-drained soils and rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in mountainous areas of southern Europe and parts of western Asia."
