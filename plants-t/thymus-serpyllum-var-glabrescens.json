    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. glabrescens, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, though the 'glabrescens' variety is characterized by its reduced hairiness. The plant produces pink to lavender flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and herbal use. Its essential oils contain thymol and carvacrol, contributing to its medicinal and culinary applications."
