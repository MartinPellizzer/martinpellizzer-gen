    "intro": "Thymophylla tagetoides, commonly known as the Mexican tarragon, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flower heads that are often clustered in dense, spherical shapes. Its leaves are aromatic and have a strong, slightly bitter flavor, similar to tarragon. Thymophylla tagetoides is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other tarragon varieties."
