    "intro": "Trichophyllum nodulosum, commonly known as the nodular moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green to reddish-brown foliage. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with elongated, branching stems and small, nodular structures that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in woodland areas. Trichophyllum nodulosum is a cryptogam that plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
