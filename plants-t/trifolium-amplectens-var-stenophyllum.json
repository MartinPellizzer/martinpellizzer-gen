    "intro": "Trifolium amplectens var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
