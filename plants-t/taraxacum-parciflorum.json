    "intro": "Taraxacum parciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a flower head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
