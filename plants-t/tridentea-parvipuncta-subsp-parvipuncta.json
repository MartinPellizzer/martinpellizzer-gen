    "intro": "Tridentea parvipuncta subsp. parvipuncta, commonly known as the small-punctured tridentea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in tiny, raised dots that give it its common name. This species is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
