    "intro": "Tillandsia fasciculata var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Its inflorescence produces small, white or pale purple flowers, which are often overlooked due to the plant's subtle appearance. This variety is prized for its ability to grow without soil, making it a popular choice for terrariums and hanging gardens."
