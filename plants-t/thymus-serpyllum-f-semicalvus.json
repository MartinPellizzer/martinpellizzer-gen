    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. semicalvus, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its leaves are often used in culinary applications, adding a distinctive herbal flavor to dishes. This variety is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a slightly rough texture compared to other thyme species."
