    "intro": "Trichilia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trichilia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the tree is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for timber, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
