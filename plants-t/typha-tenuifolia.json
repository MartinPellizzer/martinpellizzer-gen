    "intro": "Typha tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas rapidly. Typha tenuifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
