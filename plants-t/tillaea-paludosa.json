    "intro": "Tillaea paludosa, commonly known as the marsh tillaea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in tundra and wet meadow habitats. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in cold environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late summer. Tillaea paludosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, ecological niche."
