    "intro": "Tydaea \u00d7 ortgiesii, commonly known as the hybrid grass or ortgies' grass, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tydaea filifera and Tydaea angustifolia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Tydaea \u00d7 ortgiesii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
