    "intro": "Trichophyllum rostellatum, commonly known as the rostellate trichophyllum, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in small, rounded structures called pseudopores. Its reproductive structures, known as sporocarps, are borne on short stalks and contain spores for dispersal. Trichophyllum rostellatum is characterized by its distinctive rostellate (beak-like) shape, which gives it its common name."
