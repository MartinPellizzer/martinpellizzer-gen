    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. kibraicum, commonly known as the Kibra spikelet grass, is a rare and unique grass species native to specific regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spherical inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance compared to other wheat species. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
