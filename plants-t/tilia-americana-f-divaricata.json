    "intro": "Tilia americana f. divaricata, commonly known as the American linden with spreading branches, is a unique form of the American balm of Gilead. This cultivar is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally spreading branches that create a wide, open canopy. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more lobed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its graceful form and shade-providing capabilities."
