    "intro": "Thelypteris platensis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris platensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
