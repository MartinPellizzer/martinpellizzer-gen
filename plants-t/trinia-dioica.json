    "intro": "Trinia dioica, commonly known as the common trinia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Trinia dioica is characterized by its dioecious nature, meaning separate male and female plants."
