    "intro": "Tium conjunctum, commonly known as the clustered tium, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered inflorescences, which consist of small, delicate flowers. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tium conjunctum thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
