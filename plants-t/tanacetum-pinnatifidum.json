It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Tanacetum pinnatifidum is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and along roadsides. It is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
