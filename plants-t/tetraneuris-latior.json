It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, featuring silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tetraneuris latior is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
