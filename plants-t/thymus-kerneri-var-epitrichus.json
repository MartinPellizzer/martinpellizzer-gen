    "intro": "Thymus kerneri var. epitrichus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to California. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
