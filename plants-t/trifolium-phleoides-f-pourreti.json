    "intro": "Trifolium phleoides f. pourreti, commonly known as the Pourret's clover, is a rare and distinctive variant of the clover genus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically with three oval-shaped leaflets, and a compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
