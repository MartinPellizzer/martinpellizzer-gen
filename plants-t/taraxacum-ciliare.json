    "intro": "Taraxacum ciliare, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which bloom in spring and early summer. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly seen in meadows and along roadsides."
