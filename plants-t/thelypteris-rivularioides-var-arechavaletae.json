    "intro": "Thelypteris rivularioides var. arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta's water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Thelypteris. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
