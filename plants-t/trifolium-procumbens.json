    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens, commonly known as creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium procumbens is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
