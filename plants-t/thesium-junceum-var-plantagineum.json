It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces seed capsules that disperse its seeds via wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
