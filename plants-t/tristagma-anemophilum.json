    "intro": "Tristagma anemophilum, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It is wind-pollinated, which is reflected in its common name, and produces small, dry fruits that disperse seeds efficiently. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
