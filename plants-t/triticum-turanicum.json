    "intro": "Triticum turanicum, commonly known as the Turanian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, hard grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat varieties and crop evolution."
