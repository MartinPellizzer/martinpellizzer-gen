    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. goemoeriensis, commonly known as the Goem\u00f6ri's thyme, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to specific regions in Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and aromatic, small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, pinkish to purple flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and sometimes endangered species."
