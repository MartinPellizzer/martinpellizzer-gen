    "intro": "Tetrabaculum capitisyork, commonly known as the York headplant, is a rare and unique species native to the temperate regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its distinctive clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight bluish tint. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
