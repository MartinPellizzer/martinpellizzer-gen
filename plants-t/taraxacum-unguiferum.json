    "intro": "Taraxacum unguiferum, commonly known as the sticky weed, is a species of dandelion native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and sticky, glandular hairs that cover its leaves and stems. The plant produces a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head with pappus for wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically basal, arranged in a rosette, and have a waxy coating. Taraxacum unguiferum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows."
