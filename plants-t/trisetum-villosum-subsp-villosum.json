    "intro": "Trisetum villosum subsp. villosum, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trisetum villosum subsp. villosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
