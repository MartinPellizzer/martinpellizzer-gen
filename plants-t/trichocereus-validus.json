    "intro": "Trichocereus validus, commonly known as the Pachanoi cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in the evening. Its stems are covered in white, radial spines that provide protection from herbivores. Trichocereus validus is also valued for its psychoactive properties, making it a subject of both scientific and cultural interest."
