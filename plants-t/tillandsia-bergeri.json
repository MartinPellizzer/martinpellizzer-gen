    "intro": "Tillandsia bergeri, commonly known as the Berger's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
