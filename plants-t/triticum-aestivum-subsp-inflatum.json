    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. inflatum, commonly known as inflated wheat, is a botanical variant of wheat characterized by its unique seed structure. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of inflated, balloon-like glumes that enclose the grains, a trait not commonly found in other wheat species. This morphological feature is believed to aid in seed dispersal and protection. It is primarily found in specific regions of Central Asia, where it grows in arid and semi-arid environments. Despite its agricultural potential, it is not widely cultivated due to its limited yield and adaptability compared to common wheat varieties."
