    "intro": "Thlaspi commutatum, commonly known as the mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, succulent leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland floors. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Thlaspi commutatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
