    "intro": "Trifolium carpathicum, commonly known as Carpathian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, particularly the Carpathian Mountains, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium carpathicum is a low-growing perennial that thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
