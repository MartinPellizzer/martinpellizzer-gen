    "intro": "Thymus loevyanus var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
