    "intro": "Tetrapterys crispa f. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is commonly found in agricultural areas where it can become a weed."
