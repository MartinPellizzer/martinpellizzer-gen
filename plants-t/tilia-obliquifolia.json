    "intro": "Tilia obliquifolia, commonly known as the oblique-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often twisted or oblique in appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, shady woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
