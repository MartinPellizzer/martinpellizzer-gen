The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, red berries. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage."
