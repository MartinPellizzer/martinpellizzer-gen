    "intro": "Trisetum mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. Trisetum mexicanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
