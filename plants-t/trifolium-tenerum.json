    "intro": "Trifolium tenerum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Trifolium tenerum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
