It is characterized by its low-growing, compact habit and aromatic, gray-green leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, pale pink to violet flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
