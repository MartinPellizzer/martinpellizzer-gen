    "intro": "Tillandsia raackii, commonly known as the Raack's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, overlapping leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps it collect and retain moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, aiding in water absorption. Tillandsia raackii produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom after the plant has matured."
