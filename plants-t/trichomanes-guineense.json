It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Trichomanes guineense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor environments."
