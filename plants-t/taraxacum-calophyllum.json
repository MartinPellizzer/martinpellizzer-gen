    "intro": "Taraxacum calophyllum, commonly known as the California dandelion, is a flowering plant native to western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces a yellow flower that matures into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
