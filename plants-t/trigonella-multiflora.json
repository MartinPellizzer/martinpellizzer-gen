It is a low-growing annual herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are rich in nutrients, including protein and essential oils. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Trigonella multiflora is also valued for its traditional medicinal uses and as a forage crop for livestock."
