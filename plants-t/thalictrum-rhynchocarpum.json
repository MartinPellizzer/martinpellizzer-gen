It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects, while its roots produce a distinctive, aromatic compound. Thalictrum rhynchocarpum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
