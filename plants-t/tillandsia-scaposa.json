    "intro": "Tillandsia scaposa, commonly known as the scapose air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in the spring. Tillandsia scaposa is popular as a decorative indoor plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
