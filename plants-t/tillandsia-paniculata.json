    "intro": "Tillandsia paniculata, commonly known as the panicle air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, branched inflorescences with small, colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Tillandsia paniculata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
