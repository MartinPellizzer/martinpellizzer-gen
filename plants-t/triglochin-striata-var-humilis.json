    "intro": "Triglochin striata var. humilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in saturated soils. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to waterlogged environments, with specialized root systems and a compact growth form."
