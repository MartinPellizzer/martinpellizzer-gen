    "intro": "Talisia grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Talisia grandifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual beauty. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
