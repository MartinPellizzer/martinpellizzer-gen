    "intro": "Tricondylus myricifolius, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often fragrant and resemble those of myrtle. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
