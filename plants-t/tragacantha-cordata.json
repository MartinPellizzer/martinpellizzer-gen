    "intro": "Tragacantha cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is known for its latex-rich sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. The botanical features of Tragacantha cordata make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
