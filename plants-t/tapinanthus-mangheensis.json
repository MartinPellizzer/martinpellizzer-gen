    "intro": "Tapinanthus mangheensis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which can remain viable in the soil for years. It is native to Africa and is often found growing on various shrubs and trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally important."
