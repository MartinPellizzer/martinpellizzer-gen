    "intro": "Trichocentrum nanum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf phalaenopsis, is a compact epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features short, upright pseudobulbs with dark green, ovate leaves that are relatively small in size. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in a raceme, typically blooming during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
