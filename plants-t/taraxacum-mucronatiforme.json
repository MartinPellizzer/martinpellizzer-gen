    "intro": "Taraxacum mucronatiforme, commonly known as the slender-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a single, hollow, hairy stem that supports a flower head. The plant produces a yellow flower that develops into a spherical, white, hairy pappus-bearing seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it identifiable and ecologically significant in its native range."
