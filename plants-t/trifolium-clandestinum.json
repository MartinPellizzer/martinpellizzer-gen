    "intro": "Trifolium clandestinum, commonly known as the secret clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or woodland environments. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
