    "intro": "Taxotrophis ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are a food source for various birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Taxotrophis ilicifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
