    "intro": "Thiollierea artensis, commonly known as the Artensis lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are broad and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
