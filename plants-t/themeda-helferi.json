It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but is most commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna. Themeda helferi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
