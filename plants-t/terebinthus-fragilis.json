It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Due to its fragrant oils, it has historical uses in perfumery and traditional medicine."
