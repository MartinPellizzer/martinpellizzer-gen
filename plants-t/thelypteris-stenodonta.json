    "intro": "Thelypteris stenodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris stenodonta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices."
