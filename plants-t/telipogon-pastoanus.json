    "intro": "Telipogon pastoanus, commonly known as the Pasto grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cooler, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
