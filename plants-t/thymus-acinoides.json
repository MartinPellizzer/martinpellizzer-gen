    "intro": "Thymus acinoides, commonly known as sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in herbal medicine for its antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Thymus acinoides is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
