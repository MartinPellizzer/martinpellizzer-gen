    "intro": "Tapinanthus villosiflorus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the Fabaceae family. Its stems are yellow to orange in color and covered with fine, hairy structures that aid in attachment. The flowers are small, clustered, and often have a distinctive hairy appearance, contributing to its common name. This species is found in various parts of Africa and is notable for its unique ecological role as a parasitic herb."
