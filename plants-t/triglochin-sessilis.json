    "intro": "Triglochin sessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved glasswort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of temperate regions. It typically grows in muddy or saline soils, often found in marshes, estuaries, and coastal areas. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, translucent wax. Its leaves are narrow and sessile, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Triglochin sessilis is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and salinity, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
