    "intro": "Tithymalus heldreichii subsp. semiverticillatus, commonly known as the Balkan tithymalus, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a herbaceous perennial with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
