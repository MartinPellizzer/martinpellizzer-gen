    "intro": "Tuamina michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's tuamina, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its slender stems and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. It is noted for its small, lance-shaped leaves and is considered a relict species with limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Tuamina michauxii is listed as endangered in several conservation assessments."
