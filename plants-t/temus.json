    "intro": "Temus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces strikingly beautiful flowers that range in color from white to pink and deep red. Its roots, known as tamarind, are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The botanical name *Nelumbo nucifera* reflects its significance in both cultural and ecological contexts."
