    "intro": "Tuberaria melastomifolia var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine tuberaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that are often glandular, aiding in water retention in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
