    "intro": "Tapinanthus bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees, particularly in disturbed or arid environments. Its unique parasitic lifestyle and delicate appearance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
