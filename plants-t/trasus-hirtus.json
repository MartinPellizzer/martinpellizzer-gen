    "intro": "Trasus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy tamarisk, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces small, pinkish flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and saline soils due to its salt tolerance. The hairy tamarisk plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
