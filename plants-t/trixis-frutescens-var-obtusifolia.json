    "intro": "Trixis frutescens var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved trixis, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in short inflorescences. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that aids in moisture retention. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
