It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other flowering plants with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species in botanical studies."
