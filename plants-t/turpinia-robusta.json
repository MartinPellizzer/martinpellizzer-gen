    "intro": "Turpinia robusta, commonly known as the broad-leafed turpinia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Turpinia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
