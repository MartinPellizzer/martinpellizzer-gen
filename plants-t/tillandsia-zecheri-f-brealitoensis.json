    "intro": "Tillandsia zecheri f. brealitoensis, commonly known as the Brealitoensis air plant, is a rare epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and sometimes endangered species in conservation efforts."
