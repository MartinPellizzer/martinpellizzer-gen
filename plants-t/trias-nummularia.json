    "intro": "Trias nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
