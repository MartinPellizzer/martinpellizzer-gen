    "intro": "Taraxacum papposum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, petal-like ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. This plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world."
