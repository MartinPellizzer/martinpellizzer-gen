    "intro": "Tsuga dumosa subsp. leptophylla, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a subspecies of the hemlock tree native to the western United States. It is a small, coniferous evergreen with slender, drooping branches and needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones are small and cylindrical, containing two to three seeds, and they mature in the second year. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its slow growth and distinctive appearance make it a valuable ornamental and ecological plant in suitable climates."
