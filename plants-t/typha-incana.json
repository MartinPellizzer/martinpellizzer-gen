    "intro": "Typha incana, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering spike that typically emerges from a dense, mat-like base of narrow leaves. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks that help stabilize soil and filter water. Typha incana plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various wildlife species."
