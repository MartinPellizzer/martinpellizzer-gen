    "intro": "Thalictrum gallicum proles parisiense, commonly known as the Paris marsh rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring partial to full shade. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable conditions. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
