    "intro": "Teucrium palmatum, commonly known as redstem germander, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use. Teucrium palmatum is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used in herbal remedies."
