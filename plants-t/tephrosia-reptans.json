    "intro": "Tephrosia reptans, commonly known as creeping tephrosia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Tephrosia reptans is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
