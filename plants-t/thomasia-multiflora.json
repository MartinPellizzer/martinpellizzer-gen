    "intro": "Thomasia multiflora, commonly known as the coastal thomasia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Thomasia multiflora is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
