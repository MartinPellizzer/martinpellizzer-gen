    "intro": "Thlaspi nivale, commonly known as snow groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing herb with a rosette of basal leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or barren soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Thlaspi nivale plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
