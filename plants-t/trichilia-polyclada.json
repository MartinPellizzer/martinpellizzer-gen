    "intro": "Trichilia polyclada, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
