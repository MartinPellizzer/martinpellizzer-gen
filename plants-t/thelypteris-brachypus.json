    "intro": "Thelypteris brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or cascading in appearance. The plant features sori that are clustered and covered by a thin, membranous indusium, a common trait in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Thelypteris brachypus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
