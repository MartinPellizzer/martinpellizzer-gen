It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. This plant is often found in open areas such as grasslands and slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
