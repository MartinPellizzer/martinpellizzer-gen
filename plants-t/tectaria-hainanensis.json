    "intro": "Tectaria hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan tectaria, is a fern native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or lobed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Tectaria hainanensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
