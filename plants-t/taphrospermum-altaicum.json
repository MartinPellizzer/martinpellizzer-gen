It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, adapted to the arid and high-altitude environment. Taphrospermum altaicum is valued for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
