    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum f. supatoshvilii, commonly known as the Georgian emmer wheat, is a botanical variant of emmer wheat characterized by its unique genetic makeup and morphological features. This subspecies is native to the Caucasus region and is distinguished by its semi-domesticated growth habit and specific leaf and spikelet structures. It exhibits a range of botanical traits, including a robust root system and a hardy, drought-resistant physiology. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a dense, cylindrical spike that bears small, spikelet-based grains. Its genetic diversity makes it an important subject for studies on ancient wheat domestication and crop resilience."
