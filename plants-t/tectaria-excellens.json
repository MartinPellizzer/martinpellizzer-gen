    "intro": "Tectaria excellens, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Tectaria excellens plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
