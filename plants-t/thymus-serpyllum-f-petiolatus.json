    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. petiolatus, commonly known as the petiolate thyme, is a variant of the common thyme with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give the leaves a more upright appearance compared to the typical thyme. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in compact clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, contributing to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
