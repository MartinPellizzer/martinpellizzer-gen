    "intro": "Trifolium pratense sativum, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a single stem. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in dense clusters, typically in the spring. Red clover is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable crop for improving soil fertility. It is also used in herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
