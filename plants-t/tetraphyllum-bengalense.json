    "intro": "Tetraphyllum bengalense, commonly known as the Bengal tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm rather than a typical plant, so it does not have botanical characteristics. It belongs to the class Cyclophyllida and is known for its complex life cycle involving intermediate hosts. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of its definitive host, typically a carnivorous mammal. It lacks the typical structures of plants such as roots, stems, and leaves. Instead, it has a segmented body with a head and a series of proglottids."
