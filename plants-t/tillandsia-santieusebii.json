    "intro": "Tillandsia santieusebii, commonly known as the Santa Eulalia air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
