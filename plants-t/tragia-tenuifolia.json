    "intro": "Tragia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tragia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often surrounded by bracts. Tragia tenuifolia is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and arid environments, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it is sometimes confused with other species in the genus Tragia."
