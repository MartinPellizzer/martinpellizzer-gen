    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens var. pseudoprocumbens, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves. The leaves are typically oval to heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The species is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
