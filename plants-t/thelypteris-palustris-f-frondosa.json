    "intro": "Thelypteris palustris f. frondosa, commonly known as the swamp fern or marsh fern, is a fern species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form. The fronds are usually dark green and have a soft, leathery texture, with a distinctive rhizome system that helps it thrive in moist, acidic soils. This fern prefers partial to full shade and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
