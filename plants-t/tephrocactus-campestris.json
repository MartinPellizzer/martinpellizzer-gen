    "intro": "Tephrocactus campestris, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and provide protection from herbivores. Tephrocactus campestris is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
