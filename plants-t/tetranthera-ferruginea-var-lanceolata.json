    "intro": "Tetranthera ferruginea var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf iron vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
