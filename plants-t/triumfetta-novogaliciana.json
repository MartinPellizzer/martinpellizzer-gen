    "intro": "Triumfetta novogaliciana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and landscaping in regions with similar climates."
