    "intro": "Tillandsia genseri, commonly known as the Genesi's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
