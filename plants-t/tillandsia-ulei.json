    "intro": "Tillandsia ulei, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia ulei is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
