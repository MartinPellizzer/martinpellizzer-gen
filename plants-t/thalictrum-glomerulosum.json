    "intro": "Thalictrum glomerulosum, commonly known as the clustered meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, slender stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Thalictrum glomerulosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
