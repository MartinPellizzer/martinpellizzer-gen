    "intro": "Tillandsia dependens f. perusneoides, commonly known as the Peruvian air plant, is a unique bromeliad species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, thin leaves that form a rosette, creating a small, water-holding structure at the center. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime. This plant requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
