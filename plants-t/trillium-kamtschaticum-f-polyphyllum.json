    "intro": "Trillium kamtschaticum f. polyphyllum, commonly known as the Kamchatka trillium, is a rare and striking perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its three broad, waxy leaves and a single, showy white or pinkish flower that emerges from a short stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near the coast where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its foliage and floral structure are typical of the Trillium genus, with a distinctive whorl of leaves and a three-lobed spathe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
