    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. uncinatum, commonly known as hulless barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and spikelets that lack the awns found in many other barley varieties. The plant produces small, pale blue to greenish flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in a hull that does not separate easily from the grain. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This species is valued for its use in traditional and modern food products, including bread and porridge."
