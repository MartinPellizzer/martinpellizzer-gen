    "intro": "Trillium divaricatum, commonly known as the yellow trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features three elliptical, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and have a distinctive reddish or purple midrib. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Trillium divaricatum is often found in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is considered a valuable component of forest ecosystems."
