    "intro": "Trisetum sandbergii, commonly known as Sandberg's wood oat, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
