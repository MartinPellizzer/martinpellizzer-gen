    "intro": "Taxus adpressa, commonly known as the dwarf yew, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, scale-like foliage that forms a rounded shape, with small, dark green leaves arranged in tight clusters. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for birds. Taxus adpressa is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky soils. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscape design."
