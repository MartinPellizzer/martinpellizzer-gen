    "intro": "Tillaea erecta subsp. eremica, commonly known as the desert tillia, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
