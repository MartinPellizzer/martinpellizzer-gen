    "intro": "Tillandsia soratensis, commonly known as the Sorate air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, instead absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture and store water. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple bracts and small, delicate flowers. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a sought-after species among bromeliad enthusiasts."
