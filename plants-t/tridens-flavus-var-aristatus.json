    "intro": "Tridens flavus var. aristatus, commonly known as the golden grass or yellow panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a yellowish-green color and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. It has fibrous roots and is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. The varietal form 'aristatus' is distinguished by its elongated, bristle-like awns on the seed heads."
