    "intro": "Telipogon gymnostele, commonly known as the naked-stemmed orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique morphology, with its leaves arranged in a rosette pattern and a lack of true roots, relying instead on symbiotic fungi for nutrient absorption. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats where conditions are harsh and competition is minimal. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Telipogon gymnostele is considered a vulnerable species."
