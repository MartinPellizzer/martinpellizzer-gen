It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, and the tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Terminalia madagascariensis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
