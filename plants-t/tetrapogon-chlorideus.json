    "intro": "Tetrapogon chlorideus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish and are adapted for wind pollination. Tetrapogon chlorideus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
