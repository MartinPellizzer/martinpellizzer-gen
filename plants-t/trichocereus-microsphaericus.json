    "intro": "Trichocereus microsphaericus, commonly known as the \"Papalote\" or \"Moon cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a distinctive rib structure and produces small, spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also noted for its potential psychoactive properties."
