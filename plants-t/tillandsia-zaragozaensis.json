    "intro": "Tillandsia zaragozaensis, commonly known as the Zaragoza airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to survive in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
