    "intro": "Tillandsia rubrispica, commonly known as the red-spined air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically red or orange, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, warm environments."
