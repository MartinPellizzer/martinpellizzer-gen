    "intro": "Trifolium miegeanum, commonly known as the Miegean clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Trifolium miegeanum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve soil fertility."
