    "intro": "Tieghemopanax neoebudarum, commonly known as the Neobudarum arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant has a climbing habit, often using aerial roots to ascend trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
