    "intro": "Tovomita macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem and can grow up to several meters tall, making it a striking addition to gardens. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to dry conditions. Tovomita macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
