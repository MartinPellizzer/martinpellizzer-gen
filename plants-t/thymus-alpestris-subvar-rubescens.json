    "intro": "Thymus alpestris subvar. rubescens, commonly known as Alpine thyme or red thyme, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features compact, low-growing stems with small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, contain thymol and other volatile compounds, making it valuable in herbal medicine and aromatherapy. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and high-altitude environments."
