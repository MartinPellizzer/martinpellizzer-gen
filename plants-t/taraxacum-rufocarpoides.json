    "intro": "Taraxacum rufocarpoides, commonly known as the red-fruited dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, reddish-brown achene with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. Taraxacum rufocarpoides is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
