    "intro": "Tritoniopsis lata var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract tritoniopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
