    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides subvar. courcellei, commonly known as sweet thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, slender leaves that are often used in culinary applications due to their pleasant scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical characteristics include hairy stems and a creeping growth habit, which help it to form dense mats in its natural habitat."
