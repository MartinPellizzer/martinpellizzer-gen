    "intro": "Taraxacum ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, and thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single flower head. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by a fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
