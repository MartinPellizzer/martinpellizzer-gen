    "intro": "Trifolium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France, it thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
