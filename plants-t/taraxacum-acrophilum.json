    "intro": "Taraxacum acrophilum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a tall, slender stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds, a common trait among the genus Taraxacum. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open meadows and grasslands."
