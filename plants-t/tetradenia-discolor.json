    "intro": "Tetradenia discolor, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark red or black fruits containing one or two seeds. Tetradenia discolor is valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and carving, though its conservation status is of concern due to overharvesting."
