    "intro": "Tiniaria sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin tiniaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
