    "intro": "Tontelea grandiflora, commonly known as the giant tontelea, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a woody stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
