    "intro": "Taxus monstrosa, commonly known as the twisted yew, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and dark green, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Taxus monstrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique form and resilience. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
