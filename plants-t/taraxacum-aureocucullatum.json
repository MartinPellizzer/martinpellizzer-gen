    "intro": "Taraxacum aureocucullatum, commonly known as the golden-hat dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports its flowering head, which is surrounded by a crown of bracts. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, thriving in temperate climates."
