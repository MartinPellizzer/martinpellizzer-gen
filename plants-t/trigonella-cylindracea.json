It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical seed pods.

Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and are similar in some properties to those of the common fenugreek. The botanical features of Trigonella cylindracea make it an important species for ecological and agricultural studies in its native habitat."
