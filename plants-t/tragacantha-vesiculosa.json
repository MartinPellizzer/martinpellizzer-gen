    "intro": "Tragacantha vesiculosa, commonly known as the bladderleaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. The plant is known for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent."
