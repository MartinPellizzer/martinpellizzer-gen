    "intro": "Thymus fruticulosus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its aromatic properties and hardy nature contribute to its widespread use in horticulture and traditional medicine."
