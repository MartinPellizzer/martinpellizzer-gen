    "intro": "Trachydium loloense, commonly known as the Lolo sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Trachydium loloense is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in high-altitude environments."
