    "intro": "Thymus ucrainicus, commonly known as Ukrainian thyme, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its strong, pungent aroma. The species is closely related to other thyme species but is distinguished by its unique floral structure and geographic distribution."
