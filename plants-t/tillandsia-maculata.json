    "intro": "Tillandsia maculata, commonly known as the spotted air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Native to Central and South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its striking appearance, with white and green striped leaves, makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
