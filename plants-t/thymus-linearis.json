    "intro": "Thymus linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental value make it both a useful ground cover and a valuable plant for herbal use."
