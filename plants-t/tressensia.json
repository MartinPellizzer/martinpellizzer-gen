Its leaves are composed of overlapping, lance-shaped segments that create a feathery appearance, often resembling the fronds of a fern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Tressensia is known for its ability to purify air and is often used in indoor gardening for its aesthetic and air-purifying properties. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and is typically propagated through division or spores."
