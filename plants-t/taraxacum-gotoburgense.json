    "intro": "Taraxacum gotoburgense, commonly known as the Gotborg dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that releases seeds with feathery parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
