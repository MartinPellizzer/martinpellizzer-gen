    "intro": "Trillium cernuum f. walpolei, commonly known as the nodding white trillium, is a rare and striking herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three white petals, three sepals, and three leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a short, rhizomatous root system. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is known for its delicate, nodding appearance. The f. walpolei form is distinguished by its more elongated petals and is considered a botanical curiosity due to its limited distribution."
