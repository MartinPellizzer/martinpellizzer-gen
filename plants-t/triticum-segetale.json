    "intro": "Triticum segetale, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in fields. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a fibrous root system, which help it thrive in varied environments. Triticum segetale is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in ecological and agricultural contexts."
