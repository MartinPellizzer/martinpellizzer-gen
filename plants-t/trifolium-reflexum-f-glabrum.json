    "intro": "Trifolium reflexum f. glabrum, commonly known as the glabrous bentgrass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage, which sets it apart from other forms of Trifolium reflexum."
