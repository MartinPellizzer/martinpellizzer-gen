    "intro": "Taraxacum collarispinulosum, commonly known as the spiny-haired dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered with fine, spiny hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, white, puffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. This species is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
