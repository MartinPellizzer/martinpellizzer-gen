    "intro": "Tacsonia hederacea, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The leaves and flowers are edible, though some sources caution against consuming large quantities due to potential mild toxicity."
