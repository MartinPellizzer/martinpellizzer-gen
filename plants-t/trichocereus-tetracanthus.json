    "intro": "Trichocereus tetracanthus, commonly known as the \"Peruvian torch cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, covered with spiny areoles. The plant produces large, white, funnel-shaped flowers during the night, which are pollinated by moths. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and cultural significance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
