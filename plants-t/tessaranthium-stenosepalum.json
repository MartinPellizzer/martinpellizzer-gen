    "intro": "Tessaranthium stenosepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal tessara, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with narrow sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct veining pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
