It features showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Tolumnia urophylla thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
