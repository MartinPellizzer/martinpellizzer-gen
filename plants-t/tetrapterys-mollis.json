    "intro": "Tetrapterys mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings. Tetrapterys mollis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it both a useful forage plant and a potential weed."
