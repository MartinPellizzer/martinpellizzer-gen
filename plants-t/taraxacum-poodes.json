    "intro": "Taraxacum poodes, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into fluffy white seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
