    "intro": "Thelesperma subnudum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine lesperma, is a low-growing shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its arid, mountainous habitat. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against harsh environmental conditions. This variety is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes."
