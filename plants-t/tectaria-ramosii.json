    "intro": "Tectaria ramosii, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are usually leathery and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
