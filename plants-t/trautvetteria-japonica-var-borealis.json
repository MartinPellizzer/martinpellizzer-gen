    "intro": "Trautvetteria japonica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern trautvetteria, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variant is distinguished from other Trautvetteria species by its more northern distribution and specific morphological traits."
