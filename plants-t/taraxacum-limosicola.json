    "intro": "Taraxacum limosicola, commonly known as the marsh dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This species is typically found in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. Its flowers produce small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often an indicator of wetland ecosystems."
