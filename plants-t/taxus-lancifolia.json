    "intro": "Taxus lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along its branches. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some resistance to environmental stressors. Taxus lancifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
