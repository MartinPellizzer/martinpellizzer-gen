    "intro": "Trimorpha rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian trillium, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its three-part leaves and three-petaled flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has a long history of being studied for its unique botanical features and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Trimorpha rhaetica is now considered a vulnerable species."
