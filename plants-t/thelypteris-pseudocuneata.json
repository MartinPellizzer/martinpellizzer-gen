    "intro": "Thelypteris pseudocuneata, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris pseudocuneata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
