    "intro": "Trianaea neovisae, commonly known as the Visayan trianaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Visayas region of the Philippines. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trianaea neovisae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
