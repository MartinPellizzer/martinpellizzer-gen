    "intro": "Thalictrum leucostylum, commonly known as the white meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a fibrous root system, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white, lace-like flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of narrow, serrated leaflets, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum leucostylum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or meadow habitats."
