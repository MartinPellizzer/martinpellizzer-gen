    "intro": "Tillandsia plumosa, commonly known as the feathered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its most distinctive feature is its long, feathery leaves that give it a unique, elegant appearance. The plant is capable of absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of trichomes. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
