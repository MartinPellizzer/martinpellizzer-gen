    "intro": "Trichomanes labiatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and distinctive, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and the plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique morphology that reflects its adaptation to humid, forest floor conditions."
