    "intro": "Trambis tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous trambis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil. Trambis tuberosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with full sun exposure."
