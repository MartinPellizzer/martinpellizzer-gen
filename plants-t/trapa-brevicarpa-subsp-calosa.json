    "intro": "Trapa brevicarpa subsp. calosa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and the flowers are small and yellowish-green. The subspecies calosa is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fruiting structures compared to other Trapa species."
