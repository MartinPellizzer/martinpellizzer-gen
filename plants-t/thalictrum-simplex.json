    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and showy inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Thalictrum simplex is often found in woodland and meadow habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
