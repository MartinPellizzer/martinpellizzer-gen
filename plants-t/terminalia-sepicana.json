    "intro": "Terminalia sepicana, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and clusters of white flowers that appear in spring, giving it a snowball-like appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy green surface. The tree produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by local communities. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
