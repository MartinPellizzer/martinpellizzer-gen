    "intro": "Taraxacum pycnocarpum, commonly known as the dense-fruited dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. Its fruit is a pappus-equipped achene, which is dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread easily. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural and urban areas."
