    "intro": "Taraxacum schizophyllum, commonly known as the split-stem dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces a hollow, elongated stem that supports a single flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its fruit is a distinctive, wind-dispersed achene with a pappus, allowing for efficient seed distribution. This species is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across temperate regions."
