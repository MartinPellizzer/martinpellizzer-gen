    "intro": "Thalictrum thunbergii var. contractum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow rue, is a perennial plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
