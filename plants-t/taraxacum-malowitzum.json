    "intro": "Taraxacum malowitzum, commonly known as the Malowitz dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm. The plant's structure and reproductive strategy are typical of the genus Taraxacum, which includes many dandelion species."
