It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological restoration settings."
