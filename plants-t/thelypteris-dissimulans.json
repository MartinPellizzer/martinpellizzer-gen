    "intro": "Thelypteris dissimulans, commonly known as the hidden fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris dissimulans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
