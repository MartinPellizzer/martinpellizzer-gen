It is characterized by its dark, almost black berries that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators. The berries are edible, though some varieties may have a tart or bitter taste."
