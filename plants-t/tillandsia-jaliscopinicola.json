    "intro": "Tillandsia jaliscopinicola, commonly known as the Jalisco pine tillandsia, is a rare air plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that trap moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree branches or rocky surfaces. Its small, clustered inflorescence produces pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom briefly during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
