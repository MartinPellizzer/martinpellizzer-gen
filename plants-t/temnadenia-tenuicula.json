    "intro": "Temnadenia tenuicula, commonly known as the slender temnadenia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
