    "intro": "Thelypteris boromir, commonly known as Boromir's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable."
