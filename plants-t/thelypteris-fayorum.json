    "intro": "Thelypteris fayorum, commonly known as the Cayman fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris fayorum plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
