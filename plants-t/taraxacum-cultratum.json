    "intro": "Taraxacum cultratum, commonly known as the cutleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble a sickle or a blade, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum cultratum is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and garden beds."
