    "intro": "Thelypteris squamigera, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of silky, silver hairs, which contribute to its common name. Thelypteris squamigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, woodland conditions."
