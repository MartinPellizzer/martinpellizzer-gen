    "intro": "Theodorea yakla, commonly known as the Yakla orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that typically come in shades of white and pink. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Theodorea yakla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
