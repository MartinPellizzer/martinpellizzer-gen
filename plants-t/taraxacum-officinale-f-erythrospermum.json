    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale f. erythrospermum, commonly known as the red-seeded dandelion, is a botanical variant of the common dandelion. It is characterized by its bright red or orange seeds, which distinguish it from the typical yellow seeds of the main species. This form is often found in disturbed soils and open areas, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces a hollow, hairy stem topped with a composite flower head. It is valued in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
