    "intro": "Thelypteris loretensis, commonly known as the Loretto holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread slowly in suitable environments. Thelypteris loretensis is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil."
