    "intro": "Tetrastigma cauliflorum, commonly known as the climbing grapevine, is a woody vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that aid in its ascent along supports. The plant exhibits cauliflorous growth, meaning its flowers and fruits develop directly from the stems rather than the branches. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are small and clustered. The fruit is a small, round berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color, often used in traditional medicine and local cuisine."
