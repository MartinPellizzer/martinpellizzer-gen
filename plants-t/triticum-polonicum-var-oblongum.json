    "intro": "Triticum polonicum var. oblongum, commonly known as the Polish ryegrass, is a variant of a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated, lance-shaped leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and small, two-lobed flowers that produce three-branched spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
