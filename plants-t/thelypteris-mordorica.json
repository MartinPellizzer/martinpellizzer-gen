    "intro": "Thelypteris mordorica, commonly known as the \"Mordor Fern,\" is a species of evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris mordorica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
