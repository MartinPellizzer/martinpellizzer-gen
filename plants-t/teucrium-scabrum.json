It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its small, tubular flowers are usually blue or violet, arranged in spikes, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Teucrium scabrum is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
