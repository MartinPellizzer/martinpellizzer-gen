    "intro": "Troximon alpestre, commonly known as the alpine thistle, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
