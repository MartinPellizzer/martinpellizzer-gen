    "intro": "Thalictrum clematidifolium, commonly known as the fern-leaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spire-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens with partial shade."
