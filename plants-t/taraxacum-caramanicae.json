    "intro": "Taraxacum caramanicae, commonly known as the Caramanica dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces a spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind, a common trait among dandelions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum caramanicae is noted for its medicinal properties, with parts of the plant traditionally used in herbal remedies."
