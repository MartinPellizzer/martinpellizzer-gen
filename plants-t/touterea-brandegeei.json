It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and conservation areas."
