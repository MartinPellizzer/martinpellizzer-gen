    "intro": "Trochocarpa disticha var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved starleaf, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
