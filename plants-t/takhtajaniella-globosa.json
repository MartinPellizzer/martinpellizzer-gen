    "intro": "Takhtajaniella globosa, commonly known as the globular thistle, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny head of flowers, which is often covered in dense, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, providing some protection against harsh environmental conditions. Takhtajaniella globosa is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows."
