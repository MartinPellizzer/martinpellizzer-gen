    "intro": "Tillandsia quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to tree trunks or branches. The plant produces striking, spiral-shaped inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes that help absorb moisture from the air. This unique adaptation allows it to thrive in humid, shaded environments where it can efficiently capture water and nutrients."
