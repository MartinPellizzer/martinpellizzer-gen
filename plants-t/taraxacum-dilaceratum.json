    "intro": "Taraxacum dilaceratum, commonly known as the broken-leaved dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often notched or lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Taraxacum dilaceratum is generally herbaceous, with a short, fibrous root system and is adapted to temperate climates."
