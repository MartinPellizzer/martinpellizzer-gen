    "intro": "Trisetum agrostideum subsp. baregense, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh climates, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
