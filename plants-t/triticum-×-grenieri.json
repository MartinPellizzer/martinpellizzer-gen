    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 grenieri, commonly known as the hybrid wheat, is a synthetic hexaploid wheat species resulting from the cross between Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii. It possesses a genome composition of AABBDD, combining the genomes of its parent species. This plant is characterized by its tall stature, large grain heads, and high seed yield potential. It is primarily used in breeding programs to introduce desirable traits into modern wheat varieties. Its botanical features make it an important resource for genetic improvement in wheat cultivation."
