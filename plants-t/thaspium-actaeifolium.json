    "intro": "Thaspium actaeifolium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in rocky, limestone-rich soils. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
