    "intro": "Thymus pubescens var. cratericola, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features wiry stems covered in dense, grayish-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, typical of the Lamiaceae family. Its leaves are aromatic, containing essential oils that contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
