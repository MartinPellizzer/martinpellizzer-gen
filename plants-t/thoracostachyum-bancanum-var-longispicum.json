    "intro": "Thoracostachyum bancanum var. longispicum, commonly known as the longispiculate thornapple, is a unique species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces striking, spiny, yellowish-green bracts that resemble flowers. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is notable for its distinctive spines and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in specialized gardens."
