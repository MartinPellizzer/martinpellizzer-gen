    "intro": "Trixis mexicana var. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican trixis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Trixis mexicana var. mexicana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments."
