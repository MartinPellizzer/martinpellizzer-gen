    "intro": "Taraxacum citrinum, commonly known as the lemon hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be toxic to some animals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Lemon hawkweed is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
