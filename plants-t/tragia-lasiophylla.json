It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Tragia lasiophylla is an annual herb that thrives in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it adaptable to harsh conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution in tropical and subtropical regions."
