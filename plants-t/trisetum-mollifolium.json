    "intro": "Trisetum mollifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Trisetum mollifolium is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
