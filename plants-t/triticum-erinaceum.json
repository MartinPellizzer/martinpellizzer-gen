It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has small, pale blue or greenish flowers and produces tough, bristle-like seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
