    "intro": "Theilera, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Theilera species are characterized by their large, showy, nocturnal flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruits are usually berries that contain several seeds, and the plants are often grown for their ornamental value due to their unique blooming habits."
