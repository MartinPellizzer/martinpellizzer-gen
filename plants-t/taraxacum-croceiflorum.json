    "intro": "Taraxacum croceiflorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in a single, showy head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. The flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and hoverflies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect biodiversity."
