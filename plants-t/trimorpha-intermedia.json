    "intro": "Trimorpha intermedia, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to white. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Trimorpha intermedia plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
