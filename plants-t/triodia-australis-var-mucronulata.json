    "intro": "Triodia australis var. mucronulata, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of semi-arid ecosystems."
