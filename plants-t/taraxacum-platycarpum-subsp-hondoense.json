    "intro": "Taraxacum platycarpum subsp. hondoense, commonly known as the Hondo dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, slender stem that terminates in a single, spherical flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. Its flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by the formation of a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings."
