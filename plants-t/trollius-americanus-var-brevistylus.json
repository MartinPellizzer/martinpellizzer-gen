    "intro": "Trollius americanus var. brevistylus, commonly known as the short-styled American globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands or meadows. Its leaves are compound, with slender, grass-like leaflets. The variety is distinguished by its shorter styles compared to other Trollius species, a characteristic that aids in its pollination strategy."
