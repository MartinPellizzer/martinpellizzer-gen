    "intro": "Trema orientale var. viride, commonly known as the green trema, is a variant of the tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests or as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for vertical gardening and landscape design."
