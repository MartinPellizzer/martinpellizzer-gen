    "intro": "Tapinanthus prunifolius, commonly known as the apple-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle where it attaches to host plants using haustoria. The plant is native to regions of Africa and is often found on hosts such as Euphorbiaceae and Malvaceae. Its leaves are small and resemble apple leaves, giving it its common name. It plays a role in ecological interactions by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
