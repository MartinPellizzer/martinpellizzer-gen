    "intro": "Tillandsia rectiflora, commonly known as the straight-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern along the stem. Tillandsia rectiflora is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
