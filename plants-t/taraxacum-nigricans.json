    "intro": "Taraxacum nigricans, commonly known as the blackweed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a single, bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical, spiky seed ball known as a pappus. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Taraxacum nigricans is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
