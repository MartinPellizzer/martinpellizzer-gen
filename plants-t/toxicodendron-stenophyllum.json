    "intro": "Toxicodendron stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a cluster of three leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. It contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
