    "intro": "Telipogon monticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky slopes or in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Telipogon monticola is considered a vulnerable species."
