    "intro": "Trillium lirioides f. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated wake-robin, is a rare and striking variant of the wake-robin species. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated leaf patterns, featuring white and green mottling, which sets it apart from the typical solid green leaves of the species. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in the eastern United States. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
