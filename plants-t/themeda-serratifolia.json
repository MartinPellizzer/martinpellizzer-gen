    "intro": "Themeda serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated grass or narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves and forms dense tussocks, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Themeda serratifolia is an important component of many native ecosystems and is valued for its ecological and ornamental attributes."
