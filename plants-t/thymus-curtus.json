    "intro": "Thymus curtus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a dense mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Thymus curtus is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
