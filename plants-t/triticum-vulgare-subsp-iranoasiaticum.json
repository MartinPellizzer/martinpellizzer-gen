    "intro": "Triticum vulgare subsp. iranoasiaticum, commonly known as the Iranian wild wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and compact spikelets. This subspecies is native to regions spanning from the Middle East to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils. Its genetic diversity is valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses."
