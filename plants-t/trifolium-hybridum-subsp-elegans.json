    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum subsp. elegans, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
