    "intro": "Tretorhiza tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan tretorhiza, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tianshan Mountains in Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
