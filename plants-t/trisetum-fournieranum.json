    "intro": "Trisetum fournieranum, commonly known as the Fournier's wood sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny brown flowers. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants. Trisetum fournieranum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
