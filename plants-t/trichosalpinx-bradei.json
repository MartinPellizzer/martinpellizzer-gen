It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and violet flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its roots are often specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and moths, contributing to its ecological role in the ecosystem."
