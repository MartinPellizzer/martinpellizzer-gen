    "intro": "Trembleya phlogiformis, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help store water, adapting it to its humid, shaded environment. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Trembleya phlogiformis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
