    "intro": "Tetranthera laeta var. major, commonly known as the golden spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems that often trail along the ground, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are borne on short, erect pedicels and are surrounded by bracts that give the inflorescence a distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
