    "intro": "Tricalysia potamogala, commonly known as the river almond tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree with simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The flowers are small and clustered in panicles, typically white or pale yellow in color. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. It is often found growing near water sources, which reflects its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
