    "intro": "Tillandsia kegeliana, commonly known as the Kegel's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with long, slender flowers that are typically pink or red. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
