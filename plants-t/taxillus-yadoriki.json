    "intro": "Taxillus yadoriki, commonly known as the Japanese mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus Quercus. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, absorbing them through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or green berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its growth is slow, and it can remain on a host tree for decades, forming dense clusters. Taxillus yadoriki plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing habitat for various organisms."
