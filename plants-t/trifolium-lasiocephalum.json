    "intro": "Trifolium lasiocephalum, commonly known as hairy crowned clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy on the upper surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. Trifolium lasiocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
