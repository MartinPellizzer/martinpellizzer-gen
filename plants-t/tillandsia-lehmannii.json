    "intro": "Tillandsia lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
