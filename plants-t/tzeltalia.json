    "intro": "Tzeltalia, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical classification places it within the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional healing practices. Due to habitat loss, the tzeltalia is now considered a threatened species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
