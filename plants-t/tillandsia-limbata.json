    "intro": "Tillandsia limbata, commonly known as the silver vane air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth. Its inflorescence produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Tillandsia limbata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
