    "intro": "Traganum, commonly known as the pigweed or redroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Chenopodiaceae. These plants are typically annual or perennial herbs with succulent stems and leaves that often have a reddish tint. Traganum species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are adapted to thrive in dry conditions with deep root systems that allow them to access water from deeper soil layers. Some species are considered invasive and can compete with native vegetation in disturbed environments."
