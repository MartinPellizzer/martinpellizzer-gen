    "intro": "Turpinia parvifoliola, commonly known as the small-leaved turpinia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant landscapes."
