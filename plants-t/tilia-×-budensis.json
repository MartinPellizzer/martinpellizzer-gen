It is a natural hybrid between Tilia cordata (small-leaf linden) and Tilia europaea (large-leaf linden). The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in drooping clusters, producing a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators.
