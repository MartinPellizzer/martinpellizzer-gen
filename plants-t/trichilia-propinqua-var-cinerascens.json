    "intro": "Trichilia propinqua var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leafed trichilia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive ash-gray bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, legume-like pods containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties. The varietal name 'cinerascens' refers to its ash-colored appearance, particularly on the bark and young leaves."
