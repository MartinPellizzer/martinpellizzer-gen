It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands or stream banks. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators like bees. Due to habitat loss, Tithymalus stygianus is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
