    "intro": "Tragacantha ammodendron, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-barked trunk and dense, thorny branches that provide habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, sticky resinous pods that contain a gum known as tragacanth, used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Tragacantha ammodendron plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity."
