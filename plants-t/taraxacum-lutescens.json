    "intro": "Taraxacum lutescens, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, yellowish-green leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, golden-yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
