    "intro": "Thelypteris japonica var. formosa, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to East Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
