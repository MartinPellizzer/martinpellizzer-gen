    "intro": "Thecacoris micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a compact, mat-like growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Thecacoris micrantha is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
