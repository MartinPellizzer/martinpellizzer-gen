It is characterized by its slender stems and small, often clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and prefers moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
