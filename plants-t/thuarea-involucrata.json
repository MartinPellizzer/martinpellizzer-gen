    "intro": "Thuarea involucrata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Thuarea involucrata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
