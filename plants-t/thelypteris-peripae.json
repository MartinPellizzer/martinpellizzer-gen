    "intro": "Thelypteris peripae, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often deeply divided, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Thelypteris peripae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms."
