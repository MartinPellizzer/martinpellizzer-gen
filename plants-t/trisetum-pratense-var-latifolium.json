It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming habit and is often found in temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
