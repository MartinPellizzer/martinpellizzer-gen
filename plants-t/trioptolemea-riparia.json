    "intro": "Trioptolemea riparia, commonly known as the riverbank mallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found growing along riverbanks and moist soils. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers with five petals, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various insects and its ecological importance in stabilizing riverbanks."
