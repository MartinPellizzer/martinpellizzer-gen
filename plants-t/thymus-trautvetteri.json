    "intro": "Thymus trautvetteri, commonly known as Trautvetter's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal gardens."
