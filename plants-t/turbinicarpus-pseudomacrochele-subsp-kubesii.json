    "intro": "Turbinicarpus pseudomacrochele subsp. kubesii, commonly known as the Kubes' Turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring or early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem. This subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and is relatively easy to care for in a suitable environment."
