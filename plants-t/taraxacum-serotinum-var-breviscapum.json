    "intro": "Taraxacum serotinum var. breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, toothed leaves and a hairy, short stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature and unique floral morphology compared to other dandelion species."
