    "intro": "Thelypteris brunnea var. hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Thelypteris. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and often produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of its fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
