    "intro": "Trichophorum lineatum, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of fine, hair-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems. Trichophorum lineatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
