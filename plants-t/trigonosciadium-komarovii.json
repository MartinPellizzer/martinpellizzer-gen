    "intro": "Trigonosciadium komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's trigonosciadium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to Central Asia and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
