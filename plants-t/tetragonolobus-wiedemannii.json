    "intro": "Tetragonolobus wiedemannii, commonly known as the Wiedemann's four-angled bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for its seed protein content."
