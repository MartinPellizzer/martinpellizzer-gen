    "intro": "Tectaria periya, commonly known as the Malabar shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a protective, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Tectaria periya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
