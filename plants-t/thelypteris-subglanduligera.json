    "intro": "Thelypteris subglanduligera, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a species of polypodiaceae fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy, dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The leaves are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments, and the plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's botanical features make it a distinctive and often sought-after specimen in horticulture and botanical gardens."
