    "intro": "Tillandsia erubescens var. arroyoensis, commonly known as the Red Tillandsia, is a bromeliad native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This variety is characterized by its vibrant red and orange bracts that surround the small, white flowers. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found on cacti or trees in rocky habitats. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water due to its drought-tolerant nature. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for succulent and bromeliad collections."
