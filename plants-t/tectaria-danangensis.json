    "intro": "Tectaria danangensis, commonly known as the Danang shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a rugged, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
