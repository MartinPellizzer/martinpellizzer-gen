    "intro": "Tragacantha rhodochroa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive grayish bark and long, slender leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by pods containing a sticky, resinous sap. This sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural thickening agent. The tree is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species in regions with limited water resources."
