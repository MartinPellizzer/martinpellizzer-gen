    "intro": "Typhonium cuspidatum, commonly known as the spike-tailed arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental and sometimes toxic plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially irritating to the skin and mucous membranes."
