    "intro": "Trichoglottis winkleri var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf trichoglottis, is a rare and compact orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in lowland rainforests. It has a pseudobulbous structure, with each pseudobulb supporting a single leaf and a flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
