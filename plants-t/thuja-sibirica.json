    "intro": "Thuja sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian thuja, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and its ability to thrive in harsh climates with poor soil conditions. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in flat, crossed pairs. Its cones are small and reddish-brown, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Thuja sibirica is widely used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
