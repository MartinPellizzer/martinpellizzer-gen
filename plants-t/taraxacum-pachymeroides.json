    "intro": "Taraxacum pachymeroides, commonly known as the thick-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower that develops into a spherical seed head with white, feathery seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
