It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Taeniophyllum oblongum is notable for its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, tropical climates."
