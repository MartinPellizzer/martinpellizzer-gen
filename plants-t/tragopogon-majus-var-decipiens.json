    "intro": "Tragopogon majus var. decipiens, commonly known as the \"honey flower\" or \"goat's beard,\" is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and bright yellow composite flower heads that resemble a crown. The plant produces a long, slender seed stem with a tuft of white bristles at the tip, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and easily identifiable species within the Asteraceae family."
