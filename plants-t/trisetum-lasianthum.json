    "intro": "Trisetum lasianthum, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale blue to purple florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trisetum lasianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
