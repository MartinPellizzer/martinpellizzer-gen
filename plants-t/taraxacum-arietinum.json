    "intro": "Taraxacum arietinum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small florets that mature into fluffy white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
