It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are typically herbaceous, with hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. They have alternate, narrow leaves and produce seeds in small, spiny capsules. Tetraneuris species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments."
