    "intro": "Trymatococcus dorstenioides, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces a single, slender stem that bears a crown of stiff, needle-like leaves. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's reproductive structures include a large, spiky male cone and a smaller, female cone, which are essential for its unique pollination process. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
