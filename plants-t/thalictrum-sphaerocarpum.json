    "intro": "Thalictrum sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe-fruited meadow-rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its unique spherical, berry-like fruits are a distinguishing feature, often containing multiple seeds. Thalictrum sphaerocarpum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
