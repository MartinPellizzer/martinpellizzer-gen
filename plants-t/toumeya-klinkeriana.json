    "intro": "Toumeya klinkeriana, commonly known as the Klinkerian toumeya, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes well-known genera such as Cashew and Mango. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a drupe, typically containing a single seed enclosed in a hard, woody pulp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Toumeya klinkeriana is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
