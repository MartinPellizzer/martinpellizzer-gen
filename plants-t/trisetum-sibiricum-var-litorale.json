    "intro": "Trisetum sibiricum var. litorale, commonly known as coastal bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Asia and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration projects."
