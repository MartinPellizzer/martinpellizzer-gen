    "intro": "Tillandsia cyanea, commonly known as the violet air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia cyanea produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
