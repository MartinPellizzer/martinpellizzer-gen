    "intro": "Triumfetta heterocarpa var. glabrior, commonly known as the smooth triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, pale yellow flowers and hairy stems, though the varietal name \"glabrior\" refers to its relatively smoother texture compared to other varieties. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open woodlands or along roadsides. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy surface, contributing to its adaptability in various environments."
