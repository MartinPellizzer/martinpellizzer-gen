    "intro": "Tamarix salina, commonly known as salt cedar, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline and coastal environments. Its roots can absorb and store salt, which helps it thrive in areas where other plants struggle. Tamarix salina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soils in challenging conditions."
