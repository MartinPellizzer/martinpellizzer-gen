    "intro": "Tapinanthus polycryptus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle involving both seed and vegetative propagation. Its roots form haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and survival of its host plants."
