    "intro": "Trifolium bituminosum, commonly known as bituminous clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.

Bituminous clover is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
