    "intro": "Taraxacum abruptilobum, commonly known as the abrupt-lobed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces a long, hollow stem with a milky sap that is characteristic of the genus Taraxacum. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, allowing the plant to spread efficiently in various environments."
