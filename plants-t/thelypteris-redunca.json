    "intro": "Thelypteris redunca, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, slender stalks. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. Thelypteris redunca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its lush, green appearance."
