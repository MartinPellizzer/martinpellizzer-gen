    "intro": "Teucridium parvifolium f. luxurians, commonly known as the luxuriant teucridium, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically a glossy green, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round, orange-red berries. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and seasonal flowering display."
