    "intro": "Trichomanes bryoides, commonly known as the moss fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble moss, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices. It has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Trichomanes bryoides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high moisture and low light conditions."
