    "intro": "Tillandsia schiedeana var. totolapanensis, commonly known as the Totolapan air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
