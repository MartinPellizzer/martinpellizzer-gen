    "intro": "Taraxacum nigrocephalum, commonly known as black-headed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a single, hollow, hairless stem that supports a large, showy yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which mature into a spherical, white to pale yellow pappus that aids in wind dispersal. This species is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a perennial plant that thrives in temperate climates and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
