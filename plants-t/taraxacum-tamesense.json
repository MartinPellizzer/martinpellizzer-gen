    "intro": "Taraxacum tamesense, commonly known as the Tamese dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a bright yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with a white, feathery pappus that allows seeds to be carried by the wind. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
