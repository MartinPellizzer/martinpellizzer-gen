    "intro": "Trochocephalus epirotus, commonly known as the Epirotic snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Helicidae and is characterized by its spiral shell, which is typically smooth and glossy. The snail's body is soft and covered with a slimy mucus layer, which helps in reducing water loss. It is primarily found in moist, forested areas where it feeds on decaying plant matter. This species plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
