    "intro": "Trichodium setifolium, commonly known as the hairy trichodium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Trichodium setifolium is often found in dune habitats and is adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy conditions."
