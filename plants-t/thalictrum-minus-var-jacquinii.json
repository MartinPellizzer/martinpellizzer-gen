    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacob's ladder, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in partial to full shade with moist, well-drained soil. Its unique, ladder-like arrangement of flowers gives it its common name, and it is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Botanically, it belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit."
