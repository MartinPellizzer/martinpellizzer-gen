    "intro": "Taraxacum waltheri, commonly known as the Walther's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head. This perennial plant is native to Central Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The flower head produces a distinctive seed head with pappus bracts that aid in wind dispersal. Taraxacum waltheri is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
