    "intro": "Trichomanes canariense, commonly known as Canary fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, spore-producing clusters called sori. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species."
