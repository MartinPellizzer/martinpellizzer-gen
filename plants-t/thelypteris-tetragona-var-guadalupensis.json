    "intro": "Thelypteris tetragona var. guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupine shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Thelypteris. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
