    "intro": "Thelypteris trichochlamys, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
