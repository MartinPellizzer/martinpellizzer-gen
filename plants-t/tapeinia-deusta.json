    "intro": "Tapeinia deusta, commonly known as the mistletoe of the oak, is a hemiparasitic plant that primarily grows on Quercus species. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant forms a dense, evergreen shrub with small, leathery leaves and white, fleshy berries. It is often found in temperate regions where its host trees are abundant. Tapeinia deusta plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by supporting various insect and bird species."
