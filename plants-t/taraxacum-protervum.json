    "intro": "Taraxacum protervum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, hairy flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which mature into a composite seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for centuries."
