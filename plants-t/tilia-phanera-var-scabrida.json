    "intro": "Tilia phanera var. scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved lime, is a variant of the lime tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are usually grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by spherical, greenish-brown fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree has a broad, rounded canopy."
