    "intro": "Tragacantha scopulorum, commonly known as the rock tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. Its roots are capable of storing water, allowing it to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Tragacantha scopulorum is often found growing on limestone or sandy substrates in dry, sunny habitats."
