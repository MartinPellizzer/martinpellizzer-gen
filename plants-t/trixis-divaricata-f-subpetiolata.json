    "intro": "Trixis divaricata f. subpetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf trixis, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh desert environments."
