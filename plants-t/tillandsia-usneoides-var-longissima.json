    "intro": "Tillandsia usneoides var. longissima, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging filaments that form dense, lace-like cascades. It is often found growing on trees in the southeastern United States and parts of South America. While it appears parasitic, it does not harm its host and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
