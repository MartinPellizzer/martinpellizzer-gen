    "intro": "Thelocactus tepelmemensis, commonly known as the Tepelmeme cactus, is a unique species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stem and a single, thick, ribbed areola where flowers emerge. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The Tepelmeme cactus is also known for its slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance."
