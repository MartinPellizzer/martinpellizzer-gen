    "intro": "Tapinanthus rubiginosus, commonly known as the parasitic flowering plant or the Indian balm, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant has small, yellowish-green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. It lacks true roots and instead attaches to its host through haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
