It is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late autumn. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to produce vibrant red, pink, or white blooms."
