    "intro": "Trichopilia dalstroemii, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single spike of flowers that can be up to 10 centimeters in length. Trichopilia dalstroemii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
