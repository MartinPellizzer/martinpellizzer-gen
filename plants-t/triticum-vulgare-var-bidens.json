    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. bidens, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelet clusters that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical significance in the domestication of wheat."
