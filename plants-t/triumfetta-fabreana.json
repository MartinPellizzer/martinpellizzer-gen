It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Triumfetta fabreana is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to various environmental conditions."
