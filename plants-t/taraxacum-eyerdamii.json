    "intro": "Taraxacum eyerdamii, commonly known as the Eyerdaum's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The flower head produces a crown of fluffy white seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is a perennial species, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
