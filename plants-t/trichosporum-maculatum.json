    "intro": "Trichosporum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted beard lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with a dark green to brown upper surface and a lighter, often white or yellowish lower surface. The thallus is composed of a dense mat of filaments, and the plant lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. This species is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions."
