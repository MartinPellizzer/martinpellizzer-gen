    "intro": "Trasus limosus, commonly known as the swamp thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils, often near streams, marshes, and other waterlogged areas. The plant features a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its wet habitat. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. Trasus limosus is adapted to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic species of riparian zones."
