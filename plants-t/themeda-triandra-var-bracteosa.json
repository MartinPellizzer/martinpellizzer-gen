    "intro": "Themeda triandra var. bracteosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass or bracteosa grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
