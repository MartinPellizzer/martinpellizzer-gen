    "intro": "Telis stellata, commonly known as the star-flowered telis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. Telis stellata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and low maintenance requirements."
