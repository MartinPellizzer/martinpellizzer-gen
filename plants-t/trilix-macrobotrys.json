    "intro": "Trilix macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has a trailing growth habit and produces long, slender leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Trilix macrobotrys is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
