    "intro": "Tragacantha paucijuga, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods containing small, hard seeds. It is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. Tragacantha paucijuga is also valued for its resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
