It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a tall stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, making it a striking feature in its habitat. The flowers bloom in early summer and are pollinated by insects, contributing to the plant's ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
