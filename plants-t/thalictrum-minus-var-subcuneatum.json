    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. subcuneatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on tall, slender flowering stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
