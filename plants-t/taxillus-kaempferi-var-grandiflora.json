    "intro": "Taxillus kaempferi var. grandiflora, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of epiphytic plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain green throughout the year, with a distinctive fiddlehead curl at the base of each frond. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
