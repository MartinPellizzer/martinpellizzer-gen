    "intro": "Trigonochilum macropus, commonly known as the large-flowered rock orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a unique trident-shaped lip. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its morphology includes long, narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and conservationists."
