    "intro": "Trimelopter costatulum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Tmesipteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, with each frond splitting into two at right angles. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, arranged in a compact, rosette-like formation. Trimelopter costatulum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
