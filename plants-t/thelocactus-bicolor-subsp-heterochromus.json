    "intro": "Thelocactus bicolor subsp. heterochromus, commonly known as the heterochromous thlocactus, is a rare cactus species native to a specific region in Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed stems that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its foliage. Its subspecies status highlights its unique color variations, which are more pronounced than in the typical form of Thelocactus bicolor. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
