    "intro": "Tillandsia bracteata, commonly known as the silver vellum tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence that helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. Tillandsia bracteata produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
