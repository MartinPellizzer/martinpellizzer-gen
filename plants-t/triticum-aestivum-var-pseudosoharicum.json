    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. pseudosoharicum, commonly known as the pseudosoharic wheat, is a wild relative of common wheat. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, tough grains, which are typically harvested for seed. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses."
