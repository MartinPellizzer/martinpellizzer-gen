    "intro": "Triticum sativum subsp. dicoccum, commonly known as einkorn wheat, is an ancient grain species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its small, spikelet-like inflorescence and compact, awned spikelets that contain individual grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system. Its flowers are monoecious, with both male and female reproductive structures present on the same plant. Einkorn wheat is known for its high protein content and unique nutritional profile, making it a valuable crop in both historical and modern agricultural contexts."
