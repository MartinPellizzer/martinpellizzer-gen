    "intro": "Tillaea rivularis, commonly known as the stream tillaea, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils along streams and rivers, where it thrives in moist, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. Tillaea rivularis is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
