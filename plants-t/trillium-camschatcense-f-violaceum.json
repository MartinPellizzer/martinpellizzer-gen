    "intro": "Trillium camschatcense f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered white trillium, is a rare and striking botanical variant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This fern-like perennial features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with three white petals and three violet sepals, creating a striking contrast. It blooms in early spring, often before its leaves are fully unfurled, and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
