    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. aestivum, commonly known as wheat, is a major cereal grain with a complex botanical structure. It is an annual grass with slender, hollow stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which develop into grains enclosed in a hull. Its seeds, or grains, are the economically important part, used for flour, bread, and other food products. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
