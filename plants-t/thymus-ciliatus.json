    "intro": "Thymus ciliatus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact, creeping stems covered in dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus ciliatus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
