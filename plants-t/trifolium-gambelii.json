    "intro": "Trifolium gambelii, commonly known as Gambel's white clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Gambel's white clover is a nitrogen-fixing plant, making it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
