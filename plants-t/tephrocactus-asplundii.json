    "intro": "Tephrocactus asplundii, commonly known as the Asplund's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features a cylindrical stem covered in a thick, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, emerging from the stem during the warmer months. Tephrocactus asplundii is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
