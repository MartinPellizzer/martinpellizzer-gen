    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 invisus, commonly known as the invisible thyme, is a hybrid species within the genus Thymus, characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, emitting a subtle thyme scent when crushed. Thymus \u00d7 invisus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
