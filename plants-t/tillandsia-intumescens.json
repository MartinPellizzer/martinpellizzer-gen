    "intro": "Tillandsia intumescens, commonly known as the football orchid, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. The plant is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a compact, football-like structure. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. Tillandsia intumescens is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
