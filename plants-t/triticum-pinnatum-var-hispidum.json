    "intro": "Triticum pinnatum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in loose panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its fibrous roots make it a hardy, drought-resistant species often found in disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
