    "intro": "Tragacantha scoparia, commonly known as the Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal variations."
