    "intro": "Trichopilia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian hairroot, is a rare and unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
