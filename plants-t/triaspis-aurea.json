    "intro": "Triaspis aurea, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Triaspis aurea is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
