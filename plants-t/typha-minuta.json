    "intro": "Typha minuta, commonly known as the narrowleaf cattail, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and pond edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, contributing to the structure and stability of wetland ecosystems. Typha minuta plays a vital role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
