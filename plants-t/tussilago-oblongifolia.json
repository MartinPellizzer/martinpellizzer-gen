    "intro": "Tussilago oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved coughwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, often forming a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Tussilago oblongifolia is often found in association with other early-successional plants in disturbed or wetland habitats."
