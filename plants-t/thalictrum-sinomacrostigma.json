    "intro": "Thalictrum sinomacrostigma, commonly known as the Chinese meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant collections and ecological landscapes."
