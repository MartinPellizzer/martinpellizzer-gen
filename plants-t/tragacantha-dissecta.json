    "intro": "Tragacantha dissecta, commonly known as the Persian gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely dissected leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, pale yellow pods containing seeds. Its latex sap, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals. The plant is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils."
