    "intro": "Tapinanthus berliniicola, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which help attract pollinators. Its leaves are alternate and heart-shaped, and it often grows in association with other plants such as grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain environments."
