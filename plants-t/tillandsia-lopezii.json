    "intro": "Tillandsia lopezii, commonly known as the Lopez's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
