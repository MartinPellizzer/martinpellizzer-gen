    "intro": "Thlaspi caerulescens subsp. calaminare, commonly known as the leadplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals such as lead and zinc, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in urban or industrial areas. Its botanical features include alternate, pinnately divided leaves and a short, upright stem."
