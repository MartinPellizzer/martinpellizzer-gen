    "intro": "Troximon glaucum, commonly known as the blue-gray spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, blue-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant has a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
