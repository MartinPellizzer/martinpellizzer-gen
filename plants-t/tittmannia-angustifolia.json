    "intro": "Tittmannia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tittmannia, is a herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetland or swampy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
