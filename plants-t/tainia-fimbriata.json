    "intro": "Tainia fimbriata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with intricate, lace-like patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it to the substrate. Tainia fimbriata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, semi-shaded conditions."
