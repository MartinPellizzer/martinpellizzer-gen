    "intro": "Tectaria waterlotii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into smaller, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are usually short and horizontal, anchoring it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. Tectaria waterlotii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
