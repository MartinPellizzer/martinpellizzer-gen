    "intro": "Tillandsia deflexa, commonly known as the Flexed Air Plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia deflexa produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring regular misting and indirect sunlight to thrive."
