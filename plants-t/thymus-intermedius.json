    "intro": "Thymus intermedius, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems, often forming a mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus intermedius is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies and culinary applications."
