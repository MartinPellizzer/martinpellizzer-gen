    "intro": "Trifolium recurvum, commonly known as the curlleaf clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in early spring. Trifolium recurvum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
