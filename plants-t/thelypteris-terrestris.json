    "intro": "Thelypteris terrestris, commonly known as the ground fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and dense, low-growing fronds. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth pattern, with lanceolate to ovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Thelypteris terrestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in forest ecosystems."
