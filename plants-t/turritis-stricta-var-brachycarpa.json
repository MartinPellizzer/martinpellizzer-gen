    "intro": "Turritis stricta var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited turritis, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its fruit is distinctive, being short and broad, which gives it the specific epithet *brachycarpa*. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
