    "intro": "Thalictrum lentiginosum, commonly known as the spotted meadow-rue, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in compound umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Thalictrum lentiginosum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats."
