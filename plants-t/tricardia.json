These plants are characterized by their distinctive three-lobed petals and sepals, which give them their common name. Tricardia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in shaded, moist environments. They have a short, stocky stem and produce small, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
