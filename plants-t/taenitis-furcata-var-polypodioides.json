    "intro": "Taenitis furcata var. polypodioides, commonly known as the Polypody fern, is a tropical fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or on rocky surfaces, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a light green color and a soft texture. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
