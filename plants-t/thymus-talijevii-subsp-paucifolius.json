    "intro": "Thymus talijevii subsp. paucifolius, commonly known as the rare Alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and compact growth habit, typical of many thyme species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
