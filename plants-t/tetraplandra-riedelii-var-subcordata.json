    "intro": "Tetraplandra riedelii var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-heart fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the forest floor. Its foliage is often a deep green, with a slightly waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in humid environments. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
