    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly thymol and carvacrol. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to its more common relative, Thymus vulgaris."
