    "intro": "Trifolium repens subsp. ochranthum, commonly known as white clover, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It is a legume, capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale-colored flowers and slightly hairy stems compared to other white clover varieties."
