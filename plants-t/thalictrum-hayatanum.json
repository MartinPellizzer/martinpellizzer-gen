    "intro": "Thalictrum hayatanum, commonly known as the Hayata's meadow rue, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Thalictrum hayatanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
