    "intro": "Thalictrum pubescens var. matritense, commonly known as the Madrid rue-anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to central Spain. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces achenes as its fruit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
