    "intro": "Thymus karatavicus, commonly known as Karatavsky thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and digestive properties. Thymus karatavicus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
