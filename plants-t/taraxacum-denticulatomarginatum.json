    "intro": "Taraxacum denticulatomarginatum, commonly known as the toothed-margin dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that bears a bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed head with white, feathery seeds. It is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. This species is noted for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
