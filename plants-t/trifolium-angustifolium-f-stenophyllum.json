    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium f. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved white clover, is a botanical variant of the common white clover. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, pale white flowers compared to the typical form. This subspecies is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and pastures. Its foliage is typically more compact, making it distinct from other clover varieties. It is valued in agriculture for its nitrogen-fixing ability and as a forage crop."
