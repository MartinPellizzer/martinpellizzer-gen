    "intro": "Triticum sylvestre, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that contain numerous tiny grains. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value."
