    "intro": "Taraxacum pallidipes, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
