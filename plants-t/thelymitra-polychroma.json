    "intro": "Thelymitra polychroma, commonly known as the rainbow leek, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a bulb-like structure called a tunicate bulb, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces a single, narrow leaf and has a distinctive inflorescence with multiple flowers in various colors, including pink, purple, and white. Its flowers are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Thelymitra polychroma is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
