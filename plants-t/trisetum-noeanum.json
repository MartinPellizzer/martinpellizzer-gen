    "intro": "Trisetum noeanum, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Trisetum noeanum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
