    "intro": "Trichomanes cornutum, commonly known as the horned fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllum family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, curled appearance. Trichomanes cornutum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
