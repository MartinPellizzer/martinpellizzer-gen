    "intro": "Turnera oblongifolia, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a member of the Passifloraceae family, which includes other well-known plants like passionflowers. The plant is characterized by its striking orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the evening. Turnera oblongifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
