    "intro": "Thismia labiata, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients. The plant produces striking, pinkish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is typically found growing epiphytically on tree trunks or branches in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
