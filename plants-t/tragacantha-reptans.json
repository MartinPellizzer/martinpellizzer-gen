    "intro": "Tragacantha reptans, commonly known as the creeping tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its spreading growth habit, with slender, woody stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Tragacantha reptans is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
