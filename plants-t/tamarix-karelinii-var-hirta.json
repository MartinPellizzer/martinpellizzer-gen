    "intro": "Tamarix karelinii var. hirta, commonly known as the woolly tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, often spiny branches and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in small, spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for stabilizing sandy soils. Its rapid growth and salt tolerance make it a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
