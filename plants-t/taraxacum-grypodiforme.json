    "intro": "Taraxacum grypodiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of both ray and disk florets, which develop into a distinctive spherical seed head with pappus structures for wind dispersal. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This species is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
