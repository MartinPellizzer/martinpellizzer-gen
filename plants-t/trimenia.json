    "intro": "Trimenia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with simple, opposite leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. The wood of some species is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color. However, many species are threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
