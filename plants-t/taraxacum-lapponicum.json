    "intro": "Taraxacum lapponicum, commonly known as the Lapland dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow, stem that rises to bear a yellow flowering head, which develops into a white, fluffy seed sphere. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, tundra, and roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soils."
