    "intro": "Triorchis linearis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in a dense spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Triorchis linearis is often found growing in association with other orchids, forming dense colonies in its natural habitat."
