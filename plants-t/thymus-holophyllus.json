    "intro": "Thymus holophyllus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-blue foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Woolly thyme is valued for its aromatic leaves and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
