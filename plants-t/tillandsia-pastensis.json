    "intro": "Tillandsia pastensis, commonly known as the Pastensia air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it absorb moisture from the air. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia. Tillandsia pastensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to thrive."
