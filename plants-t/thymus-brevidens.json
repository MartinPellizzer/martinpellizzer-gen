    "intro": "Thymus brevidens, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed along its creeping stems. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is often used in cooking and traditional medicine due to its essential oils and antiseptic properties."
