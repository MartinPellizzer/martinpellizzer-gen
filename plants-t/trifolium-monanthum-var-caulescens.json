It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
