    "intro": "Trema virgatum var. pubigerum, commonly known as the hairy trema, is a variant of the trema plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, ovate leaves. The leaves are typically pubescent, with a fine, hairy texture that distinguishes this variety from other trema species. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks."
