    "intro": "Tragia saxicola, commonly known as the rock tragia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Tragia saxicola plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain insects."
