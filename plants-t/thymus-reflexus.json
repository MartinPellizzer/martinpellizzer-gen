    "intro": "Thymus reflexus, commonly known as reflexed thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant features small, fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Thymus reflexus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in herbal remedies."
