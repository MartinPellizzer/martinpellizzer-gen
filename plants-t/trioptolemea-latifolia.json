    "intro": "Trioptolemea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf trioptolemea, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its growth habit is generally herbaceous, with a tendency to form dense clusters or shrubs depending on environmental conditions. Trioptolemea latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its foliage and unique floral structure."
