    "intro": "Thymus douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Douglas's thyme is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun."
