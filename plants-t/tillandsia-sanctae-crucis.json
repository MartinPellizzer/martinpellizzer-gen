    "intro": "Tillandsia sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Cross of Christ airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking orange or red flowers that bloom from a central stem. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
