    "intro": "Thelypteris falciloba var. latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous growth habit, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a broad, rounded base and a tapering tip, and are often divided into segments. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. This plant exhibits a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are dispersed by wind to propagate new growth."
