    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoleucanthum, commonly known as the whitehead dandelion, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and lobed, and its stem supports the flowering head. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, which is a feathery structure attached to each seed. This species is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
