It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a yellow composite flower head. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures, typical of the dandelion genus. Taraxacum larssonii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
