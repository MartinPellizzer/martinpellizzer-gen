    "intro": "Tillandsia caloura, commonly known as the Caloura air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
