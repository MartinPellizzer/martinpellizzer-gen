It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Thalictrum mediterraneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and adding visual interest to gardens."
