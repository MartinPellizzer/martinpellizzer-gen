    "intro": "Tragacantha dodtii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature among members of its family. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Tragacantha dodtii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
