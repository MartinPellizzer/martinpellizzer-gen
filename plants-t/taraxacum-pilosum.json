    "intro": "Taraxacum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other dandelion species. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Taraxacum pilosum is often found in grassy areas, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
