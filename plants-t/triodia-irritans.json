    "intro": "Triodia irritans, commonly known as the irritant triodia, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Triodia irritans is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
