It has a conical shape with dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing some resistance to pests and diseases. Taxus pyramidalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
