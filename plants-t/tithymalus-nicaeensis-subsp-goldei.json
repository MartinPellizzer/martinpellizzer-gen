    "intro": "Tithymalus nicaeensis subsp. goldei, commonly known as the golden tithymalus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its flowering stems are upright and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
