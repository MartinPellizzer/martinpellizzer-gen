    "intro": "Theodorea stracheyana, commonly known as the Strachey's orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers often display vibrant hues of purple and yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
