    "intro": "Tovomita foldatsii, commonly known as the Malagasy bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Tovomita foldatsii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
