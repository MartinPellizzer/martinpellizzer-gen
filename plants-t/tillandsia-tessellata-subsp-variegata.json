    "intro": "Tillandsia tessellata subsp. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Air Plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette, with a distinctive variegated pattern of green and silver. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom after the plant has matured. It is popular as a decorative plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
