    "intro": "Triticum compactum var. erinaceum, commonly known as the hairy wheat, is a botanical variant of the wheat species Triticum compactum. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other wheat varieties. This plant typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in regions with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. The hairy wheat is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential agricultural applications."
