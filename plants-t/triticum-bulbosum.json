    "intro": "Triticum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of bulb-like structures at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often thrives in well-drained soils. Triticum bulbosum is primarily of ornamental value but has also been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
