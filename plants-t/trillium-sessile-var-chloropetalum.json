    "intro": "Trillium sessile var. chloropetalum, commonly known as the chloropetalum trillium, is a rare and striking woodland plant characterized by its unique botanical features. It possesses three large, waxy, greenish-yellow petals that are often tinged with red, distinguishing it from other trillium species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in acidic soil conditions. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in early spring, adding a distinctive visual element to the forest understory."
