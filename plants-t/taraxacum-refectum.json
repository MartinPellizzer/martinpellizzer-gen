    "intro": "Taraxacum refectum, commonly known as the edible dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, ridged stem that supports a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a feathery pappus, allowing for wind-assisted propagation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The entire plant is edible, with the young leaves being particularly tender and nutritious."
