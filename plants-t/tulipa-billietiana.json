    "intro": "Tulipa billietiana, commonly known as the Billiet's tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive white or yellow throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a challenging but rewarding addition to specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
