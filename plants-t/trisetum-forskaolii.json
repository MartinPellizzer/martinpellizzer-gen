It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Trisetum forskaolii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
