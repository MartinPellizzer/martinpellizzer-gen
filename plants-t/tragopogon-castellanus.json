    "intro": "Tragopogon castellanus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a tall, flowering stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and alpine environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Tragopogon castellanus is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means."
