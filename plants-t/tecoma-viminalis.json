    "intro": "Tecoma viminalis, commonly known as the yellow bells, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Tecoma viminalis is also valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
