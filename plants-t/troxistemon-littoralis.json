    "intro": "Troxistemon littoralis, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Troxistemon littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
