    "intro": "Trachypteris aureonitens, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden-brown pubescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The golden shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
