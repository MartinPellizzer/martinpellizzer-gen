    "intro": "Tithymalus gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant is adapted to grow in poor, calcareous soils, often found on limestone or gypsum substrates. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specialized habitat, Tithymalus gypsicola is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
