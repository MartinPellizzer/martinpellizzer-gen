    "intro": "Taraxacum vigens, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy white pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. This plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
