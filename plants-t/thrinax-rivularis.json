    "intro": "Thrinax rivularis, commonly known as the river palm, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its slender, palm-like stems and feather-like leaves. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and moist soils, which contribute to its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or yellow and are followed by small, round fruits. Thrinax rivularis is adapted to humid tropical climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
