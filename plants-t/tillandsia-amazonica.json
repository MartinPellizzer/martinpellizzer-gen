    "intro": "Tillandsia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses dense, fibrous roots that help anchor it to its host and absorb moisture from the air. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a thick layer of trichomes, which aid in water retention. Native to the rainforests of South America, it thrives in humid, tropical environments."
