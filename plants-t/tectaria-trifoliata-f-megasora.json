    "intro": "Tectaria trifoliata f. megasora, commonly known as the giant fern, is a variant of the common tectaria species. It is a large, terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach several meters in length. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the plant's growth and enabling it to store moisture. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores."
