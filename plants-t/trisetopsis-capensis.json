    "intro": "Trisetopsis capensis, commonly known as the Cape dandelion, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Trisetopsis capensis is often used in ornamental gardening for its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
