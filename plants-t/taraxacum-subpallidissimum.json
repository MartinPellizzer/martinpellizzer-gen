    "intro": "Taraxacum subpallidissimum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, elongated stems and yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Native to Central Asia, this plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
