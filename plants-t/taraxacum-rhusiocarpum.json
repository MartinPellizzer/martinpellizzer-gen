    "intro": "Taraxacum rhusiocarpum, commonly known as the yellow starburry dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and a basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-covered seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread efficiently."
