    "intro": "Trachypleurum, commonly known as the glassworts, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are typically found in saline or brackish environments, such as coastal areas and salt marshes. Trachypleurum species are adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them important components of coastal ecosystems."
