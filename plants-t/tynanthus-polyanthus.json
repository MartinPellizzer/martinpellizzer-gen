    "intro": "Tynanthus polyanthus, commonly known as the Chinese lantern vine, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking, papery orange to red bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often hidden beneath the colorful bracts. It is a deciduous vine that thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Tynanthus polyanthus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
