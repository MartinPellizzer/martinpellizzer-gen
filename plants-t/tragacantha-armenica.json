    "intro": "Tragacantha armenica, commonly known as Armenian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its sap is known for its high mucilage content, which has been traditionally used in medicine and as a natural thickening agent. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in arid and semi-arid environments."
