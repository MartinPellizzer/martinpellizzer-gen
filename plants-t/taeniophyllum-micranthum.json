    "intro": "Taeniophyllum micranthum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale green, adapted for pollination by small insects. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
