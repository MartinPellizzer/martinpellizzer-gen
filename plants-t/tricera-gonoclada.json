    "intro": "Tricera gonoclada, commonly known as the spiral-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its leaves are compound, with long, narrow leaflets that are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem. Tricera gonoclada produces cones, with the female cones typically appearing at the base of the plant and the male cones emerging from the upper part of the stem."
