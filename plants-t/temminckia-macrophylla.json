    "intro": "Temminckia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant, and its flowers are typically white or pink, emerging above the water. It thrives in warm, shallow waters with abundant sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental ponds. Due to its size and beauty, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
