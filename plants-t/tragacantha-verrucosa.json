    "intro": "Tragacantha verrucosa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are typically small, leathery, and arranged alternately along the branches. Tragacantha verrucosa is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high temperatures and limited water availability."
