    "intro": "Thymus liaculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear, with a dense mat-forming habit. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
