    "intro": "Trixago scordifolia, commonly known as the stinking sprangletop, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Trixago scordifolia is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its pungent scent and tough, fibrous texture."
