    "intro": "Thymus moesiacus var. adpressus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens and as a ground cover. The essential oils of this variety are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
