    "intro": "Trifolium nigrocinctum, commonly known as the black-bordered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, with the central one often bearing a distinctive black or dark purple margin. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, and it is often found in meadows and grasslands. Trifolium nigrocinctum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
