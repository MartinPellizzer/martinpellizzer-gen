    "intro": "Tigridia venusta, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of many Amaryllidaceae species. Tigridia venusta thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
