    "intro": "Tinus icara, commonly known as the blue-tailed day gecko, is a small, arboreal lizard native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant blue tail, which serves as a distraction mechanism to escape predators. The gecko's body is covered in short, spiny scales that provide protection and aid in climbing. It primarily feeds on insects and small invertebrates, using its long, sticky tongue to capture prey. Due to habitat loss and the pet trade, Tinus icara is considered a vulnerable species."
