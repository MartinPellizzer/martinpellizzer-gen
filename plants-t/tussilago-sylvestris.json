    "intro": "Tussilago sylvestris, commonly known as coltsfoot, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that emerge before the flowering stems, which bear yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near streams or in meadows. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Coltsfoot has a long history of medicinal use, particularly for respiratory ailments."
