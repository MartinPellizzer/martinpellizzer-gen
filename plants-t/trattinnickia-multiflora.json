    "intro": "Trattinnickia multiflora, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Trattinnickia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
