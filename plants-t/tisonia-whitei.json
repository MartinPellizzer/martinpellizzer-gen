    "intro": "Tisonia whitei, commonly known as the white tisonia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to habitat loss, Tisonia whitei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
