    "intro": "Tachigali alba, commonly known as white tachigali, is a small to medium-sized tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The tree is known for its white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
