It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
