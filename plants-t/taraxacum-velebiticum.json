    "intro": "Taraxacum velebiticum, commonly known as the Velebit dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula, particularly Croatia. It belongs to the dandelion genus, characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafy stem. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower that develops into a fluffy white seed head. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
