    "intro": "Tilia fulvosa, commonly known as the yellow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in pendulous inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia fulvosa is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
