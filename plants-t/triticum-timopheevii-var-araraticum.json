It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a rough, hairy texture. It plays an important role in genetic research due to its potential for improving wheat resilience to environmental stresses."
