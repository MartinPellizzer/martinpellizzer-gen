    "intro": "Trichilia distini, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes many species known for their aromatic wood. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and are usually white or pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
