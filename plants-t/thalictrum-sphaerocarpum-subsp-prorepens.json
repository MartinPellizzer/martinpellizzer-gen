It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
