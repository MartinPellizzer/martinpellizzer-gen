    "intro": "Trifolium anomalum, commonly known as the rare clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three leaflets, which are typically bright green and oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, Trifolium anomalum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
