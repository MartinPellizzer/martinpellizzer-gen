    "intro": "Triglochin linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf glassworts, is a halophyte plant that thrives in saline or brackish wetlands. It has succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its root system is adapted to tolerate high salt concentrations and waterlogged soils. Triglochin linearis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and marsh ecosystems."
