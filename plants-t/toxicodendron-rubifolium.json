    "intro": "Toxicodendron rubifolium, commonly known as the red-leaf poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a reddish tint, and small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause severe skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often in woodland areas and along forest edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid contact with the skin."
