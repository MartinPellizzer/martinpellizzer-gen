    "intro": "Tulipa ivasczenkoae, commonly known as the Ivasczenko tulip, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from deep red to orange, with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are broad and slightly hairy, adapting to its arid environment. It blooms in late spring and is often found in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
