    "intro": "Tium inyoense, commonly known as the Inyo tium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale blue to purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its high-altitude habitat. It is considered a sensitive indicator species for environmental changes due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and endangered species from habitat loss and climate change impacts."
