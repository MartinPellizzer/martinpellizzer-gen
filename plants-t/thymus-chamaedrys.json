    "intro": "Thymus chamaedrys, commonly known as wild thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves and pink or violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit, often forming dense carpets on rocky or sandy soils. It is widely used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a culinary herb. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
