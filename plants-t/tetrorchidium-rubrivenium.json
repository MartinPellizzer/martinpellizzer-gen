    "intro": "Tetrorchidium rubrivenium, commonly known as the red-veined tetrorchidium, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety petals that display a deep red hue with contrasting veins, making it highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its flowering period typically occurs during the late spring to early summer months, producing clusters of fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
