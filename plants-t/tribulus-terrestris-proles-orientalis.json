    "intro": "Tribulus terrestris proles orientalis, commonly known as oriental puncture vine, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers and produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
