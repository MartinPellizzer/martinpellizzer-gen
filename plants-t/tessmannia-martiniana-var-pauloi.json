    "intro": "Tessmannia martiniana var. pauloi, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
