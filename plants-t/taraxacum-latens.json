    "intro": "Taraxacum latens, commonly known as the creeping dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, inconspicuous yellow flower. The plant produces a capsule that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. Taraxacum latens is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
