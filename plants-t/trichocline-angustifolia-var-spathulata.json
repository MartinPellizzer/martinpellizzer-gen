It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along streambanks."
