    "intro": "Tounatea longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved tounatea, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Tounatea longifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
