    "intro": "Tococa bullifera, commonly known as the Amazonian coffee plant, is a shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white flowers that give way to red, fleshy berries. Its fruit contains seeds that are used to make a stimulating beverage similar to coffee. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the Amazon basin."
