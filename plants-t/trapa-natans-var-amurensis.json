    "intro": "Trapa natans var. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are deeply lobed and its distinctive spiny fruits. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky shell, which aids in seed dispersal."
