    "intro": "Tinea, commonly known as ringworm, is a fungal infection that affects the skin, hair, and nails rather than a plant. It is caused by dermatophytes, a group of fungi that thrive on keratin found in these tissues. Unlike plants, tinea does not have roots, stems, or leaves, and it is not a botanical organism. The term \"tinea\" comes from the Latin word for \"wound,\" reflecting its characteristic ring-shaped lesions. While it is not a plant, it is sometimes mistaken for a botanical term due to its name."
