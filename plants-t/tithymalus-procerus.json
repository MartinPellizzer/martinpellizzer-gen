    "intro": "Tithymalus procerus, commonly known as the tall tithymalus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland edges or meadows. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties. Tithymalus procerus is relatively rare and is often considered a species of conservation concern in its native range."
