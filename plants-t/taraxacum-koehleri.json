    "intro": "Taraxacum koehleri, commonly known as the Koehler's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
