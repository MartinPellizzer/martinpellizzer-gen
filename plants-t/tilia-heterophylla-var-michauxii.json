It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by bees and other insects. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
