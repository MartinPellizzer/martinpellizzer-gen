    "intro": "Tecoma argentea, commonly known as silver trumpet bush, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, silver-gray flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Its woody stems are typically covered in a thick, corky layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Tecoma argentea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
