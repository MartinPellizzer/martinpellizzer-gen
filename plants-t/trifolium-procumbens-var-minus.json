    "intro": "Trifolium procumbens var. minus, commonly known as the lesser creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
