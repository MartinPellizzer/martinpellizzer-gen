    "intro": "Terminalia brandisii, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its fruit is edible and often consumed raw or cooked, while the bark has been used in traditional medicine. Terminalia brandisii plays an important role in local ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and utilitarian properties."
