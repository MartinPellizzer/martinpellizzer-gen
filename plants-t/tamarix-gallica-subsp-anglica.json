It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in nutrients. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and in dry, sandy habitats. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
