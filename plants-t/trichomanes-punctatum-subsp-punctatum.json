    "intro": "Trichomanes punctatum subsp. punctatum, commonly known as the punctate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. This fern is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
