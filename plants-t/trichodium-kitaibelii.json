    "intro": "Trichodium kitaibelii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Trichodium kitaibelii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
