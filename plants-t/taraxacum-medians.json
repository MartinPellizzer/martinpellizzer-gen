    "intro": "Taraxacum medians, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive seed head, or pappus, consisting of feathery bristles that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum medians is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties."
