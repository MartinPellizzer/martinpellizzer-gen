    "intro": "Taraxacum officinarum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, hollow-stemmed flower head that turns into a sphere of white seeds with parachute-like structures for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. The dandelion is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
