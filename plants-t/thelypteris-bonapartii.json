    "intro": "Thelypteris bonapartii, commonly known as the Bonaparte's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that form a compact, shield-like cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
