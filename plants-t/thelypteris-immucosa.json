    "intro": "Thelypteris immucosa, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a stag, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes without deriving nutrients from its host. Its fronds are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves that produce spores. Thelypteris immucosa thrives in humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
