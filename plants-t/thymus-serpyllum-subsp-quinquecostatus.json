    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. quinquecostatus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical T. serpyllum."
