    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. majus, commonly known as the greater red clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink to purple flower heads that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. It plays an important role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Its flowers are also used in traditional herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
