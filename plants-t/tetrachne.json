    "intro": "Tetrachne, commonly known as the four-row grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences that typically consist of spikelets. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in dry, open habitats. Tetrachne species are generally herbaceous and have a fibrous root system. They play a minor role in ecological systems but are not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
