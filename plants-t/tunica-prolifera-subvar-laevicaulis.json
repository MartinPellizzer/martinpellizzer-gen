    "intro": "Tunica prolifera subvar. laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth tunica, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of North America. It features a dense, low-growing mat of fleshy, cylindrical stems that are covered in a smooth, waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to scales, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and can survive prolonged periods of drought."
