    "intro": "Trifolium buckwestiorum, commonly known as the Buckwheat clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve fertility. Additionally, it serves as a food source for various pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
