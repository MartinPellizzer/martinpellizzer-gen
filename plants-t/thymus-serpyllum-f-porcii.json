    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. porcii, commonly known as the pig thyme or porcine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and aromatic, small, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tiny, pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in whorls along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant ground cover. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species."
