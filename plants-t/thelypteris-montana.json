    "intro": "Thelypteris montana, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a robust rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
