    "intro": "Thelypteris todayensis, commonly known as the Today's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters known as sori. Thelypteris todayensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests and along stream banks. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
