    "intro": "Thymus multiflorus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces clusters of tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for ground cover in rock gardens or along pathways. Thymus multiflorus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and versatile plant for gardeners."
