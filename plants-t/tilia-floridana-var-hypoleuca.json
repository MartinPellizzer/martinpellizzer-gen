    "intro": "Tilia floridana var. hypoleuca, commonly known as the white-flowered basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bottomlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and its role in supporting local wildlife."
