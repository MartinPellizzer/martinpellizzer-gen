    "intro": "Thelypteris neohibernica, commonly known as the New Ireland holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated pinnae. The plant produces spores in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Thelypteris neohibernica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
