    "intro": "Talbotiella breteleri, commonly known as the Cape York lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its striking white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous base, and it thrives in well-drained sandy soils. It is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of its native region, with a preference for full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
