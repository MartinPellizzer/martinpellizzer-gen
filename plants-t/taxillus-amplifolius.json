    "intro": "Taxillus amplifolius, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using its small leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its parasitic nature makes it an important ecological component in certain forest ecosystems. However, it can also be a threat to the health of its host trees if left unchecked."
