    "intro": "Trisetum morisii, commonly known as the Moris' hairgrass, is a species of grass native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Trisetum morisii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
