    "intro": "Trifolium panormitanum var. aequidentatum, commonly known as the Panormitanum clover, is a rare and endemic species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being nearly identical in size and shape, giving it a symmetrical appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
