The plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like blades and a short, stout stem. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for ecological or agricultural study."
