    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens subvar. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow false brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and forest edges. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, yellowish-green spikelets. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
