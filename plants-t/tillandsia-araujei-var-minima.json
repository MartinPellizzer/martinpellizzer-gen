    "intro": "Tillandsia araujei var. minima, commonly known as the miniature tillandsia, is a small epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
