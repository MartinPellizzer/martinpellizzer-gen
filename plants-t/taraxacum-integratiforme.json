    "intro": "Taraxacum integratiforme, commonly known as the integrated dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy, and often blue-green leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, prominent flower head composed of yellow ray florets. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by the formation of a distinctive seed head known as a pappus. This species is native to parts of Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
