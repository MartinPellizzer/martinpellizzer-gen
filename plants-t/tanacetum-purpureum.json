    "intro": "Tanacetum purpureum, commonly known as purple tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive silvery-green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are arranged in flat, circular clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Purple tansy is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is often found in dry meadows and disturbed soils. It has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties."
