    "intro": "Taraxacum semilatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, hollow stem that supports a bright yellow flower head, which later develops into a spherical seed sphere with white pappus. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in temperate regions and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
