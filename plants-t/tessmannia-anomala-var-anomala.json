    "intro": "Tessmannia anomala var. anomala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tessmannia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, blooming during the cooler months. Its fibrous roots make it well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
