    "intro": "Thelypteris repens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, often bipinnate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
