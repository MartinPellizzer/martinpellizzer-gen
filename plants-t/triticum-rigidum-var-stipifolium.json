    "intro": "Triticum rigidum var. stipifolium, commonly known as rigid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, stiff appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, often in rocky or disturbed soils. This species is sometimes used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
