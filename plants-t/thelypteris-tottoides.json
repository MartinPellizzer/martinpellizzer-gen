    "intro": "Thelypteris tottoides, commonly known as the Tott's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a network of roots that help stabilize soil and absorb nutrients. Thelypteris tottoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
