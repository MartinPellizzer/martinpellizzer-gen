    "intro": "Tropalanthe comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Tropalanthe comptonii is valued for its resilience and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
