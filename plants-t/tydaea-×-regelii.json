    "intro": "Tydaea \u00d7 regelii, commonly known as the Regel's tamarisk, is a hybrid shrub native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Tamaricaceae family and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with dry climates."
