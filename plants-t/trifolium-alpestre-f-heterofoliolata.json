    "intro": "Trifolium alpestre f. heterofoliolata, commonly known as the alpine clover, is a variant of the alpine clover species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. This plant is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, typically growing in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three leaflets, but the f. heterofoliolata form exhibits variation in leaflet size and shape, often with one leaflet being notably larger than the others. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or white, and it is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in alpine areas."
