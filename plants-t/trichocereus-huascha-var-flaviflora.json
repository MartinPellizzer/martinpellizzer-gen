    "intro": "Trichocereus huascha var. flaviflora, commonly known as the \"Chili Pepper Cactus,\" is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem and produces striking yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This cactus is also valued for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline in its alkaloids."
