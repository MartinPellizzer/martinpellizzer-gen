    "intro": "Taraxacum qirae, commonly known as the Qira dandelion, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of China, particularly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features a rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Taraxacum qirae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
