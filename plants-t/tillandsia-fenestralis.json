    "intro": "Tillandsia fenestralis, commonly known as the window tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tillandsia fenestralis is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
