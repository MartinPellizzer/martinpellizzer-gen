    "intro": "Tiarella trifoliata var. unifoliata, commonly known as the Japanese foamflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Japan. It features delicate, waxy, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a compact growth habit with trifoliate or unifoliate leaves depending on the variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and early blooming period, which adds interest during the spring season."
