    "intro": "Trigonella ornithopodioides, commonly known as the desert fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep root systems and a short growing season. Trigonella ornithopodioides is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
