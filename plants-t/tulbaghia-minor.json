    "intro": "Tulbaghia minor, commonly known as the Cape garlic, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a compact, low-growing form with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its strong garlic-like scent is particularly noticeable when crushed."
