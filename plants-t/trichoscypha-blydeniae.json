    "intro": "Trichoscypha blydeniae, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries containing three to five seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species."
