    "intro": "Tococa bullifera var. luetzelburgii, commonly known as the Amazonian cocoa tree, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and elongated, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds used in traditional chocolate production. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a key component of the Amazonian ecosystem and its economic importance in local communities. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for optimal growth."
