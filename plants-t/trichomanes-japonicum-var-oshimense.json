    "intro": "Trichomanes japonicum var. oshimense, commonly known as the Oshimeno water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern genus Trichomanes. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in the understory of temperate forests. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
