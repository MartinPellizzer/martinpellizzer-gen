    "intro": "Tamarix macrocarpa, commonly known as the coastal tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive and can stabilize soil, often found in coastal and saline areas. Tamarix macrocarpa is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand harsh climatic conditions."
