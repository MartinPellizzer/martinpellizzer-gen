    "intro": "Taraxacum semiundulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, wavy-edged leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, hollow stem topped with a spherical flower head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. This species is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils."
