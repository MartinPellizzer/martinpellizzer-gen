    "intro": "Tirucalia aspericaulis, commonly known as the rough-leaved tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its rough, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing edible, sour-tasting seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, open forests and along roadsides. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dye."
