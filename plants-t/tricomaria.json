    "intro": "Tricomaria, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"Tricomaria,\" derived from the Greek words \"trikos\" meaning three and \"m\u0113ros\" meaning part, referring to its three-part structure. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Tricomaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
