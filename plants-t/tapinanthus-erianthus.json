    "intro": "Tapinanthus erianthus, commonly known as the tropical dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color, typical of many parasitic species. The plant's roots are specialized for attaching to the host, and it can spread through seeds or vegetatively. It is native to tropical regions and is often found on various host plants such as shrubs and trees. Its botanical structure is adapted for a hemiparasitic lifestyle, with a reduced root system and a highly branched stem."
