    "intro": "Thelypteris camerounensis, commonly known as the Cameroon water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of sporangia used for spore dispersal. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that aids in its identification."
