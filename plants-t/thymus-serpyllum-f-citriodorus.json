    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. citriodorus, commonly known as lemon thyme, is a fragrant perennial herb belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a strong lemony aroma due to the presence of citral, a compound also found in lemongrass. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This variety is often used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species."
