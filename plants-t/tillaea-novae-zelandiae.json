    "intro": "Tillaea novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand tillia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
