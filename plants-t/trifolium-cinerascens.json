    "intro": "Trifolium cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray clover, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. Trifolium cinerascens is typically found in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules."
