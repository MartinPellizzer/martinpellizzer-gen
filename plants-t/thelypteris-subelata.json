It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Thelypteris subelata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
