    "intro": "Thismia iguassuensis, commonly known as the Iguassu ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a member of the Thismiaceae family, characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fleshy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, humid environments within dense forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected in conservation reserves."
