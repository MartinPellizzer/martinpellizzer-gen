    "intro": "Telanthophora orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate member of the orchid family, native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a unique appearance, featuring a single, pale green or bluish stem that often remains hidden beneath the soil. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, which blooms in late spring. It has a complex life cycle, requiring specific environmental conditions to germinate and thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
