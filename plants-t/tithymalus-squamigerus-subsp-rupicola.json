    "intro": "Tithymalus squamigerus subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its subsp. rupicola is distinguished by its preference for rocky soils and its ability to thrive in well-drained environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local pollinator populations."
