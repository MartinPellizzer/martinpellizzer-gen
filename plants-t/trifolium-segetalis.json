    "intro": "Trifolium segetalis, commonly known as the field clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. This plant is typically found in grasslands, meadows, and agricultural fields, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Trifolium segetalis is a perennial herb that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. It is also valued for forage and as a cover crop in sustainable farming practices."
