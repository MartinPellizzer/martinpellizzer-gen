It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid rainforests of Madagascar.

Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
