    "intro": "Triglochin milnei, commonly known as the coastal marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of New Zealand. It typically grows in wet, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and its root system helps stabilize coastal soils. Triglochin milnei is adapted to withstand salt spray and fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
