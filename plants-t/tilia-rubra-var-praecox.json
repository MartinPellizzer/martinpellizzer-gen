    "intro": "Tilia rubra var. praecox, commonly known as the early-leaf bigleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that emerge early in the spring, often before the flowers appear. The leaves are typically pale green with a rough texture and turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its vibrant seasonal display."
