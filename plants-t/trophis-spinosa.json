    "intro": "Trophis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny trophis, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warmer climates."
