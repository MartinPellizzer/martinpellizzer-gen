    "intro": "Trifolium petraeum, commonly known as the rock clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that can range in color from white to purple, depending on the species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices and on rocky slopes. Trifolium petraeum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its harsh habitats."
