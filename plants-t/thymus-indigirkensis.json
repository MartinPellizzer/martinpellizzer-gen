    "intro": "Thymus indigirkensis, commonly known as the Kashmir thyme, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and pink to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Its essential oils contain thymol and other phenolic compounds, giving it a strong, pungent aroma. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
