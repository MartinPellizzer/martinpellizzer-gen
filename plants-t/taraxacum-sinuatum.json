    "intro": "Taraxacum sinuatum, commonly known as the sinuous dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, light green leaves that are slightly sinuous in shape. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive seed head known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils."
