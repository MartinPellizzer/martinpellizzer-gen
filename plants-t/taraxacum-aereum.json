It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a distinctive flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. It is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
