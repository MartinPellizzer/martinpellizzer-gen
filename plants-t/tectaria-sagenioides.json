    "intro": "Tectaria sagenioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure known as a indusium."
