    "intro": "Thymus purpurellus, commonly known as purple thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
