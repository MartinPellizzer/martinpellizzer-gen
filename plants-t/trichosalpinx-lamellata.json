It features lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period. Trichosalpinx lamellata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
