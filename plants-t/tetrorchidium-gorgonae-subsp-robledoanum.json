    "intro": "Tetrorchidium gorgonae subsp. robledoanum, commonly known as the Robledo's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often translucent floral structures, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter, reflecting its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits. Its floral morphology suggests a specialized relationship with certain pollinators, likely moths or nocturnal insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
