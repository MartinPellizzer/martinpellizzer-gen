    "intro": "Triticum repens var. nodosum, commonly known as nodose creeping wheat, is a variant of the annual grass species Triticum repens. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and the presence of nodules on its stems, which are a distinguishing feature of this variety. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological roles."
