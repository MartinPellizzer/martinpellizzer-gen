    "intro": "Tragopogon, commonly known as the goatsbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiky, yellow flower heads that resemble a goat's beard, hence the common name. They typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Tragopogon species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and some are used in traditional herbal medicine."
