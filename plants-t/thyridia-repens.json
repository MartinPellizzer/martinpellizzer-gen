    "intro": "Thyridia repens, commonly known as the creeping thyridia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Thyridia repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
