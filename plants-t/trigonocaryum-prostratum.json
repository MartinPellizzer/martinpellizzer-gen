    "intro": "Trigonocaryum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate trigonocaryum, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
