    "intro": "Tripsacum distachyum, commonly known as wild maize or bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush, composed of closely spaced spikelets. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are often arranged in pairs. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to maize and teosinte."
