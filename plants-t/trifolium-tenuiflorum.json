    "intro": "Trifolium tenuiflorum, commonly known as narrow-leaved clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and pastures. Narrow-leaved clover is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural purposes."
