    "intro": "Taraxacum verticosum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a tall, flowering stem that bears a single yellow flower head. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny environments. Due to its ecological importance, it is considered a valuable component of alpine flora."
