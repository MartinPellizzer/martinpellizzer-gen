    "intro": "Thuja orientalis var. semperaurescens, commonly known as the evergreen thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with a compact, pyramidal shape. It features scale-like leaves that are dark green and remain lush throughout the year, giving it its \"evergreen\" name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green female cones, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It is well-suited for landscaping due to its dense foliage and ability to tolerate urban conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
