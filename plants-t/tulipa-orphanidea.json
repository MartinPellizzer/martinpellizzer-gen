It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
