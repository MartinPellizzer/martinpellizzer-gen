    "intro": "Thellungiella salsuginea f. robusta, commonly known as the desert windowweed, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant exhibits remarkable tolerance to high salinity and drought, making it a model organism for studying stress responses in plants. Its small, green leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This frost-tolerant species is native to Central Asia and is used in both horticultural and scientific research contexts."
