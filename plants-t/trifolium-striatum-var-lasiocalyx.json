It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
