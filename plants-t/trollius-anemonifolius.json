    "intro": "Trollius anemonifolius, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately divided, bright green leaves that are reminiscent of anemone foliage, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Trollius anemonifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
