    "intro": "Tillandsia sublaxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia sublaxa is known for its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients through its leaves, making it well adapted to its natural habitat."
