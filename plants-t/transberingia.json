    "intro": "Transberingia, commonly known as the Trans-Beringian flora, refers to a hypothetical biogeographical region that encompasses the plant life of both North America and East Asia. This concept is based on the idea that these two continents were connected by a land bridge during the last Ice Age, allowing for the exchange of plant species. The flora of Transberingia is characterized by a mix of temperate and boreal species adapted to cold climates. Many of these plants have since become endemic to either North America or East Asia. Studying Transberingia helps scientists understand the historical distribution and evolution of plant life across the Northern Hemisphere."
