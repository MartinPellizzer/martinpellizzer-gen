    "intro": "Trichomanes pachycarpum, commonly known as the thick-fruited maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Trichomanes pachycarpum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
