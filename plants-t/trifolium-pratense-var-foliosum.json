    "intro": "Trifolium pratense var. foliosum, commonly known as the leafy clover, is a variant of red clover characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and meadows. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three leaflets, are a distinguishing feature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation."
