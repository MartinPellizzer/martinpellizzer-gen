It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its adaptability to arid environments makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
