    "intro": "Tillandsia muhrii, commonly known as the Muhrii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or pink flowers. Tillandsia muhrii is relatively easy to care for, requiring minimal water and indirect sunlight."
