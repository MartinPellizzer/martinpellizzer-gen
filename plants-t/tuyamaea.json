    "intro": "Tuyamaea, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Tuyamaea has rhizomes that help anchor it to rocky substrates and absorb nutrients. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
