    "intro": "Terpsichore athyrioides, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are leathery and have a bright yellow to golden hue on the underside, which gives it its common name. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori."
