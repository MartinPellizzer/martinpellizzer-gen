    "intro": "Taraxacum isthmicola, commonly known as the Isthmus dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elongated, hairy leaves and a flowering head composed of numerous yellow ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and a pappus-equipped seed head for wind dispersal. It is native to the Isthmus of Panama and is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
