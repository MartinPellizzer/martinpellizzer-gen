    "intro": "Taraxacum tourmalettense, commonly known as the Tourmalet dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Pyrenees, particularly in France and Spain. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a distinctive white pappus. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species within its native range."
