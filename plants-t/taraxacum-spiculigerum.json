    "intro": "Taraxacum spiculigerum, commonly known as the spiculate dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head composed of ray florets. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
