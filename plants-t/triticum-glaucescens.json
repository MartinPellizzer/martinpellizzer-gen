    "intro": "Triticum glaucescens, commonly known as the gray wheat or glaucous wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its bluish-gray leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is a diploid species with a genome size typical of other wheat species, and it has been studied for its potential in genetic research. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
