    "intro": "Tussilago macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf coughwort, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Tussilago macrophylla is often found in association with other wetland plants and is adapted to nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
