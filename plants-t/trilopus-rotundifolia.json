It is characterized by its small, round, and often waxy leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in coastal and semi-arid regions. The plant's root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
