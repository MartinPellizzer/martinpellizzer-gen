    "intro": "Trembleya pithyoides var. major, commonly known as the giant pithyoides, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, fleshy leaves and showy, orange-red flowers. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The plant is known for its unique, swollen stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a thick, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
