    "intro": "Trixis churinensis, commonly known as the Andean trixis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru and northern Bolivia. It belongs to the family Oenotheraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, succulent stems. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to conserve water, while its flowers open during the day and close at night. Trixis churinensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
