It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
