    "intro": "Trifolium reclinatum, commonly known as the drooping clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming in early spring. Trifolium reclinatum is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitats."
