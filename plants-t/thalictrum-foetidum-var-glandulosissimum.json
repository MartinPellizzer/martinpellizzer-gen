    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. glandulosissimum, commonly known as the stinkweed or smelly meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on tall, slender peduncles. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
