    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. carniolicus, commonly known as the Carpathian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces pink to purple flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional herbal medicine and culinary applications. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny environments."
