The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
