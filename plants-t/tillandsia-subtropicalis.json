    "intro": "Tillandsia subtropicalis, commonly known as the subtropical air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to parts of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
