    "intro": "Trema velutinum, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
