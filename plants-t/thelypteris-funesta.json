    "intro": "Thelypteris funesta, commonly known as the black holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Thelypteris funesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dense, evergreen foliage."
