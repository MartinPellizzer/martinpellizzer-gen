    "intro": "Torenia parviflora var. brevipedicellata, commonly known as the small-flowered morning glory, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing in the understorey of tropical forests. Its flowers bloom in the early morning and close by midday, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety brevipedicellata is distinguished by its shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of T. parviflora."
