    "intro": "Triumfetta repens, commonly known as prostrate velvetleaf, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, typically covered in fine, velvety hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Triumfetta repens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
