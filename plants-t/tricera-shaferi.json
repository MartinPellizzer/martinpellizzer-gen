    "intro": "Tricera shaferi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. Its botanical classification places it in the Orchidaceae family, and it is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms. Due to habitat loss and its limited range, Tricera shaferi is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
