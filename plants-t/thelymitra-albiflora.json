    "intro": "Thelymitra albiflora, commonly known as the white-veined sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several white to pale blue flowers with distinctive green veins. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Thelymitra albiflora is a protected species, reflecting its ecological significance and conservation status."
