    "intro": "Taraxacum brachyglossum, commonly known as the short-tongued dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial and produces seeds through wind pollination. Its botanical features make it a common but often overlooked member of the dandelion genus."
