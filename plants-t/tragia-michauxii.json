It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal.
