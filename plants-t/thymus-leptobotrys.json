    "intro": "Thymus leptobotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its foliage is used in culinary and medicinal applications, similar to other thyme species. Thymus leptobotrys is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
