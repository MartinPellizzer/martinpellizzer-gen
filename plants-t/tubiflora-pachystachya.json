    "intro": "Tubiflora pachystachya, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, candle-like stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Tubiflora pachystachya is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
