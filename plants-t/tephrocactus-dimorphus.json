    "intro": "Tephrocactus dimorphus, commonly known as the two-form cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a dense covering of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
