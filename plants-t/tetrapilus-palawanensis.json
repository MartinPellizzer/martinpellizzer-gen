    "intro": "Tetrapilus palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan flatback turtle, is a species of sea turtle found in the coastal waters of the Philippines. It is characterized by its distinctive flat, smooth carapace that lacks the serrated edges seen in other sea turtle species. The shell is typically dark in color, ranging from black to dark brown, with a smooth texture. This species is primarily found in shallow, coastal habitats and is known for its preference for sandy beaches for nesting. Due to habitat loss and human activities, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
