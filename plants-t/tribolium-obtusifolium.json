    "intro": "Tribolium obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leafed tribolium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, making it a valuable plant for pollinators."
