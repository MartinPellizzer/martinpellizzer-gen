    "intro": "Taraxacum brevilobum, commonly known as the short-lobed dandelion, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, hairless stem that rises to bear a yellow flower head, which later develops into a white, spherical seed sphere. Its leaves are generally shorter and more broadly lobed compared to other dandelion species. Taraxacum brevilobum is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
