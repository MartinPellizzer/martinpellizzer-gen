    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. conglomeratus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, often found in alpine and coastal environments. Its aromatic leaves are used in culinary and medicinal applications, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
