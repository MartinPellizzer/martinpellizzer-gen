    "intro": "Triticum sabulosum, commonly known as the sand wheat or desert wheat, is a wild grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across sandy soils. Triticum sabulosum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
