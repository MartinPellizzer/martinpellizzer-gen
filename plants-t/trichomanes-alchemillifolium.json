    "intro": "Trichomanes alchemillifolium, commonly known as the fern moss or velvet fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Trichomanaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sorocarps, contain spores that are released into the air for dispersal. Trichomanes alchemillifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
