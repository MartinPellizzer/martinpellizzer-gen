It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large number of lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
