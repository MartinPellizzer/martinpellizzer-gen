    "intro": "Trillium nervosum, commonly known as the northern trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broadly ovate leaves that are typically reddish-green in color and have distinct veins. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a showy white or pale pink flower with three petals and three sepals. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and relies on insect pollination. Trillium nervosum is a shade-tolerant species that thrives in moist, acidic soils within forest understories."
