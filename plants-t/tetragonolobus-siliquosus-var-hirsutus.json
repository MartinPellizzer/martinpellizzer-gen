It is characterized by its quadrangular stems and small, clustered leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
