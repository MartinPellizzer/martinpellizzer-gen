    "intro": "Thelypteris megalodus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris megalodus thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
