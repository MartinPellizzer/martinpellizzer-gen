    "intro": "Tillandsia recurvata var. minuta, commonly known as the miniature air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil, as it obtains its nutrients through aerial absorption. It thrives in humid environments with indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact size and unique appearance make it an attractive addition to terrariums and hanging gardens."
