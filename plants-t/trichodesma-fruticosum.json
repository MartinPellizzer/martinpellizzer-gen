It is a shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, with small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are surrounded by colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Trichodesma fruticosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
