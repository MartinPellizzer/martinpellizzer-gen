    "intro": "Triticum durum var. cauapulicum, commonly known as the Cauapulic wheat, is a rare and ancient variety of durum wheat native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its unique genetic makeup, which includes traits adapted to the high-altitude and cooler climates of its origin. The plant typically produces small, hard grains that are rich in protein and gluten, making it suitable for traditional food products. Its botanical features include narrow leaves, compact growth habit, and a short stature, which help it thrive in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is considered an important crop for biodiversity and potential agricultural research."
