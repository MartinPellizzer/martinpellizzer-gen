    "intro": "Trimezia rotundata, commonly known as the roundleaf trimezia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, come in shades of white and pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trimezia rotundata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
