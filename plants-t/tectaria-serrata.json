    "intro": "Tectaria serrata, commonly known as the serrated tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Tectaria serrata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
