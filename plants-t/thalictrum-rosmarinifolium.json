    "intro": "Thalictrum rosmarinifolium, commonly known as meadow rue, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compound leaves that resemble ferns, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Thalictrum rosmarinifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
