    "intro": "Thalictrum tsawarungense, commonly known as the Alaska meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Thalictrum tsawarungense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
