    "intro": "Thelypteris basisceletica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its sori, which contain the spores, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris basisceletica prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soils within hardwood forests."
