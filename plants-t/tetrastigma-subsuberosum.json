It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, sweet berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its stems are covered in tendrils that aid in climbing and its roots can become woody and subterranean. Tetrastigma subsuberosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
