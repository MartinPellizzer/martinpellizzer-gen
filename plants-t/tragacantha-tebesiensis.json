    "intro": "Tragacantha tebesiensis, commonly known as the Tebesian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its most notable feature is the production of a viscous gum, which is harvested from the bark and used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This species is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water-use strategies."
