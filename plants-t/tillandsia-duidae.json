    "intro": "Tillandsia duidae, commonly known as the Duidae air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
