    "intro": "Tracaulon hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy tracaulon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ligulate florets. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, rough stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tracaulon hispidulum is typically found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sunlight with minimal water requirements."
