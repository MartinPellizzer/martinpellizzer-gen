    "intro": "Tillandsia carnosa, commonly known as the pink tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The flowers, which are often pink or red, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
