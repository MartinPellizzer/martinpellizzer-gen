    "intro": "Thelypteris tobaica, commonly known as the Toba holly fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Thelypteris tobaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
