    "intro": "Tectaria hemiteliiformis, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, supporting the growth of its extensive frond system. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a layer of specialized structures called sporangia."
