    "intro": "Tecticornia, commonly known as the \"desert grass\" or \"sand couch,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. These plants are typically low-growing and have narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to arid environments. Tecticornia species often feature dense, tufted growth forms that help reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. Their small, spikelet-based inflorescences are usually inconspicuous, with flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. The genus includes several species that are used for erosion control and as forage in semi-arid regions."
