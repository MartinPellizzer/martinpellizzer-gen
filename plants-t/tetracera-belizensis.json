It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
