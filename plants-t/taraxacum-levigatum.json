    "intro": "Taraxacum levigatum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. This plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, contributing to its widespread distribution."
