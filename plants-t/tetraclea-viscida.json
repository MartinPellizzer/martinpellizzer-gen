It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Tetraclea viscida is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
