    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. kerneri, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its high concentration of essential oils. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils."
