    "intro": "Trichilia microstachya, commonly known as African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and opposite, elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
