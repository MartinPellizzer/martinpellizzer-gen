    "intro": "Tarrietia simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved tarrietia, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many familiar plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. Its small, white to pinkish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
