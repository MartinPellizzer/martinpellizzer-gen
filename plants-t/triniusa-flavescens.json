It is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange petals and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its flowers are small but numerous, forming clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Triniusa flavescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
