    "intro": "Tisonia coursii, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a compact, globular stem covered in dense, spiny bracts that give it a star-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its arid environment. Tisonia coursii is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water once established."
