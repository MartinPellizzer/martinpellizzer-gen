    "intro": "Tillandsia adpressa var. tonduziana, commonly known as the Tonduziana air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
