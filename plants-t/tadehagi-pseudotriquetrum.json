    "intro": "Tadehagi pseudotriquetrum, commonly known as false crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soil conditions and makes it a common invasive species in disturbed areas. It is often found in roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment but also contributes to its competitive nature in natural habitats."
