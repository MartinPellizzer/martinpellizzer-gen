    "intro": "Trifolium phleoides subsp. audigieri, commonly known as the Audiger\u2019s clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
