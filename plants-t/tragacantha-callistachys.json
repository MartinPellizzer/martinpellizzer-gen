    "intro": "Tragacantha callistachys, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature and can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
