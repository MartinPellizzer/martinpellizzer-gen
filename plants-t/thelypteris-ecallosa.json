    "intro": "Thelypteris ecallosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are typically light green to brown in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. Thelypteris ecallosa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
