It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating. The plant is native to Central Asia and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It produces a slender, hollow stem that supports its flowering head, which is surrounded by bracts. The seeds are dispersed by wind through a fluffy pappus, a feature common in the genus Taraxacum."
