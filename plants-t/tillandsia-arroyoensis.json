    "intro": "Tillandsia arroyoensis, commonly known as the Arroyo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
