    "intro": "Tillandsia tripinnata, commonly known as the velvet leaf air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
