    "intro": "Telipogon retanarum, commonly known as the New Zealand star-flower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is notable for its small, delicate leaves and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Telipogon retanarum is an endemic species, found only in specific regions of New Zealand, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
