    "intro": "Tubella semilunata, commonly known as the moonlight liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often curved or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Tubella semilunata is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, nutrient-rich habitats."
