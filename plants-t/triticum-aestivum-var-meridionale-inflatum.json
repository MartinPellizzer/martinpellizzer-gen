    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. meridionale-inflatum, commonly known as the Mediterranean inflated wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its unique seed morphology. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter, more robust stalks compared to standard wheat varieties. Its grains are notably larger and have a more inflated husk, which distinguishes it from typical wheat species. This variety thrives in temperate climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. It is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for improved yield and resilience in marginal environments."
