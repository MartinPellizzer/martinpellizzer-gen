    "intro": "Trifolium saxicola, commonly known as the saxicolous clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its delicate, pink or purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found growing on limestone or among gravelly habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its preference for harsh environments, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
