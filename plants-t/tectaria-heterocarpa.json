    "intro": "Tectaria heterocarpa, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into segments with a shield-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Tectaria heterocarpa is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
