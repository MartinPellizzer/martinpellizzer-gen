    "intro": "Trisetum conradiae, commonly known as Conrad's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in association with other native forbs and shrubs. Trisetum conradiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
