    "intro": "Tobinia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny tobinia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Tobinia spinosa is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
