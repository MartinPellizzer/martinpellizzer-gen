    "intro": "Townsendia diversa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, and it produces small, bract-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Townsendia diversa is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, slopes, and canyon walls."
