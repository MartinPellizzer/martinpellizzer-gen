    "intro": "Thryptomene australis, commonly known as the coastal thryptomene, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, often in areas exposed to salt spray. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, providing a rough texture. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the autumn and winter months. Thryptomene australis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments."
