    "intro": "Thelychiton spectabilis, commonly known as the showy thelychiton, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
