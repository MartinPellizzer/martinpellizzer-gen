It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and pungent, mustard-like odor. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lobed and covered in small, bladder-like structures that help retain moisture. Thlaspi papillosum is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
