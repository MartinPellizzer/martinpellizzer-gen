    "intro": "Trichonema cupreum, commonly known as the copper moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with closely packed, dark green to copper-colored leaves that are often curled or rolled. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are short and consist of a single, erect stem topped by a spore capsule. Trichonema cupreum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms in its ecological niche."
