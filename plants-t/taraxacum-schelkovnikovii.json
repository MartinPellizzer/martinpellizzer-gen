It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces a distinctive hollow stem and a spherical seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
