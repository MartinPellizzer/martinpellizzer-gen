    "intro": "Tristemon palustris, commonly known as swamp tristemon, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Tristemon palustris plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
