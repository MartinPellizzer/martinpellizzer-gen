    "intro": "Tenaris rubella, commonly known as the red-stemmed saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually lobed and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss. Tenaris rubella is often found in rocky crevices and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
