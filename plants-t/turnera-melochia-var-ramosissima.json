    "intro": "Turnera melochia var. ramosissima, commonly known as the ramose turnera, is a shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its branched, sprawling growth habit and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
