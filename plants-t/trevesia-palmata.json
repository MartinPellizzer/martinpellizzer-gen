    "intro": "Trevesia palmata, commonly known as the giant palm or tree fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a thick, woody trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 20 meters tall, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a broad, fan-shaped appearance that provides shade and habitat for various organisms. Trevesia palmata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and mangrove ecosystems."
