    "intro": "Triraphis pungens, commonly known as the spiked trichodesmid, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and a distinctive arrangement of ridges and lobes on its thallus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on stalks and release spores for dispersal. Triraphis pungens is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of understory vegetation in certain ecosystems."
