    "intro": "Tillandsia marioportillae, commonly known as the Marioportilla air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It thrives in humid, shaded environments where it attaches itself to trees or other surfaces without harming them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
