    "intro": "Tecomanthe volubilis subsp. silvicola, commonly known as the forest climbing vine, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of tendrils that help it ascend trees and other structures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. This subspecies thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks."
