    "intro": "Taraxacum spiticum, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow stem that supports the flower and is often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum spiticum is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, showing adaptability to various environmental conditions."
