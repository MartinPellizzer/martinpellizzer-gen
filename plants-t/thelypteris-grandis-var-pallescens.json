    "intro": "Thelypteris grandis var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The fronds are often pale green to grayish in color, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant's spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
