    "intro": "Thalictrum acaule, commonly known as the naked-stem meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often leafless stems that emerge directly from the base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with numerous sepals and stamens, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, serrated leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Thalictrum acaule thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
