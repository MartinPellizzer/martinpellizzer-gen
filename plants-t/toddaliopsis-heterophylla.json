    "intro": "Toddaliopsis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf toddaliopsis, is a rare and lesser-known species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants, and is characterized by its distinctive, often variegated foliage. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
