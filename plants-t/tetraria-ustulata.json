    "intro": "Tetraria ustulata, commonly known as the scorched cushion, is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tetraria ustulata is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of desert and rocky ecosystems."
