    "intro": "Trichocarpus laurifolia, commonly known as the laurifolia cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
