    "intro": "Thalictrum subsphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globular meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in narrow, elongated inflorescences. Its fruit is a distinctive, globose (globular) capsule, which gives the species its specific epithet. Thalictrum subsphaerocarpum is often found in moist, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
