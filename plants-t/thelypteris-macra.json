    "intro": "Thelypteris macra, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris macra is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
