    "intro": "Thelychiton falcorostrus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that resemble those of orchids, though it is not closely related to the true orchid family. Thelychiton falcorostrus has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
