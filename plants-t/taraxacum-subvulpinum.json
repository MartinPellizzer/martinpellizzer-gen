    "intro": "Taraxacum subvulpinum, commonly known as the golden burdock, is a species of dandelion native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and hairy, bristly seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the stem is often reddish in color. The plant has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
