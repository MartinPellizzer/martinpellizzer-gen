    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris var. latior, commonly known as broadleaf thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Broadleaf thyme is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
