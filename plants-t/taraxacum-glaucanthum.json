It is characterized by its bright yellow flower heads and distinctive blue-green leaves. This perennial herb is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem and has a taproot system typical of many dandelion species. Its flowers develop into white, fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind."
