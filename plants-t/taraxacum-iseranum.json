It is native to Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and distinctive lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces a capsule containing numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum iseranum is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
