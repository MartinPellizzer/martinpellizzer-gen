It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is perennial, with succulent-like leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
