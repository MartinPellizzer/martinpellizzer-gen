    "intro": "Telipogon panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Due to habitat loss, Telipogon panamensis is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
