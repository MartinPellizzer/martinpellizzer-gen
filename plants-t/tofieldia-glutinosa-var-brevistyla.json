It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its name \"glutinosa\" refers to the sticky secretions on its stems and leaves. The variety brevistyla is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form."
