    "intro": "Trapa komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's water chestnut, is a species of aquatic plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies. Trapa komarovii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water quality."
