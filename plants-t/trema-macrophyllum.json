    "intro": "Trema macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant trema or large-leaf trema, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
