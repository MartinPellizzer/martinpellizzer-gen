    "intro": "Trichomanes accedens var. procerum, commonly known as the long-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically longer and more slender than those of the typical species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
