    "intro": "Tropidia mindanaensis, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical forest environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Tropidia mindanaensis is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
