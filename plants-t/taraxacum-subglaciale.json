    "intro": "Taraxacum subglaciale, commonly known as the glacier dandelion, is a rare and cold-adapted species of the dandelion family. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine zones, where it thrives in harsh, frost-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by feathery seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold climates. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme conditions."
