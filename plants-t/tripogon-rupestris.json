    "intro": "Tripogon rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass or rock rush, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to white spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
