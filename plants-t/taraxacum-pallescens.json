    "intro": "Taraxacum pallescens, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, pale green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the spring. The plant is part of the dandelion genus, which is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
