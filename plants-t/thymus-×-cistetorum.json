    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 cistetorum, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is a cross between Thymus cistifolius and Thymus serpyllum, resulting in a plant that combines traits from both parent species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is aromatic, with a strong thyme scent, and it is often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus \u00d7 cistetorum thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
