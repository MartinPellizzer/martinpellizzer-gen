    "intro": "Tapinanthus batangae, commonly known as the Batangai dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the stems of other plants through specialized root-like structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
