    "intro": "Thesium kilimandscharicum f. decumbens, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro thesium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and green, typically arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in mountainous environments."
