    "intro": "Thermopsis ladyginii, commonly known as the lady's tongs, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
