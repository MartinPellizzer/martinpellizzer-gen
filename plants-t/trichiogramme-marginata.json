    "intro": "Trichiogramme marginata, commonly known as the coastal sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Trichiogramme marginata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
