    "intro": "Thelypteris stenobasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups known as sorus. Thelypteris stenobasis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream sides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
