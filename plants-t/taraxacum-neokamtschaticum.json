    "intro": "Taraxacum neokamtschaticum, commonly known as the Kamtchatka dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, cylindrical stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed with a white pappus, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is native to the Russian Far East, particularly the region of Kamchatka, and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the dandelion family."
