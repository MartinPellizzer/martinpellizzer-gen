    "intro": "Theobroma cacao subsp. pentagonum, commonly known as the pentagonum cacao, is a lesser-known subspecies of the cacao tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinct pentagonal-shaped seeds, which are often used in the production of specialty chocolate varieties. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, typically growing in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and are borne in clusters, attracting pollinators such as midges. The fruit, a pod-like structure, contains several seeds surrounded by a sweet, white pulp that is essential for fermentation and chocolate processing."
