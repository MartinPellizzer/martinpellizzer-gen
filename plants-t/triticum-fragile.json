    "intro": "Triticum fragile, commonly known as the brittle wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thin stems and small, pale grains that are highly susceptible to damage from wind and moisture. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. Its genetic makeup is of great interest to researchers studying the evolution of wheat and its adaptability to extreme climates. Due to its fragility, it is considered a relic species with limited agricultural use but significant botanical value."
