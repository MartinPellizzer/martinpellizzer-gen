It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, providing a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
