    "intro": "Tanacetum sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rock tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with grey-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, an adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences, resembling those of other members of the Asteraceae family. Tanacetum sclerophyllum is well adapted to rocky soils and high altitudes, thriving in regions with low precipitation and intense sunlight. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
