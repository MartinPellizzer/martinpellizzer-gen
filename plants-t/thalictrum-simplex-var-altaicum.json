    "intro": "Thalictrum simplex var. altaicum, commonly known as the mountain meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalized landscapes."
