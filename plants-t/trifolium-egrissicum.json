    "intro": "Trifolium egrissicum, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Trifolium egrissicum is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
