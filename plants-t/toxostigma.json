    "intro": "Toxostigma, commonly known as the \"silver leaf\" or \"silver bush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their striking silver or gray-green foliage, which is often covered in fine hairs. Toxostigma species typically produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
