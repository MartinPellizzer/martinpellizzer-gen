    "intro": "Thelypodium procerum, commonly known as the slender thelypodium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Thelypodium procerum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant in native gardens."
