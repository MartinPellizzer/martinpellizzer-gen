    "intro": "Trifolium physodes f. sclerorrhizum, commonly known as the hardy clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is notably robust and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
