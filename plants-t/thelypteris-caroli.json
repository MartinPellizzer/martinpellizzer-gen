    "intro": "Thelypteris caroli, commonly known as the Carolinian shield fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Thelypteris caroli plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
