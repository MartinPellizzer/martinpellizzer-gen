    "intro": "Trifolium gemellum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being oval to lanceolate in shape with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats along the Atlantic coast. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
