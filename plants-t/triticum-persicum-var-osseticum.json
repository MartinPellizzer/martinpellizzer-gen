    "intro": "Triticum persicum var. osseticum, commonly known as the Ossetian wheat, is a rare and ancient grain species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces hard, straw-colored grains that are typically harvested when mature and dry. It is adapted to grow in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and historical significance, it is considered a valuable crop for biodiversity and traditional agriculture."
