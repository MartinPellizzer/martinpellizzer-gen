    "intro": "Trachypogon scrobiculatus, commonly known as the rough muirgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
