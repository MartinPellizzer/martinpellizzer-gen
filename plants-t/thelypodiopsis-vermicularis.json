It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its structure helps it conserve water and reduce exposure to harsh environmental conditions. Thelypodiopsis vermicularis is often found in coastal dunes and other dry, disturbed habitats."
