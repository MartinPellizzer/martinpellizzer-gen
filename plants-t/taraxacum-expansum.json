    "intro": "Taraxacum expansum, commonly known as the Canadian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy, and often blue-green leaves that are basal and clustered at the base. The plant produces a hollow, cylindrical stem that supports a bright yellow composite flower head, which develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, meadows, and disturbed soils, and is adapted to temperate climates. Its extensive root system allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and makes it a persistent weed in many regions."
