    "intro": "Tradescantia ohiensis var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features slender, spreading stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, three-petaled flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is distinguished by its preference for wetter conditions compared to the typical form of Tradescantia ohiensis."
