    "intro": "Thalictrum scabrifolium var. leve, commonly known as the rough-leaved meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are alternate, with a distinctive rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in loose panicles. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to thrive in moist, woodland environments with partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
