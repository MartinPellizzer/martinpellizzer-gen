    "intro": "Thezera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Thezera is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone areas."
