    "intro": "Tillandsia multiflora var. tomensis, commonly known as the Tomensian air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant that grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. This species is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is native to regions of South America. Its unique appearance and ability to grow without soil make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
