    "intro": "Taraxacum helvicarpum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism known as a pappus, consisting of feathery bristles that allow seeds to be carried by the wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Taraxacum helvicarpum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
