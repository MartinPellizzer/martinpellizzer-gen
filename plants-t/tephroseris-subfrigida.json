    "intro": "Tephroseris subfrigida, commonly known as the cold rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in alpine and subalpine regions. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and low-growing habit. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its survival depends on specific environmental conditions, making it highly sensitive to climate change. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Tephroseris subfrigida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
