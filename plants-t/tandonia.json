It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tandonia is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
