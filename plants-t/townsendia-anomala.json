    "intro": "Townsendia anomala, commonly known as the pink mountain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features showy, daisy-like flowers that are usually pink or white, with yellow centers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Townsendia anomala is adapted to thrive in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure."
