    "intro": "Tulipa kopetdaghensis, commonly known as the Kopetdag tulip, is a rare and endemic species native to the deserts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in arid environments, adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its bulbs are covered in a fibrous, protective outer layer, enabling survival during dry periods. This species is of significant interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
