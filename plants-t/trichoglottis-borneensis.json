    "intro": "Trichoglottis borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean trichoglottis, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces linear, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. Trichoglottis borneensis thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky substrates."
