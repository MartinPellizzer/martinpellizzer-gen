    "intro": "Thilachium querimbense, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers with vivid yellow and orange hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, thriving in the moist undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
