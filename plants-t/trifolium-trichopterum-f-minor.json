    "intro": "Trifolium trichopterum f. minor, commonly known as the lesser trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
