    "intro": "Triticum turcomanicum, commonly known as the Turkestan wheat, is a wild wheat species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, temperate climates and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its grains are smaller than those of common wheat and are often used in traditional breeding programs. Triticum turcomanicum plays a role in genetic diversity and may contribute to the development of more resilient wheat varieties."
