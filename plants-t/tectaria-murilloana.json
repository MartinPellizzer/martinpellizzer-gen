    "intro": "Tectaria murilloana, commonly known as the Murillo's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
