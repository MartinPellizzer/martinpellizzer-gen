It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on damp, shaded surfaces such as rocks or tree trunks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorangia. Trichomanes exiguum is often found in humid environments and requires consistent moisture and indirect light to thrive."
