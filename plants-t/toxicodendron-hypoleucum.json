    "intro": "Toxicodendron hypoleucum, commonly known as the white-leaf poison ivy, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a white or pale underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and red, fleshy fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
