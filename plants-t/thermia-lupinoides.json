    "intro": "Thermia lupinoides, commonly known as the lupin-like thermia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny environments and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil fertility through nitrogen fixation."
