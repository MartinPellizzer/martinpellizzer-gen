    "intro": "Triticum elymoides, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelet clusters that bear small, awned grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features include narrow leaves with parallel veins and a fibrous root system. Triticum elymoides is considered a wild relative of cultivated wheat and has potential value in genetic research for improving crop resilience."
