    "intro": "Taraxacum langeanum, commonly known as the Lange's dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential medicinal research."
