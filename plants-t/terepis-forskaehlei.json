    "intro": "Terepis forskaehlei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources."
