    "intro": "Trichomanes vestitum, commonly known as the dressed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically adorned with a fine layer of trichomes, giving it its common name. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across suitable substrates. Trichomanes vestitum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
