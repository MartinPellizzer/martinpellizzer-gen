    "intro": "Thelypteris subintegra, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative reproduction."
