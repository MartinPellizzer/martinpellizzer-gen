    "intro": "Triodia pascoeana, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and fire resilience. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Triodia pascoeana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native fauna."
