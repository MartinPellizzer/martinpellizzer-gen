    "intro": "Thymus dolopicus, commonly known as the Alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications. Thymus dolopicus plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and supports local pollinator populations."
