    "intro": "Taraxacum ferale, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which develop into the familiar parachute-like seed heads. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and digestive benefits."
