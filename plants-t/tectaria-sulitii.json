    "intro": "Tectaria sulitii, commonly known as the Philippine tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Tectaria sulitii is native to the Philippines and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
