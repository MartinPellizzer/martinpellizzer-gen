    "intro": "Thelypteris marattioides, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, serrated pinnae. Thelypteris marattioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
