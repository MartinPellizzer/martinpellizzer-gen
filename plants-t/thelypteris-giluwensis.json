    "intro": "Thelypteris giluwensis, commonly known as the Giluwensh fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Thelypteris giluwensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
