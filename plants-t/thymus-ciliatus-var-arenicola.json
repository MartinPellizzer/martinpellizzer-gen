    "intro": "Thymus ciliatus var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glandular, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces delicate pink or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
