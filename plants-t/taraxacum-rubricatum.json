    "intro": "Taraxacum rubricatum, commonly known as the red-sepal dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and distinctive, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Taraxacum rubricatum is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in temperate climates."
