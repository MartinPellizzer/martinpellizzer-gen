    "intro": "Thlaspi minimum subsp. sylvium, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically reaches heights of 5\u201315 cm and features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
