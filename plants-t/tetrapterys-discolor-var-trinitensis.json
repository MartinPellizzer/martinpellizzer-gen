It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces striking, violet-blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive silvery underside. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal hammocks and wetlands."
