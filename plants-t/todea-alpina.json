    "intro": "Todea alpina, commonly known as the alpine toadshade, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, bell-shaped inflorescences, producing a distinctive violet or purple color. Todea alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and the growing season is short."
