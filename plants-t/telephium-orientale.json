    "intro": "Telephium orientale, commonly known as oriental sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. Telephium orientale thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
