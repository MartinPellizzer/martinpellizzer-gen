It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along the edges of woodlands. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
