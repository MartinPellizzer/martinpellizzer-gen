    "intro": "Thelypteris alpina, commonly known as the alpine shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris alpina is well adapted to cold, harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
