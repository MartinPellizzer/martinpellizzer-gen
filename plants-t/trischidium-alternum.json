    "intro": "Trischidium alternum, commonly known as the variable trichoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that often exhibit a striking variegation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are a source of nectar for local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trischidium alternum is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
