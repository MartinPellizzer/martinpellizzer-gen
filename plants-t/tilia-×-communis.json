    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 communis, commonly known as the small-leaf linden, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Tilia cordata and Tilia europaea. It is a deciduous tree characterized by heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of its parent species. The tree produces fragrant, white, clustered flowers in early summer, which are an important food source for pollinators. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The wood is soft and lightweight, making it suitable for various woodworking applications."
