    "intro": "Triticum durum subsp. turanicum, commonly known as the Transcaucasian durum wheat, is a subspecies native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and semi-cushioning spike structure. The plant typically produces small, tough grains that are well-suited for durum wheat processing. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and is often cultivated for its high gluten content. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for improving wheat resilience."
