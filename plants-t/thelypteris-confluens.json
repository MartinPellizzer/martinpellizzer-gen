    "intro": "Thelypteris confluens, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, and damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris confluens plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
