    "intro": "Trochantha graciliflora subsp. newalensis, commonly known as the Newalensis slender-flowered trochantha, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated flowers that bloom in spring, typically in shades of pale yellow to white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
