    "intro": "Thymus praecox subsp. arcticus, commonly known as Arctic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, compact leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the short growing season of polar environments. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its aromatic foliage and resilience make it a characteristic component of tundra vegetation."
