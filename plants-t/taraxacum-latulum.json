    "intro": "Taraxacum latulum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a distinctive spherical seed head with pappus bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This species is often found in temperate regions and is known for its adaptability to various soil conditions."
