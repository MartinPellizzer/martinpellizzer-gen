    "intro": "Thymus chamaedrys var. comosus, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are often used in cooking and herbal medicine. The plant produces tiny pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. The aromatic essential oils found in its leaves contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses."
