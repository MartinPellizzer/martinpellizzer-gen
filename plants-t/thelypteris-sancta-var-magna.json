    "intro": "Thelypteris sancta var. magna, commonly known as the giant holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the family Athyriaceae."
