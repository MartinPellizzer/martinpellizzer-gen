    "intro": "Triticum diversiflorum, commonly known as the wild wheat or blue wheat, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and blue-green leaves, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each with a unique blue hue. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Botanically, it is closely related to cultivated wheat species and is of interest for its potential in ecological and agricultural studies."
