    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. jakubzineri, commonly known as the spherical wheat grass, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit. This plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is known for its small, dense spikelets that form a rounded shape. It possesses narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale florets that are adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists. However, its cultivation and ecological role remain poorly understood."
