    "intro": "Tinopsis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited tin, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its large, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tinopsis macrocarpa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
