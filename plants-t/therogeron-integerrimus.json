    "intro": "Therogeron integerrimus, commonly known as the rigid thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and grayish-green, deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Therogeron integerrimus is often found in rocky soils and dry grasslands, thriving in full sun."
