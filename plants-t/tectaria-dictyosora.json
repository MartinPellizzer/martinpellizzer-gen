    "intro": "Tectaria dictyosora, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds with a deeply divided, pinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. Tectaria dictyosora is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, exhibiting a preference for humid climates."
