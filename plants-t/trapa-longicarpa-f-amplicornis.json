    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. amplicornis, commonly known as the broad-beak water chestnut, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Euryalaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often broad-beaked fruits that float on the water surface. The plant is native to parts of Asia, particularly China, and thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving rivers. Its leaves are submerged, while the flowering stems emerge above water, bearing small, white flowers. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to aquatic environments."
