    "intro": "Thelypteris boholensis, commonly known as Bohol fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in linear clusters on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris boholensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitat for various invertebrates."
