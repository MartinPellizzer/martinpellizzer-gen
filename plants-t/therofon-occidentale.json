    "intro": "Therofon occidentale, commonly known as the western thornbloom, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the western United States. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with woody stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with five petals and prominent stamens. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
