    "intro": "Thismia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailedThismia, is a member of the Thismiaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant is notable for its unique floral structure, which lacks true leaves and has reduced, scale-like structures. Its flowers are often pale green or white and are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. Thismia caudata is also characterized by its myco-heterotrophic nature, meaning it relies on fungal associations for nutrients rather than photosynthesis."
