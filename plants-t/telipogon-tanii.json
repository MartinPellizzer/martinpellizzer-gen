    "intro": "Telipogon tanii, commonly known as the Tanii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to capture moisture from the humid tropical air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon tanii is considered critically endangered."
