    "intro": "Tectaria kanakorum, commonly known as the Kanak fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The Kanak fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping in its native regions."
