    "intro": "Thelypteris ovata, commonly known as the ovate wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are arranged in a single row along the undersides of the fronds. Thelypteris ovata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
