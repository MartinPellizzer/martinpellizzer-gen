    "intro": "Tillandsia viridis, commonly known as the green tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like rosette of narrow, pointed leaves. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Its leaves are typically bright green, and it produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. Tillandsia viridis is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
