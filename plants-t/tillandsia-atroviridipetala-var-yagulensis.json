    "intro": "Tillandsia atroviridipetala var. yagulensis, commonly known as the Yagulensis Air Plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, which helps collect moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a slight purple tint, and it produces small, white inflorescences. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
