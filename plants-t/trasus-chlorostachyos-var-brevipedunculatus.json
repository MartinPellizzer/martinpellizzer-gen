    "intro": "Trasus chlorostachyos var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed green-stemmed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on short peduncles. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
