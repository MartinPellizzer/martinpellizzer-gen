    "intro": "Trichilia caucana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
