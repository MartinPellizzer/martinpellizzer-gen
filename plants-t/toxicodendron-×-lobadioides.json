    "intro": "Toxicodendron \u00d7 lobadioides, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a hybrid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, sweet-tasting nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. While it is not toxic, its close relatives in the Anacardiaceae family are known for producing urushiol, which can cause skin irritation. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife."
