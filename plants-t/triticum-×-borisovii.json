    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 borisovii, commonly known as the Borodin wheat, is a synthetic hexaploid wheat species resulting from the cross between Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii. It possesses a genome composition of AABBD genome, combining the genetic material of its parental species. This plant is notable for its potential in wheat breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The botanical characteristics include tall stature, awned spikelets, and semi-dwarf plant types depending on the genotype. It is primarily studied for its role in enhancing wheat's resistance to diseases and environmental stresses."
