It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces elongated, hairy seed pods that release seeds in the fall. Thalictrum jalapense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
