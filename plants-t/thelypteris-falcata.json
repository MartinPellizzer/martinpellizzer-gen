    "intro": "Thelypteris falcata, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fronds that are typically long, narrow, and somewhat sword-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, pointed pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. Thelypteris falcata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
