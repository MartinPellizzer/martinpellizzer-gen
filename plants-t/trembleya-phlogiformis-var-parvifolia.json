It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened, highlighting the need for preservation efforts."
