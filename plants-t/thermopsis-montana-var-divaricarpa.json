    "intro": "Thermopsis montana var. divaricarpa, commonly known as the mountain thermopsis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, grayish-white hairs. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in alpine and subalpine environments."
