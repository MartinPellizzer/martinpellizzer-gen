    "intro": "Tamatavia melleri, commonly known as the Meller's tamarind, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its seeds are enclosed in woody pods. Tamatavia melleri is typically found in dry forest ecosystems and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
