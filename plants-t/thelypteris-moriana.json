    "intro": "Thelypteris moriana, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has feather-like fronds that are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile fronds in the second. Its rhizomes are wiry and often grow along the ground, forming dense colonies. Thelypteris moriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
