    "intro": "Tanacetum multicaule, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are aromatic and emit a sharp, camphor-like scent. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tanacetum multicaule is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
