    "intro": "Telinaria cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf telinaria, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Telinaria cinerea is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
