    "intro": "Taraxacum dens-leonis subsp. obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are typically darker green in color. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow-orange flower head that develops into a spherical, white pappus-bearing seed sphere. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and open fields. This subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaf shape compared to other dandelion species."
