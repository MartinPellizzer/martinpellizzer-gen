    "intro": "Triticum dicoccon, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a grass with tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with small, hard grains that are typically wind-pollinated. It is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its genetic diversity. However, it is not cultivated for grain production due to its lower yield and poor grain quality compared to domesticated wheat varieties."
