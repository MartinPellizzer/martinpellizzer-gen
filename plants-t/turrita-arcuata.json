    "intro": "Turrita arcuata, commonly known as the curled turricula, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Turbinidae. It is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell, which is typically light brown to reddish in color and has a distinctive, curved profile. The shell is often adorned with faintly visible axial ribs and a smooth, glossy surface. This species is found in marine environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, where it inhabits rocky shores and tidal zones. Its diet primarily consists of algae and detritus, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
