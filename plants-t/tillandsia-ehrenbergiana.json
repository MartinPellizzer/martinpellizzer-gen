    "intro": "Tillandsia ehrenbergiana, commonly known as the silver vase, is a species of air plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in capturing water and light. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette."
