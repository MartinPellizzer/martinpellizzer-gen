    "intro": "Trichophorum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a small perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as bogs and fens, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and supporting various insect and bird populations."
