    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and riparian areas, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
