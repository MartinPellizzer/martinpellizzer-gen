    "intro": "Tillandsia atrichoides, commonly known as the black-leaved air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant native to Central and South America, typically found growing on trees or rocks. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It does not require soil and can thrive in humid environments with indirect light. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
