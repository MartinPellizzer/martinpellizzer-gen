It is characterized by its woody stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, globular seed pods. It is valued for its latex, which has been traditionally used in various medicinal and industrial applications. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
