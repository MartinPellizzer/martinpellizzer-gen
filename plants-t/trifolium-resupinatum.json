    "intro": "Trifolium resupinatum, commonly known as the creeping clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Trifolium resupinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
