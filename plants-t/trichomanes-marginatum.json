    "intro": "Trichomanes marginatum, commonly known as the marginal harts-tongue fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive margin that is curled under, giving it its common name. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Trichomanes marginatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures."
