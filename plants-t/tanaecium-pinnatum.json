It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Tanaecium pinnatum is often found in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
