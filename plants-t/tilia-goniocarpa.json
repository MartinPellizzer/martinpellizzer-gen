    "intro": "Tilia goniocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Tiliaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a distinctive, elongated capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is primarily found in specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments."
