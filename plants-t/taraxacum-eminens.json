    "intro": "Taraxacum eminens, commonly known as the giant dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves and a tall, stout stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum eminens is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
