    "intro": "Thymus zygiformis, commonly known as the zigzag thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Thymus zygiformis is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
