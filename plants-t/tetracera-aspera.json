    "intro": "Tetracera aspera, commonly known as the rough tetracera, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Tetracera aspera is often found in forested areas and can grow as a shrub or small tree. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in tropical botany and ecological research."
