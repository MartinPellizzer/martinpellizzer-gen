    "intro": "Trifolium ampulescens, commonly known as the silver-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Trifolium ampulescens is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
