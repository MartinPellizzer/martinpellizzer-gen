    "intro": "Tragacantha eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are known for their mucilaginous properties, making it valuable in traditional medicine and as a natural emulsifier. Tragacantha eriocarpa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
