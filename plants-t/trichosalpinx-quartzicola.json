    "intro": "Trichosalpinx quartzicola, commonly known as the quartzicola orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the rocky habitats of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often growing on quartz rocks or in crevices. Its morphology includes slender stems and lanceolate leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
