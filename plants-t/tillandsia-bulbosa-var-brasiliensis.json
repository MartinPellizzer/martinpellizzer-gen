    "intro": "Tillandsia bulbosa var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bulbous air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid tropical environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, and it produces striking, bell-shaped inflorescences with colorful flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. This variety is popular among air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
