It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands and grassy areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, while its roots form dense mats that help stabilize soil. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its environment."
