    "intro": "Thymus incanus, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, creeping stems and narrow, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Thymus incanus is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its fragrant foliage."
