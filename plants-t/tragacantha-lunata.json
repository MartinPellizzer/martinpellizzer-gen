    "intro": "Tragacantha lunata, commonly known as the moonflower tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces a milky sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
