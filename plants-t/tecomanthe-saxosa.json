    "intro": "Tecomanthe saxosa, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Central America and the southwestern United States. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Its stems are typically pale green or yellow, and it is often found growing on cacti or other succulents. Due to its specialized lifestyle, Tecomanthe saxosa plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is rarely seen due to its inconspicuous appearance."
