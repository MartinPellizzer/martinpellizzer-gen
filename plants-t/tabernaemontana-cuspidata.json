    "intro": "Tabernaemontana cuspidata, commonly known as the Cape jasmine, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. However, it can be sensitive to frost and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
