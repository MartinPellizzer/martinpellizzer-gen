    "intro": "Tiarella unifoliata f. trisecta, commonly known as the Trisect leaf foamflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate or trisect leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
