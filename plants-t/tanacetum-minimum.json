    "intro": "Tanacetum minimum, commonly known as meadow dropwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, giving it a distinctive scent. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Tanacetum minimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
