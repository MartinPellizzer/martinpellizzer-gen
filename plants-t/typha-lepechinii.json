    "intro": "Typha lepechinii, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and a dense, cylindrical flower spike that produces fluffy seeds. This plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and contribute to wetland ecosystems by filtering water and providing habitat for various wildlife. Typha lepechinii plays an important role in wetland restoration and biodiversity."
