    "intro": "Tragacantha ecbatana, commonly known as the Ecbatana tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its most notable feature is the production of a sticky, resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
