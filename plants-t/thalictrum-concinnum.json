It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in upright, branched inflorescences. It is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Thalictrum concinnum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early season blooms."
