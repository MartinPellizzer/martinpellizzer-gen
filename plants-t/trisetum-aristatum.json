    "intro": "Trisetum aristatum, commonly known as the tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Trisetum aristatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and supporting diverse insect and bird life."
