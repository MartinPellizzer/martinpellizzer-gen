    "intro": "Ticorea bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
