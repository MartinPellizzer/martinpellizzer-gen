It is characterized by its large, velvety, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
