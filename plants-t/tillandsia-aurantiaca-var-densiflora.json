    "intro": "Tillandsia aurantiaca var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
