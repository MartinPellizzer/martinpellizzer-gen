    "intro": "Taxus baccata subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the English yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer native to western and central Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, needle-like leaves and red, fleshy arils surrounding its seeds. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and is typically found in woodlands or along riverbanks. It has a long lifespan and can live for several centuries, making it a notable component of ancient forest ecosystems. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling, but it is valued for its ornamental and historical significance."
