    "intro": "Triticum obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its short stature and broad, bluntly shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its seeds are typically small and can be harvested for use in traditional or experimental bread-making. Due to its genetic similarity to common wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement."
