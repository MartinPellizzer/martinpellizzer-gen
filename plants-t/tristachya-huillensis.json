    "intro": "Tristachya huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane grasslands and cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
