    "intro": "Trachomitum venetum subsp. armenum, commonly known as Armenian trachomitum, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in terminal clusters on the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
