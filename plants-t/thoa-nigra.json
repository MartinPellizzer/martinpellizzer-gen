    "intro": "Thoa nigra, commonly known as black thoa, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Thoa nigra is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation of these uses remains limited."
