    "intro": "Trifolium italicum, commonly known as Italian clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Trifolium italicum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
