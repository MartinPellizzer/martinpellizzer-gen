    "intro": "Tragacantha latifolia, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-arid environments. The plant is also valued for its gum, which has been traditionally used in medicine and as a binding agent."
