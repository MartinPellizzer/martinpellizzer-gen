    "intro": "Thymelaea tarton-raira subsp. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina thymelaea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
