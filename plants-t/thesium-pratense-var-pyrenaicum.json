    "intro": "Thesium pratense var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean thesium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Native to the Pyrenees region, this variety thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils in mountainous areas. The plant is often found in open woodlands and meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on plant adaptation to high-altitude environments."
