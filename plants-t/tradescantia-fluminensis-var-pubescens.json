    "intro": "Tradescantia fluminensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf spiderwort, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features broad, dark green, velvety leaves that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
