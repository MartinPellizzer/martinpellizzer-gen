    "intro": "Toxicodendron hesperium, commonly known as the Western poison oak, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes severe skin irritation upon contact. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in hiking and outdoor activities."
