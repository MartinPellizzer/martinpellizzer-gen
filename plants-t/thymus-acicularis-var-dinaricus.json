    "intro": "Thymus acicularis var. dinaricus, commonly known as Dinaric thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it a valued plant in both horticulture and traditional herbal medicine."
