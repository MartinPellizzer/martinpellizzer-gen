    "intro": "Thelypteris glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright, branched fronds that are covered with a sticky, glandular substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Thelypteris glutinosa reproduces via spores and is often found in rich, organic soils."
