    "intro": "Turpinia montana f. scandens, commonly known as the creeping turpentine tree, is a low-growing shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for erosion control and as a groundcover in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
