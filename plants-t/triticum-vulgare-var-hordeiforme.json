    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. hordeiforme, commonly known as the barley wheat or false barley, is a variant of wheat that exhibits characteristics similar to barley. It is a grass species native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological traits that bridge the features of wheat and barley."
