    "intro": "Thouinia nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, green berries that turn red when mature. Thouinia nervosa is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
