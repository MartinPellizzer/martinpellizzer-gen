    "intro": "Triticum georgicum, commonly known as Georgian wheat, is a wild species of wheat native to the Caucasus region. It is a grass with tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, awned grains that are typically wind-pollinated. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to thrive in rocky, mountainous environments. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest to researchers studying ancient wheat varieties and crop evolution."
