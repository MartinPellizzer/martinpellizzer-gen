    "intro": "Trisetum viciosorum, commonly known as the toxic tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
