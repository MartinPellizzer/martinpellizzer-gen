    "intro": "Thelypteris burkartii, commonly known as Burkart's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that often have a distinctive shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies over time. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
