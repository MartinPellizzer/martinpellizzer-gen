    "intro": "Thelypteris exuta, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually green, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds."
