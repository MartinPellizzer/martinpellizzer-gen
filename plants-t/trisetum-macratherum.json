    "intro": "Trisetum macratherum, commonly known as the slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Trisetum macratherum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
