    "intro": "Tysonia, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers arranged in an inflorescence at the top of its stem. Tysonia has a long taproot and is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
