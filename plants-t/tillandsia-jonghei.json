    "intro": "Tillandsia jonghei, commonly known as the Jonghei air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It thrives by attaching itself to tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb water and sunlight. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink, adding an ornamental touch. Due to its unique growth habits and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
