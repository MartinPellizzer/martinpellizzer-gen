    "intro": "Touterea wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds that give it a graceful, tree-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas. The fronds are used in traditional crafts and have cultural significance in some island communities."
