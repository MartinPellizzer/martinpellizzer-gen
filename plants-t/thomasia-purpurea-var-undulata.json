    "intro": "Thomasia purpurea var. undulata, commonly known as the undulate thomasia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Stilbaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf margins. The plant produces small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native range."
