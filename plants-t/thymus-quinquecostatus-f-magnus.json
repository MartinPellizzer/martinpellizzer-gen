    "intro": "Thymus quinquecostatus f. magnus, commonly known as the large-leaf thyme, is a hirsute, low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, creeping stems that produce small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a thick, aromatic texture and a slightly serrated margin. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary use, though it is less commonly cultivated than other thyme species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
