    "intro": "Thlaspi marginatum, commonly known as the alpine cabbages or yellow cabbages, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and arctic regions, characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, with leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Thlaspi marginatum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
