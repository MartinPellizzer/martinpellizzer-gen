    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 rectifolia, commonly known as the silver vase tillandsia, is a hybrid bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, giving it a striking, almost metallic appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
