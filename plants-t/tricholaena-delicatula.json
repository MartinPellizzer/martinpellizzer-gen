    "intro": "Tricholaena delicatula, commonly known as the delicate tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. Its rhizome system allows it to spread and form dense clumps, contributing to its ecological role in forest understories. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
