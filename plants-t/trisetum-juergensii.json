The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open prairies and disturbed sites. Trisetum juergensii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
