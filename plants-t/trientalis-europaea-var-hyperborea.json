    "intro": "Trientalis europaea var. hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Siberia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its preference for cold climates, it is a rare and specialized species, adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
