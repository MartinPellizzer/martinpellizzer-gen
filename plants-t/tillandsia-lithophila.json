    "intro": "Tillandsia lithophila, commonly known as the rock tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its ability to grow on rocks or trees without soil. The plant has dense, grass-like foliage that helps it retain moisture in its epiphytic lifestyle. Its flowers are typically small and pale, often appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Tillandsia lithophila is well adapted to humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
