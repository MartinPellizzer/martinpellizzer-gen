    "intro": "Tibouchina sellowiana var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian violet or purple glorybower, is a striking flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and vibrant purple-pink inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of 2 to 6 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and the plant is well-suited for ornamental use in gardens due to its showy blooms and adaptability to various soil types. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
