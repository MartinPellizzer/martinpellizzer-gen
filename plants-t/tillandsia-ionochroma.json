    "intro": "Tillandsia ionochroma, commonly known as the red-tipped tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful foliage. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Its vibrant leaves, which can range from green to red and orange, make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. Tillandsia ionochroma thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
