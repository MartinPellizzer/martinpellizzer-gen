    "intro": "Terpsichore zeledoniana, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a unique flowering plant native to the humid tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branching stem covered in fine, soft hairs. Terpsichore zeledoniana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
