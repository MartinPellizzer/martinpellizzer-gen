    "intro": "Tillandsia spiculosa var. stenoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lipped airplant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, water-repelling trichomes, which aid in absorbing moisture from the air. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
