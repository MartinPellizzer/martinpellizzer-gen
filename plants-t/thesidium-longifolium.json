    "intro": "Thesidium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, violet-blue flowers arranged in a dense, spherical cluster known as a head. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs, which serve as a natural defense mechanism. Thesidium longifolium typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in meadows and grassy areas."
