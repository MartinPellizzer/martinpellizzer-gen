    "intro": "Thecophyllum pedicellatum, commonly known as the clustered leaf bladder, is a unique plant characterized by its specialized structures called bladders. These bladders are modified leaves that store water and nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in arid environments. The plant belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is native to regions with dry climates. Its growth habit is typically prostrate, with multiple branches forming a dense mat. The bladders are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which further reduces water loss and enhances its adaptation to harsh conditions."
