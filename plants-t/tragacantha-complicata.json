    "intro": "Tragacantha complicata, commonly known as the Persian gum or tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that produces distinctive yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer seasons. The plant is notable for its unique, branched, and often twisted stems, which give it its scientific name \"complicata,\" meaning \"twisted\" or \"complicated.\" Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant is also valued for its resin, which has been used historically in various medicinal and culinary applications."
