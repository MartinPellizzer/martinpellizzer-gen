    "intro": "Thymus funkii var. sabulicola, commonly known as sand thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
