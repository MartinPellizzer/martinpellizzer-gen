    "intro": "Thymus bracteosus subsp. aranjuezii, commonly known as the Aranjuez thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
