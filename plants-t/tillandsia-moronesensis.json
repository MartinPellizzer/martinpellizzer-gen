    "intro": "Tillandsia moronesensis, commonly known as the Morones' air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia moronesensis is adapted to humid environments and can thrive in indirect light conditions."
