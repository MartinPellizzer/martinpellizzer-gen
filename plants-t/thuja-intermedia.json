    "intro": "Thuja intermedia, commonly known as the American arborvitae, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and scale-like foliage that is dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental planting. Thuja intermedia is also valued for its aromatic wood and resistance to pests and diseases."
