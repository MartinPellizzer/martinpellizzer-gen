    "intro": "Thymus komarovii, commonly known as Komarov's thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
