    "intro": "Taraxacum valens, commonly known as the Valiant dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a distinctive yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. After flowering, it develops a fluffy white seed head, which is dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides."
