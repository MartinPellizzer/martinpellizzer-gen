    "intro": "Taraxacum subexpallidum, commonly known as the pale yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces a milky latex when damaged, a common trait among the dandelion genus. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
