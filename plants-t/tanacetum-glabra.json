    "intro": "Tanacetum glabra, commonly known as white tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. Tanacetum glabra is often used in traditional herbal remedies, though its use requires caution due to potential toxicity."
