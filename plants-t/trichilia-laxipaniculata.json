    "intro": "Trichilia laxipaniculata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hill forests. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
