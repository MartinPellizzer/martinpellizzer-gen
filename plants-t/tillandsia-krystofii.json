    "intro": "Tillandsia krystofii, commonly known as the Krystof's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid environments."
