    "intro": "Tragacantha coronilla, commonly known as crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces a distinctive pod-like fruit that contains several seeds. It is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
