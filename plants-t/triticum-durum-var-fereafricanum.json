    "intro": "Triticum durum var. fereafricanum, commonly known as the African durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its hard, high-protein grains that are well-suited for pasta and semolina production. The plant typically grows in warm, arid climates and has a short growing season, making it adaptable to drought-prone regions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves, compact spikes, and tough, straw-colored glumes. This variety is valued for its resilience and nutritional content, contributing to food security in regions where traditional wheat cultivation is challenging."
