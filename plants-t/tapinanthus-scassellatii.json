    "intro": "Tapinanthus scassellatii, commonly known as the parasitic morning glory, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from host plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in disturbed habitats and is often found growing on the roots of other plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host."
