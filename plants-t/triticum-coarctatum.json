    "intro": "Triticum coarctatum, commonly known as narrow-leafed wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is a grass species native to Central Asia and has a distinctive narrow, linear leaf shape. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has a compact growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with small, two-lobed glumes. Triticum coarctatum is of interest in plant genetics due to its potential for improving wheat traits through breeding programs."
