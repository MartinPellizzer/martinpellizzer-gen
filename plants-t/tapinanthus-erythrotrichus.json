    "intro": "Tapinanthus erythrotrichus, commonly known as the red-haired ghostflower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in color. It is native to regions of Africa and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
