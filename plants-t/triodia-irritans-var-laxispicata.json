    "intro": "Triodia irritans var. laxispicata, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and produces slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant's inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems. Its name reflects its irritant properties, as the leaves can cause skin irritation upon contact."
