    "intro": "Turnera odorata, commonly known as the fragrant turnera, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and emit a pleasant scent when crushed, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils. Turnera odorata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens."
