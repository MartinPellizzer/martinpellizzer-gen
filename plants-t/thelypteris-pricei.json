    "intro": "Thelypteris pricei, commonly known as the Price's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris pricei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
