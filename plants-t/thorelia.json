    "intro": "Thorelia, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Asia. Thorelia species are characterized by their striking, tubular flowers that often display vivid colors such as red, orange, and yellow. They typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The leaves are usually thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in their natural habitat."
