    "intro": "Taraxacum caloschistum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive, hollow stem with bracts, typical of the dandelion genus. Its leaves are usually basal, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Taraxacum caloschistum is often found in limestone soils and is well-suited to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained habitats."
