    "intro": "Trisetum molle subsp. alaskanum, commonly known as Alaska feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, wet meadows, and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
