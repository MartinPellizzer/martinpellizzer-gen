    "intro": "Tapinostemma meridianum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
