    "intro": "Tithymalus fendleri, commonly known as the desert tithymale, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Tithymalus fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
