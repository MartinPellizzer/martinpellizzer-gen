    "intro": "Thelypteris maxima, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish coating, which helps in water retention. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name."
