It features slender stems and lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
