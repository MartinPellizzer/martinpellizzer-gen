    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. This variety is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in agricultural settings. Its low-growing habit and dense foliage also make it an effective ground cover."
