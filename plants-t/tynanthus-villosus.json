    "intro": "Tynanthus villosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southern United States and is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that often grows in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds. Tynanthus villosus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
