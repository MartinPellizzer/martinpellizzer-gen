    "intro": "Trifolium ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's clover, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Trifolium ortegae is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
