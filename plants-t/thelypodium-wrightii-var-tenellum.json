It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds through a process called cleistogamy, where flowers close and self-pollinate."
