    "intro": "Tamarix anglica var. berthelotii, commonly known as the English tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, scale-like leaves and produces pink or pale pink flowers in summer. The plant is often found in coastal areas, saline soils, and disturbed sites due to its salt tolerance. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
