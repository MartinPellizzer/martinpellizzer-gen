    "intro": "Tradescantia axillaris var. flexuosa, commonly known as the silver spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features striking silver-green foliage with a velvety texture, and its leaves are often curled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture."
