    "intro": "Tillandsia alto-mayoensis, commonly known as the Alto Mayo air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often sought after by plant enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
