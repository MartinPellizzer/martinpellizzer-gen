    "intro": "Taraxacum montesignum, commonly known as the Montesignan dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a yellow flower head that develops into a hollow, umbrella-like structure known as a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has mild edible leaves similar to other dandelions."
