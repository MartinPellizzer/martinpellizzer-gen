    "intro": "Trifolium visianii, commonly known as the Visian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Trifolium visianii is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
