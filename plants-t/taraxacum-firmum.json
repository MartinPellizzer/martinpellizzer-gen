    "intro": "Taraxacum firmum, commonly known as the firm dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a fluffy, wind-borne pappus, which allows for wide distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum firmum is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
