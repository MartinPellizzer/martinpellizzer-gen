    "intro": "Trichosanthes himalensis var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim bottle gourd, is a climbing vine native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical, and often ribbed fruits that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are typically harvested when immature for culinary use, though they can also be left to mature for ornamental purposes. The plant is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, semi-shade conditions in its natural habitat."
