It is a liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or soil. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct lobed appearance, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are essential for its sexual reproduction. Triplisomeris triplisomeris plays a role in nutrient cycling in its ecosystem and is often found in temperate regions."
