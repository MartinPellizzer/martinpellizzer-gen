    "intro": "Trisetum kochianum, commonly known as the Koch's wood oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Trisetum kochianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments."
