    "intro": "Trigonochilum rusbyi, commonly known as the Rusby's trident-leaf, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique trident-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific pollinators, making it highly dependent on its ecosystem for survival. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Trigonochilum rusbyi is considered a threatened species in its native range."
