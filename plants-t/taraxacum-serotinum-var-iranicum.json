    "intro": "Taraxacum serotinum var. iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to regions of Iran and surrounding areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, elongated seed capsule, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Taraxacum species, including its leaf structure and flowering time."
