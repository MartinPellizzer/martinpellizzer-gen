    "intro": "Tupistra wattii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed yew, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Tupistra wattii is well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its slow growth rate and ornamental appearance make it a valued plant in horticulture and conservation efforts."
