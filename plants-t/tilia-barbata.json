    "intro": "Tilia barbata, commonly known as the barbed linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Tilia barbata is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can grow in a variety of habitats including woodlands and river valleys."
