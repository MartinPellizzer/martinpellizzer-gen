    "intro": "Tillandsia virescens, commonly known as the green tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is dense and grass-like, with a vibrant green color that helps it absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the dry season. Tillandsia virescens is well adapted to arid environments and can survive with minimal water, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
