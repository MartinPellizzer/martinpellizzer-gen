    "intro": "Trifolium hirtum var. urumovii, commonly known as the Urumov's hairy clover, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grassy areas or along the edges of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
