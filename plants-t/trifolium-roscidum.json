    "intro": "Trifolium roscidum, commonly known as the dewy clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is typically found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in temperate climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Trifolium roscidum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
