    "intro": "Thornbera villosa, commonly known as the hairy thornbera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, velvety hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Thornbera villosa typically grows in shrubland or forest edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive species within its native habitat."
