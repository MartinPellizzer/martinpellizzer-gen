    "intro": "Taxus mairei var. speciosa, commonly known as the Maire's yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
