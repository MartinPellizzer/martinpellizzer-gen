    "intro": "Trifolium monoense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Trifolium monoense thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It is a valuable forage plant for livestock and also serves as a nectar source for various pollinators."
