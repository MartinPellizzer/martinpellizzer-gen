    "intro": "Trifolium pallidum var. flavescens, commonly known as the pale clover, is a variant of the common clover species characterized by its pale green foliage and yellowish stems. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
