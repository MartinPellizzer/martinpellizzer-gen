    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. pseudouncinatum, commonly known as a wild emmer wheat, is a wild relative of domesticated wheat with significant genetic diversity. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and spikelets that often remain closed at maturity, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is adapted to a range of soil conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, tough grains that are resistant to shattering. This species is of interest to researchers for its potential role in crop improvement and genetic research."
