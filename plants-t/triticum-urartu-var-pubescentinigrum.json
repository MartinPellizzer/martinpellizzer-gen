    "intro": "Triticum urartu var. pubescentinigrum, commonly known as the wild emmer wheat, is a diploid species native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its glumes that are pubescent and often dark-colored, giving it its varietal name. This plant typically grows in temperate climates and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Its genetic makeup makes it an important resource for wheat breeding programs due to its wild relatives' genetic diversity. The plant has small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed spikes, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, protective glumes."
