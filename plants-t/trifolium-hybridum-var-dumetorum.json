    "intro": "Trifolium hybridum var. dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage crop for livestock."
