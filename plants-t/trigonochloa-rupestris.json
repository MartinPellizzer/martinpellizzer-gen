    "intro": "Trigonochloa rupestris, commonly known as the rock grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow along rocky or arid terrain. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Trigonochloa rupestris is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
