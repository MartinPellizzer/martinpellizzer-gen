    "intro": "Thymus acicularis var. ophioliticus, commonly known as the ophiolitic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It features tiny, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly encountered in its natural habitat."
