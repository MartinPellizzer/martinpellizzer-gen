    "intro": "Triumfetta microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved triumfetta, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Triumfetta microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
