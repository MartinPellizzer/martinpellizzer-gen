    "intro": "Thapsia villosa, commonly known as the woolly thapsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a similar fuzzy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Thapsia villosa is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
