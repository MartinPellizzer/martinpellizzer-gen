    "intro": "Triticum durum var. pilosohordeiforme, commonly known as the silky Hordeum-type durum wheat, is a variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. This plant exhibits a distinctive hairy appearance on its glumes and lemma, which sets it apart from typical durum wheat varieties. It is primarily found in specific geographic regions where its growth conditions are met. The botanical traits of this variant are of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity. Its classification within the Triticum genus highlights its close relation to other wheat species."
