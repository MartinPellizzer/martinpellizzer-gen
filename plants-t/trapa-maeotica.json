    "intro": "Trapa maeotica, commonly known as the Caspian water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the Caspian Sea region. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by spiny, woody fruits. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy substrates, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters. Trapa maeotica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
