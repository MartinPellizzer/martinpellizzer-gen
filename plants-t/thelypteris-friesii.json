    "intro": "Thelypteris friesii, commonly known as the Fries' holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris friesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
