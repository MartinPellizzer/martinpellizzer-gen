It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a valuable addition to xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
