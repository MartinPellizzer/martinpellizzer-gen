    "intro": "Tocoyena sprucei, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Tocoyena sprucei thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
