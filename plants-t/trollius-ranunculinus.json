    "intro": "Trollius ranunculinus, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its wet environment. Its stems are usually erect and can reach heights of up to 60 cm, supporting the clusters of flowers. Trollius ranunculinus is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in treating skin conditions and as a diuretic."
