    "intro": "Tardavel dibrachiata, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. The plant exhibits a unique epiphytic growth habit, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered, making conservation efforts critical for its survival."
