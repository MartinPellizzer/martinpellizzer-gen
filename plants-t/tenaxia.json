    "intro": "Tenaxia, commonly known as the sticky vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can adhere to surfaces through a sticky substance secreted by its nodes. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, often clustered in loose inflorescences. Tenaxia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
