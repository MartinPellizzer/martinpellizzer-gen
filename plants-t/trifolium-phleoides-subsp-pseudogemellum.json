    "intro": "Trifolium phleoides subsp. pseudogemellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slight pubescence. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are borne in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
