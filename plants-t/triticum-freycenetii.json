It is native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in southern Europe and North Africa. This plant is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in compact clusters. Triticum freycenetii is valued for its genetic diversity and potential contributions to wheat improvement programs."
