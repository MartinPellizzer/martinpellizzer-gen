It features striking silver-green leaves with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in loose, nutrient-rich soil. Botanists classify it within the Orchidaceae family, highlighting its unique reproductive and morphological traits."
