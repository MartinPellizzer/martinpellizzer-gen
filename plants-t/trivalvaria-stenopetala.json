    "intro": "Trivalvaria stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled trivalvaria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, aromatic leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
