    "intro": "Triodia irritans var. compacta, commonly known as the compact spinifex, is a hardy grassland plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a common component of coastal and inland grasslands. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions. Due to its resilience, it is often used in rehabilitation projects for degraded landscapes."
