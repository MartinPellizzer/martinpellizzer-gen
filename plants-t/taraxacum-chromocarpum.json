    "intro": "Taraxacum chromocarpum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that blooms in early spring. The plant produces a unique type of fruit called a chromocarp, which is a dry, one-seeded capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens."
