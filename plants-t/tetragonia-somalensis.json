    "intro": "Tetragonia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by succulent leaves and a preference for dry environments. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with fleshy, often lobed leaves that help it conserve water. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, rounded fruits. Tetragonia somalensis is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
