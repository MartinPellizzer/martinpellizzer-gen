It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close by morning. The plant produces small, green fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Thulinia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its unique blooming pattern makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
