    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum f. thellungianus, commonly known as the Thellungian thrift, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for both its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
