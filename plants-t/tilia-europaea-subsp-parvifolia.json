    "intro": "Tilia europaea subsp. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved lime, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Tilia europaea. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer and are followed by small, round fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in woodworking."
