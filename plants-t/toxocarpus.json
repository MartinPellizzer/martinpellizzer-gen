    "intro": "Toxocarpus, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain water in arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Many species of Toxocarpus are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Toxocarpus aculeatus and Toxocarpus acutifolius, which are native to regions in Africa and the Americas."
