    "intro": "Trattinnickia rhoifolia var. sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of South America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture, and its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh, cold climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
