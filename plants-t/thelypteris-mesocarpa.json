    "intro": "Thelypteris mesocarpa, commonly known as the middle-skin fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Its rhizome is usually short and creeping, supporting the growth of its foliage. Thelypteris mesocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
