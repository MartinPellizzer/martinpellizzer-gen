    "intro": "Trichophorum pumilum var. rollandii, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are usually found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or along the edges of ponds. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
