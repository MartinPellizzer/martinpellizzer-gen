    "intro": "Taraxacum hotakaense, commonly known as the Hotaka dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan, specifically the island of Hokkaido. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed head. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
