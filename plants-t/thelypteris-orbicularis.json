It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, fronds that are typically leathery and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris orbicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
