    "intro": "Triticum dicoccum var. pseudorubrispicatum, commonly known as black spelt, is a variety of spelt wheat characterized by its dark, almost black husks and compact spikelets. It is a hexaploid species, meaning it has six sets of chromosomes, which contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with alternate, narrow leaves that are hairy along the veins. Its flowers are arranged in spikes, and the grains are enclosed in tough, inedible glumes. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is often used in artisanal baking due to its distinct flavor and texture."
