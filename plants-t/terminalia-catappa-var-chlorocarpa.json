    "intro": "Terminalia catappa var. chlorocarpa, commonly known as the white buttonwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
