It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing a pale blue or purple color. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
