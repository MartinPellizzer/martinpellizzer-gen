It is characterized by its delicate, finely pubescent fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat. Thelypteris villosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
