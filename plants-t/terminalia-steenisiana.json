It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas and is valued for its hard, durable wood.
