    "intro": "Thelypteris porphyrophlebia, commonly known as the purple-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive dark green, leathery fronds with prominent purple veins that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps retain moisture. Thelypteris porphyrophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
