    "intro": "Trifolium montanum var. rubriflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bright red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
