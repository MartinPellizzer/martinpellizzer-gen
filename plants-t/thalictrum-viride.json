    "intro": "Thalictrum viride, commonly known as green meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a unique visual appeal to gardens. Thalictrum viride prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
