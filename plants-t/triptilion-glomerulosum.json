    "intro": "Triptilion glomerulosum, commonly known as the clustered spike moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and small, elongated leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant typically forms compact cushions or mats, which help it retain moisture in its preferred moist, shaded habitats. Triptilion glomerulosum is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are relatively simple and consist of a single spore capsule atop a short stalk."
