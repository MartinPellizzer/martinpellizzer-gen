It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a yellow coloration that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tanacetum ceratophylloides is known for its strong, aromatic scent and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
