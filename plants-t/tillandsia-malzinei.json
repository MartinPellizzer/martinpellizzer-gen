    "intro": "Tillandsia malzinei, commonly known as the Malzini's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can trap moisture from the air. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, often appearing in shades of white or pale purple. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
