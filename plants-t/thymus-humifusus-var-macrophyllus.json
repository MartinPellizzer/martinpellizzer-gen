    "intro": "Thymus humifusus var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features prostrate stems that are covered in small, glandular hairs, which contribute to its aromatic properties. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, distinguishing it from other thyme varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
