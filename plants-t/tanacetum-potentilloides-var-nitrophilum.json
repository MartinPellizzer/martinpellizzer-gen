    "intro": "Tanacetum potentilloides var. nitrophilum, commonly known as the nitrophilous tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flower heads. This variety thrives in nutrient-rich soils, often found in disturbed or calcareous habitats. The plant produces small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to colonize and stabilize degraded soils."
