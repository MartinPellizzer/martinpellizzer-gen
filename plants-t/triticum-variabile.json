    "intro": "Triticum variabile, commonly known as variable wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its variable growth habits, often appearing as a loose, sprawling plant with slender stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the seeds are enclosed in small, hard grains. Triticum variabile is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
