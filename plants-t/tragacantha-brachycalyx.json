    "intro": "Tragacantha brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a distinctive gum, which is often harvested for its medicinal and industrial uses. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture. Due to its resilience, it is often found in semi-desert environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
