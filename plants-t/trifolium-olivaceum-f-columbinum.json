    "intro": "Trifolium olivaceum f. columbinum, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, globular heads, typical of the legume family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
