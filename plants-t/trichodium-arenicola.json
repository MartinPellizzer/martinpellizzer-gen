    "intro": "Trichodium arenicola, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in arid and coastal environments. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen is typically found on bare rock surfaces, sandy soils, and in other harsh, nutrient-poor habitats. Its structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. Trichodium arenicola plays a vital ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing microhabitats for other organisms in extreme environments."
