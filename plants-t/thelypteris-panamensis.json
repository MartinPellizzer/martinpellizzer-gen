    "intro": "Thelypteris panamensis, commonly known as the Panama holly fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Thelypteris panamensis thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its structure and reproductive features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
