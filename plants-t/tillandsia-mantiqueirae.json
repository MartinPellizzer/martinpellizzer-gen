    "intro": "Tillandsia mantiqueirae, commonly known as the Mantiqueira air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia mantiqueirae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity."
