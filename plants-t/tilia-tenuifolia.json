    "intro": "Tilia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. Tilia tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
