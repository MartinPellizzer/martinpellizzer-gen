    "intro": "Trimezia, commonly known as the golden crownflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to various regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Trimezia species are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers, often with a distinctive crown-like structure at the base. They typically grow in high-altitude environments and are adapted to cool, moist conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
