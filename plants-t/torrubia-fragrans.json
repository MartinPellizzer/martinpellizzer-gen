    "intro": "Torrubia fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented torrubia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. It has small, leathery leaves and produces dark red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
