    "intro": "Taraxacum oistophorum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, hairy stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Taraxacum oistophorum is often found in alpine meadows and is considered an indicator species for arid and semi-arid habitats."
