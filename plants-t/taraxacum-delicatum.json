    "intro": "Taraxacum delicatum, commonly known as the delicate dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers bloom from spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
