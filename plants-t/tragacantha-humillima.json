    "intro": "Tragacantha humillima, commonly known as the dwarf tragacanth, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a sticky resin, similar to that of other tragacanth species, which has been used historically in traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
