    "intro": "Taraxacum vulpinum, commonly known as the foxed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, elongated seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. Taraxacum vulpinum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
