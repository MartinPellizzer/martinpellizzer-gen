    "intro": "Trigonospora glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, triangular stems that are often covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to store water in its thick stems. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
