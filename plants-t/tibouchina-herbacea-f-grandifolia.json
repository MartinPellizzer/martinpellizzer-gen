    "intro": "Tibouchina herbacea f. grandifolia, commonly known as the grandiflora tibouchina, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dark green, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture and produces clusters of showy, violet-blue flowers throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established and has a compact growth habit that makes it ideal for container gardening. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, adding ecological value to the landscape."
