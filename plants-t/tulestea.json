    "intro": "Tulestea, commonly known as the desert rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tulestea is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its stems and having a shallow root system. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
