    "intro": "Taraxacum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, hairless leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate regions. This plant is notable for its ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution."
