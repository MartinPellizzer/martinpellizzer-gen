    "intro": "Trillium virginianum, commonly known as the Wake Robin, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broadly elliptic leaves that are opposite and arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in shaded environments. Trillium virginianum is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, sometimes living for several decades."
