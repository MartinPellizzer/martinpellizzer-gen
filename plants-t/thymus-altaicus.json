    "intro": "Thymus altaicus, commonly known as the Altai thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Thymus altaicus is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
