    "intro": "Taraxacum callosum, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces fluffy seeds. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States, it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability. Its common name reflects the soft, woolly texture of its foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments."
