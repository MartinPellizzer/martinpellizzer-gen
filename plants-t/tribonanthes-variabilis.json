    "intro": "Tribonanthes variabilis, commonly known as the variable tribonema, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
