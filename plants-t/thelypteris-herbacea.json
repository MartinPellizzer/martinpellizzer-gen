    "intro": "Thelypteris herbacea, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with upright, lance-shaped fronds that are often deeply divided. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris herbacea plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
