    "intro": "Taraxacum parile, commonly known as the Paril dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head consisting of a pappus that aids in its propagation. Taraxacum parile is often found in open areas and is adapted to full sun exposure."
