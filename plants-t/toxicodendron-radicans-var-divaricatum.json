    "intro": "Toxicodendron radicans var. divaricatum, commonly known as the southern itchleaf or eastern poison ivy, is a variant of the broad-leaf poison ivy. It is a deciduous vine or shrub native to the eastern United States, characterized by its trifoliate leaves with three leaflets. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation and itching upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle without protection."
