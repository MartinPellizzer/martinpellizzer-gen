    "intro": "Taraxacum navarrense, commonly known as the Navarre dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a hollow, wind-dispersed seed sphere. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar composite flower structures. Taraxacum navarrense is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
