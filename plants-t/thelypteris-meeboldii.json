    "intro": "Thelypteris meeboldii, commonly known as the Meebold's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or semi-upright in growth habit. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. Thelypteris meeboldii is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both horticultural collections and ecological studies."
