    "intro": "Thelypteris silvatica, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. Thelypteris silvatica plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
