    "intro": "Taraxacum lawalreei, commonly known as the Hawaiian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a rosette of basal leaves. Its flowers are yellow and produce a wind-dispersed seed head, similar to other dandelions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
