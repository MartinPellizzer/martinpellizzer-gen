    "intro": "Trichilia microphyllina, commonly known as the small-leaved trichilia, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Trichilia microphyllina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
