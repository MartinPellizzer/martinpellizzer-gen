    "intro": "Turrita alpestris, commonly known as the alpine turritella, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically pale blue or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, adapted to withstand cold and harsh alpine conditions. Turrita alpestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes."
