    "intro": "Triticum flabellatum, commonly known as the flaxleaf wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. While not widely cultivated for grain, it is of interest in botanical studies for its ecological and evolutionary significance."
