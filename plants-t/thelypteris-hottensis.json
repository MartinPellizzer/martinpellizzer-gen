    "intro": "Thelypteris hottensis, commonly known as the Hottentot water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris hottensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
