    "intro": "Trichomanes dissectum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes dissectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
