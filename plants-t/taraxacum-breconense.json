    "intro": "Taraxacum breconense, commonly known as the Brecon dandelion, is a rare and endangered species of dandelion native to southern Wales. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and distinctive, deeply lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered one of the rarest dandelions in the UK."
