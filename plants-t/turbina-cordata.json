    "intro": "Turbina cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf turban snail, is a species of air plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the rosette. This plant is native to South America and thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light."
