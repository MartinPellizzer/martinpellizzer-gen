    "intro": "Thelypteris snufkin, commonly known as the Snufkin fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping in appearance. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, tropical climates."
