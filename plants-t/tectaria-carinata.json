It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds with a prominent midrib and a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Tectaria carinata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in various regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
