    "intro": "Toxicodendron griffithii var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited poison ivy, is a variant of the poison ivy plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically shiny and have a slight serration along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by clusters of small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that can cause severe skin irritation and rashes upon contact. This variant is often found in forested areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments."
