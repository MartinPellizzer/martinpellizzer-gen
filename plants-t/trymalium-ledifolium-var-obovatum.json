The plant features opposite, ovate to obovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
