    "intro": "Taraxacum sieheaniforme, commonly known as the Sieheaniform dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head develops into a ball of white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures, which are dispersed by the wind. This plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is a perennial species that is well adapted to temperate climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
