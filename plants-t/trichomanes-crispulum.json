    "intro": "Trichomanes crispulum, commonly known as the crested maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a wavy or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Trichomanes crispulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
