    "intro": "Thymus richardii subsp. nitidus, commonly known as the smooth thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in culinary applications."
