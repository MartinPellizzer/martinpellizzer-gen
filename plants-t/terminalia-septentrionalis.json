    "intro": "Terminalia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern terminalia, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
