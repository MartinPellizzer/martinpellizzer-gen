    "intro": "Thelocactus rinconensis subsp. multicephalus, commonly known as the \"multicephalous cactus,\" is a rare and distinctive species native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its short, thick stems that often branch into multiple heads, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is highly sought after by collectors due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
