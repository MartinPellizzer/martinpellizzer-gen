    "intro": "Thelypteris burundensis, commonly known as Burundi shield fern, is a species of fern native to the montane forests of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Thelypteris burundensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
