It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Trichodium effusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
