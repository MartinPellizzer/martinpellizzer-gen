    "intro": "Thymus gibbosus, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses."
