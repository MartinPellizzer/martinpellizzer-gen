    "intro": "Taraxacum myvatnense, commonly known as the Myvatn dandelion, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Iceland. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic regions. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
