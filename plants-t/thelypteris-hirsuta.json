    "intro": "Thelypteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Thelypteris hirsuta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden landscapes."
