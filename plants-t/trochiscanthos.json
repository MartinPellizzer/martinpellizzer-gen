    "intro": "Trochiscanthos, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often ribbed and can exude a milky sap when broken. Trochiscanthos is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky areas."
