    "intro": "Taraxacum officinale subsp. fontanum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head produces a cluster of bright yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seeds with parachute-like structures. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its edible leaves and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
