    "intro": "Tridactyle minuta, commonly known as the minute tridactyle, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tridactyle minuta is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
