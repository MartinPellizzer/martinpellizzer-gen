    "intro": "Trisetum projectum, commonly known as the spreading hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing a single floret. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Trisetum projectum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
