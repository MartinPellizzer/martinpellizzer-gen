It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive silvery sheen on their upper surface. Trineuria ciliaris is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
