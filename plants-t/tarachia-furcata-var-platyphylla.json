    "intro": "Tarachia furcata var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, branching stems and lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The species is known for its ability to store water in its thick stems, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
