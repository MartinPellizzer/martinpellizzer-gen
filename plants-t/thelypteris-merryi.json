    "intro": "Thelypteris merryi, commonly known as the Merry's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris merryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
