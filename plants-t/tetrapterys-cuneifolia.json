    "intro": "Tetrapterys cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in desert environments."
