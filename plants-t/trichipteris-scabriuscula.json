    "intro": "Trichipteris scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough leaved fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its wiry, scabrous fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Trichipteris scabriuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
