    "intro": "Trillium crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and has three large, broadly ovate leaves that are usually a deep green. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads primarily through rhizomes. Trillium crassifolium is considered a valuable component of forest ecosystems due to its role in nutrient cycling and habitat provision."
