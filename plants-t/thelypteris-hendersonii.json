    "intro": "Thelypteris hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris hendersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, feathery appearance."
