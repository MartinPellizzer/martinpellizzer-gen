    "intro": "Trillium catesbaei, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its three white petals, three sepals, and three heart-shaped leaves, which are all present from the start of its growth cycle. The plant typically blooms in early spring, with flowers that are pollinated by insects such as flies and beetles. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and is often found in shaded environments. Trillium catesbaei is a long-lived species, with some individuals surviving for over 50 years."
