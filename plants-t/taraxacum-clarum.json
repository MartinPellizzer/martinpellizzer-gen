    "intro": "Taraxacum clarum, commonly known as the clear dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a distinctive, hollow, leafless stem that supports the flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically basal, alternate, and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant is known for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
