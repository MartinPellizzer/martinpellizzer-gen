    "intro": "Tragacantha lagurus, commonly known as the Persian gum or Astragalus lagurus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by the formation of distinctive, inflated pods. It is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy species adapted to semi-arid and arid climates. The plant's roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of desert vegetation."
