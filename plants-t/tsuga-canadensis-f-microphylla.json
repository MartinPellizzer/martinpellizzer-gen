    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf hemlock, is a compact form of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its smaller, more densely packed needles compared to the typical eastern hemlock. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its slow growth rate makes it a long-lived plant, sometimes reaching ages of over 500 years. The plant's unique foliage and slow growth make it a desirable specimen for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
