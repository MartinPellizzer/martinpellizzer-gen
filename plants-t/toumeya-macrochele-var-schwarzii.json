    "intro": "Toumeya macrochele var. schwarzii, commonly known as the Schwarz's giant fern, is a rare and striking member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
