    "intro": "Thelypteris cheilanthoides var. mucosa, commonly known as the mucous holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its leathery, glossy fronds that are often covered in a fine, mucilaginous coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
