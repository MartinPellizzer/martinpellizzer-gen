    "intro": "Tetrapterys lundiana var. primaeva, commonly known as the early-flowering tetrapterys, is a lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, preceding the leaves in a unique seasonal pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and understudied species."
