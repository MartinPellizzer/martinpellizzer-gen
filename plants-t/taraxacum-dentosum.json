    "intro": "Taraxacum dentosum, commonly known as the toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lance-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive through winter dormancy. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator support."
