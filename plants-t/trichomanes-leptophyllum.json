    "intro": "Trichomanes leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of moisture, typical of its epiphytic growth habit. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes leptophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
