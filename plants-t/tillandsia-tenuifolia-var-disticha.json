    "intro": "Tillandsia tenuifolia var. disticha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf airplant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
