    "intro": "Tragia collina, commonly known as the prickly stick or desert stick, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tragia collina is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
