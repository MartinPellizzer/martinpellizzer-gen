It is a hybrid between Thelypteris acutifrons and Thelypteris gymanthera, exhibiting characteristics of both parents. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated margin and a distinctive, elongated shape. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies on rocky outcrops and woodland soils. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
