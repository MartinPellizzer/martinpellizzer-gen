    "intro": "Telipogon crisariasiae, commonly known as the Philippine grass. It is a rare grass species native to the Philippines, characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
