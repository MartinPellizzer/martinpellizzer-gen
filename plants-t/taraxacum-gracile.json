    "intro": "Taraxacum gracile, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pale green leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into a spherical, fluffy seed head known as a pappus. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common and recognizable weed in temperate regions."
