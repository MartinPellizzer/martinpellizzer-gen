    "intro": "Theodorea tenuis, commonly known as the slender theodorea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the early morning. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
