    "intro": "Tillandsia maxima, commonly known as the giant air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia maxima can grow up to several feet in height, making it one of the largest species in the Tillandsia genus."
