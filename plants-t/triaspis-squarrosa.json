    "intro": "Triaspis squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Triaspis squarrosa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
