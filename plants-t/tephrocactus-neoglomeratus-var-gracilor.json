    "intro": "Tephrocactus neoglomeratus var. gracilor, commonly known as the slender cluster cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, cylindrical stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne in clusters at the stem tips. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in desert gardens."
