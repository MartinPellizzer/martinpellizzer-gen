    "intro": "Tragacantha squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its latex sap, similar to that of other tragacanth species, has been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges."
