    "intro": "Thymus pulegioides var. jaquetianus, commonly known as the Jaquetian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features compact, creeping stems that produce small, oval-shaped leaves with a dense, fuzzy texture. The plant blooms with tiny, pale pink to white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong thyme scent and making it useful in herbal medicine and culinary applications. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
