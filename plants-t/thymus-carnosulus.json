    "intro": "Thymus carnosulus, commonly known as purple thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, woody stems covered with tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically a vibrant purple or pinkish hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep violet, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often used in cooking and traditional medicine due to their high concentration of essential oils. Thymus carnosulus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
