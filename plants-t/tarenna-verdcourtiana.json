    "intro": "Tarenna verdcourtiana, commonly known as the Madagascar star anise, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped fruits that resemble those of the star anise, though it is not related to the commercially used star anise. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
