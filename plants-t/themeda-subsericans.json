    "intro": "Themeda subsericans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Themeda subsericans plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small fauna."
