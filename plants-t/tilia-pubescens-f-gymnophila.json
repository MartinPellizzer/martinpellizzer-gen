    "intro": "Tilia pubescens f. gymnophila, commonly known as the hairy lime or woolly lime, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the lime tree. It is characterized by its dense, pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to typical lime trees. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities, particularly its soft, textured foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
