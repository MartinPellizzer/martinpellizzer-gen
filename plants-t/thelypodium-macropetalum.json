    "intro": "Thelypodium macropetalum, commonly known as the large-petaled thelypodium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Thelypodium macropetalum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
