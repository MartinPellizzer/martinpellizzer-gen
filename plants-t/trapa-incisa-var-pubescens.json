    "intro": "Trapa incisa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, indehiscent fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin, and the submerged stems bear small, white flowers. The hairy pubescence on its leaves and fruits distinguishes this variety from other Trapa species."
