    "intro": "Trichocereus skottsbergii var. breviatus, commonly known as the \"Candelabra Cactus,\" is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its short, columnar stems that branch into multiple arms, giving it a distinctive candelabra-like appearance. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers during the night, which are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are usually present in young plants but are reduced to spines in mature individuals. This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
