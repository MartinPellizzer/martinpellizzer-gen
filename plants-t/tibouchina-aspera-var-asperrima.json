It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and broad, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
