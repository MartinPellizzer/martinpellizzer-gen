    "intro": "Tulipa serotina, commonly known as the late tulip, is a species native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial bulbous plant that produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, making it one of the later-flowering tulip species. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulbs are relatively small compared to other tulip varieties. Tulipa serotina is valued in gardens for its vibrant colors and ability to naturalize over time."
