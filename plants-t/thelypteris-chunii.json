    "intro": "Thelypteris chunii, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. Thelypteris chunii thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a houseplant."
