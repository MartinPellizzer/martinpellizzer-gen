    "intro": "Trichogyne laricifolia, commonly known as the mountain pine or whitebark pine, is a species of conifer native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, scaly bark and edible, nut-like seeds that are a food source for various wildlife species. The plant has a long lifespan and can live for several centuries, making it a keystone species in its ecosystem. Its cones are serotinous, meaning they remain closed until exposed to heat from a forest fire, ensuring seed dispersal after a disturbance. The tree plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and maintaining biodiversity in high-altitude environments."
