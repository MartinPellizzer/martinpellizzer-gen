    "intro": "Tectaria semipinnata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Its fronds are often covered with a dense layer of small, scale-like structures that provide protection. Tectaria semipinnata is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
