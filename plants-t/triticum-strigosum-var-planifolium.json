    "intro": "Triticum strigosum var. planifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its flat, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
