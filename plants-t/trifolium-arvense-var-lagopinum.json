    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. lagopinum, commonly known as red clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, often with a red or pinkish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Trifolium arvense var. lagopinum is also valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
