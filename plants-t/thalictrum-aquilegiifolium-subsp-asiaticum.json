It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical structure supports its role as an early-season pollinator attractor."
