    "intro": "Tritonia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple, often with a contrasting white or yellow throat. The plant produces small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Tritonia sanguinea is typically found growing in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
