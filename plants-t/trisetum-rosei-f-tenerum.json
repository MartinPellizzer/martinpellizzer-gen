    "intro": "Trisetum rosei f. tenerum, commonly known as the soft-haired wood rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and grass-like foliage. It features slender, erect stems that bear dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow, smooth, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a distinctive texture. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
