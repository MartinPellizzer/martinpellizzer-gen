It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in soft, downy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound racemes, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a feathery or finely divided structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
