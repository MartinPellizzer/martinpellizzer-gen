    "intro": "Tragopogon dasyrhynchus, commonly known as the roughhead thistle, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly leaves and a flowering head that consists of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in dense, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a yellow color that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
