    "intro": "Thelypteris flavoviridis, commonly known as the yellow-green holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle yellowish tinge. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris flavoviridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
