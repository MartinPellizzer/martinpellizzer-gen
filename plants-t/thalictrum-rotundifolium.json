It features delicate, fern-like foliage with rounded, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
