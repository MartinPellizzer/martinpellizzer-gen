    "intro": "Tapinanthus subquadrangularis, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It has a distinctive appearance with yellowish-orange stems that are often angular in cross-section. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its roots are specialized for attachment to host plants, allowing it to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if left unchecked."
