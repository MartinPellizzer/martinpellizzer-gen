    "intro": "Taraxacum artificis, commonly known as the artificial dandelion, is a species within the genus Taraxacum, which includes various dandelion-like plants. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, yellow flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance. It produces a seed head that disperses seeds via wind, a common trait among plants in the Asteraceae family. However, unlike most dandelions, Taraxacum artificis is not commonly found in the wild and is often grown in controlled environments."
