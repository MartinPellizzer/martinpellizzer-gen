    "intro": "Triticum monococcum subsp. aegilopoides, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a diploid grass with small, glabrous seeds that are typically brown to reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain several florets. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields. This species is of interest in plant breeding for its potential genetic contributions to cultivated wheat varieties."
