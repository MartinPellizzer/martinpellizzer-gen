    "intro": "Tapinanthus ogowensis var. batesii, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a vine-like growth habit. It is often found growing on shrubs and trees in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
