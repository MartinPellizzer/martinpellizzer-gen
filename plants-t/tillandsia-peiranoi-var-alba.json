    "intro": "Tillandsia peiranoi var. alba, commonly known as the White Tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that is covered in a layer of fine, white trichomes, which aid in water absorption. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
