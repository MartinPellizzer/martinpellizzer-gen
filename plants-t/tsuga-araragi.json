    "intro": "Tsuga araragi, commonly known as the Japanese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It belongs to the genus Tsuga in the family Pinaceae, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as mountainous regions, and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its foliage is dense and dark green, with a distinctive blue-gray tinge on the underside of the needles. The cones are small and cylindrical, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
