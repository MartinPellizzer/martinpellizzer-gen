    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 requienii, commonly known as the wild wheat or goat grass, is a hybrid species within the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, two-rowed florets. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its genetic makeup results from the cross between Triticum monococcum and Triticum aestivum, contributing to its unique botanical features. This species plays a role in the evolution of cultivated wheat varieties due to its genetic diversity."
