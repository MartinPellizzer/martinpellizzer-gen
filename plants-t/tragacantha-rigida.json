It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pods containing small, hard seeds. Its roots are known for producing a viscous gum, which has been historically used in various medicinal and industrial applications. Tragacantha rigida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
