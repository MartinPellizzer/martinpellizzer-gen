    "intro": "Tounatea recurva, commonly known as the twisted tounatea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, spirally twisted stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Tounatea recurva is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique growth form."
