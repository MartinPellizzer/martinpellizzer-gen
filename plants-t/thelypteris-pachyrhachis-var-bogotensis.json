    "intro": "Thelypteris pachyrhachis var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and montane habitats. The plant features fronds that are leathery and deeply divided, with a distinctive appearance that resembles holly leaves, hence its common name. Its rhizomes are robust and help it establish in rocky or soil-rich substrates. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
