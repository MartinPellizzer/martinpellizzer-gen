    "intro": "Trichosiphon, commonly known as the \"spiny sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny leaves and showy, often purple or blue flowers. These plants are typically found in coastal regions and sandy soils, where they thrive in saline environments. Trichosiphon species are perennial herbs that can grow up to several feet tall, with woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Their botanical features make them well adapted to harsh, maritime conditions."
