    "intro": "Troximon heterophyllum var. californicum, commonly known as the California troximon, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate of its native habitat. It produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
