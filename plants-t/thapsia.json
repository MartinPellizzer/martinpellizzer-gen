Thapsia species are typically found in coastal areas and rocky soils, adapting well to saline and arid environments. They produce small, tubular flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Thapsia coronaria and Thapsia latifolia being among the most commonly recognized."
