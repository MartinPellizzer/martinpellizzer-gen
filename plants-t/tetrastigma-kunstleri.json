    "intro": "Tetrastigma kunstleri, commonly known as the climbing vine or Chinese raisin vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the grape family, Vitaceae. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to climb using tendrils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often used in traditional medicine. The berries, when ripe, turn red or black and are edible, though they are not commonly consumed in modern times."
