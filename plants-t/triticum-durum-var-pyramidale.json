    "intro": "Triticum durum var. pyramidale, commonly known as durum wheat, is a variety of wheat characterized by its high gluten content and hard kernels. It is primarily cultivated for the production of semolina, which is used in pasta and other food products. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The seeds are enclosed in a tough, inedible hull, which is removed during processing to produce the usable grain."
