    "intro": "Thelypteris killipii, commonly known as Killip's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Thelypteris killipii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
