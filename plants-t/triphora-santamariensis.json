    "intro": "Triphora santamariensis, commonly known as the Santa Maria triphora, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, tubular, and typically arranged in whorls along the stems, producing a subtle display of pink to purple hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
