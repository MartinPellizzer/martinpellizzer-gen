    "intro": "Tribulus arvensis, commonly known as puncture vine, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits that contain hard, sharp seeds, which can cause irritation if they come into contact with skin. Tribulus arvensis is often considered a weed in agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
