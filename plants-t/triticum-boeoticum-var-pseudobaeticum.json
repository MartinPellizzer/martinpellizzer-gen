    "intro": "Triticum boeoticum var. pseudobaeticum, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic similarity to domesticated wheat, it has been studied for its potential role in breeding programs for improved crop resilience."
