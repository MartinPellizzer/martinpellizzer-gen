    "intro": "Trichomanes zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's structure resembles that of true ferns, but it lacks the typical fronds and instead has a more compact, moss-like appearance. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on evolutionary adaptations in ferns."
