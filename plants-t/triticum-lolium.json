    "intro": "Triticum lolium, commonly known as ryegrass, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is widely distributed across temperate regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is known for its rapid growth and adaptability. Ryegrass is also cultivated for forage and is used in turfgrass mixtures due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. Its seed heads are typically green to purple in color, depending on the species and environmental conditions."
