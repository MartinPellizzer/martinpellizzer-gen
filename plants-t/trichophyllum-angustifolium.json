    "intro": "Trichophyllum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved trichophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features lance-shaped, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or greenish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
