It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
