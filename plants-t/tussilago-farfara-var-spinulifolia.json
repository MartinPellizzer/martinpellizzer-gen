    "intro": "Tussilago farfara var. spinulifolia, commonly known as the spiny thistle, is a variant of the common coltsfoot. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a rosette of thick, hairy, and spiny leaves that help it retain moisture and deter herbivores. Its flowers are yellow and appear in the spring, followed by the development of prickly, spherical seed heads. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a range of environmental conditions."
