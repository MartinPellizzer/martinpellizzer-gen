    "intro": "Tillandsia arenicola, commonly known as the sand tillandsia, is a unique air plant native to the dry regions of South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained environments and is adapted to arid conditions. This plant lacks traditional roots and absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. Its rosette-shaped foliage is covered in dense, fuzzy trichomes that aid in water retention. Tillandsia arenicola is often found growing on rocks or in coastal dunes, showcasing its resilience to harsh climates."
