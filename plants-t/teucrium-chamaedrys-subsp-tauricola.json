    "intro": "Teucrium chamaedrys subsp. tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric rock rose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It typically features aromatic, narrow leaves with a silver-gray underside, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
