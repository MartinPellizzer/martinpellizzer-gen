    "intro": "Tripteris burchellii, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Tripteridaceae and is characterized by its fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This bioluminescence is due to the presence of luciferin and luciferase enzymes in its tissues."
