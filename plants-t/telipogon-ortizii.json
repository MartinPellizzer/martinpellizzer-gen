    "intro": "Telipogon ortizii, commonly known as the Ortiz's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated inflorescence bearing small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Telipogon ortizii is considered a vulnerable species."
