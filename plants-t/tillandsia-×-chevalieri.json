    "intro": "Tillandsia \u00d7 chevalieri, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives by attaching itself to trees and other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air through its dense, hanging foliage. The plant does not parasitize its host but instead relies on environmental humidity and rainfall for survival. Its long, thread-like leaves form intricate, cascading clusters that can grow quite heavy over time. While it is often mistaken for a parasitic plant, Tillandsia \u00d7 chevalieri is actually a non-photosynthetic species that relies on its surroundings for sustenance."
