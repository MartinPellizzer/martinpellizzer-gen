It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
