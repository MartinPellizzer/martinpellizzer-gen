    "intro": "Taraxacum amplexum, commonly known as the broadleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head, which develops into a distinctive spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The broadleaf dandelion is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
