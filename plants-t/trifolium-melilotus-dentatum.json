    "intro": "Trifolium melilotus-dentatum, commonly known as the serrated sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Trifolium melilotus-dentatum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in agriculture and traditional medicine."
