    "intro": "Triticum repens var. multiflorum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
