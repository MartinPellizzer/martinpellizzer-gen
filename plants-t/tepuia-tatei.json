    "intro": "Tepuia tatei, commonly known as the Taiti orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet and white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Its blooming period occurs during the wet season, adding a splash of color to the otherwise barren landscape. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, Tepuia tatei is considered a rare and endangered species."
