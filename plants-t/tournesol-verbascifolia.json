    "intro": "Tournesol verbascifolia, commonly known as the yellow sunflower, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of smaller, darker yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tournesol verbascifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in full sun."
