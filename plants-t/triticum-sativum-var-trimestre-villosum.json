    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. trimestre-villosum, commonly known as the three-leaf wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. This variety exhibits a distinct growth pattern with three leaves emerging from the base of the plant, which sets it apart from typical wheat species. Botanically, it possesses a spikelet structure with a reduced number of florets, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant's leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its unique genetic and structural traits."
