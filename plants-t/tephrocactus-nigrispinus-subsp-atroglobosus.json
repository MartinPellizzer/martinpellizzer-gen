    "intro": "Tephrocactus nigrispinus subsp. atroglobosus, commonly known as the black-spined globose cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its globular shape and dark, spiny ribs that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a contrasting color to its dark structure. Native to Mexico, it thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized cactus gardens."
