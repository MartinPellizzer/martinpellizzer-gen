    "intro": "Taxodium distichum var. ascendens, commonly known as the bald cypress, is a deciduous conifer native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its feathery, scale-like leaves that turn a striking orange-red in the fall before dropping. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is fibrous and peels in long, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is well adapted to wetland environments and can tolerate prolonged flooding."
