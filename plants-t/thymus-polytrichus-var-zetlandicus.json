It features small, aromatic leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme scent when crushed. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
