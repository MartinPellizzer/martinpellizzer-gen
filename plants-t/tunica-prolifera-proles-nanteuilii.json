    "intro": "Tunica prolifera proles nanteuilii, commonly known as the Nanteuil's tunica, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant characterized by its unique growth pattern. It forms dense, mat-like structures on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant's morphology includes elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in fine, translucent hairs. Its reproductive structures are typically submerged, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
