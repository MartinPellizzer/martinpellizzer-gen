    "intro": "Trifolium reflexum var. virginicum, commonly known as white clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of soil types, often found in lawns, fields, and disturbed areas. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. White clover is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a beneficial plant for agricultural and ecological purposes."
