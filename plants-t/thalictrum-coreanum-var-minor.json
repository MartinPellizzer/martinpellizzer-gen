    "intro": "Thalictrum coreanum var. minor, commonly known as the Korean meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and often covered in a soft, silky texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in compound umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
