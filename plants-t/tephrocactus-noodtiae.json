    "intro": "Tephrocactus noodtiae, commonly known as the Noodt's cactus, is a rare and compact cactus native to Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a ribbed structure and is covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings."
