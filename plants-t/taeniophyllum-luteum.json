    "intro": "Taeniophyllum luteum, commonly known as the yellow tailed orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments, relying on its host for support rather than soil. The plant features delicate, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Taeniophyllum luteum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
