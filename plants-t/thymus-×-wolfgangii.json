    "intro": "Thymus \u00d7 wolfgangii, commonly known as the hybrid thyme, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in small groups. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Thymus \u00d7 wolfgangii is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses, though it is often grown for its fragrant foliage rather than its flowers."
