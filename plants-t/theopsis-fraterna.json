    "intro": "Theopsis fraterna, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the winter season. The plant has a compact, succulent-like growth habit, with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Theopsis fraterna is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
