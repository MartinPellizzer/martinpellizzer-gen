    "intro": "Tectaria burmanica, commonly known as the Burmese shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Tectaria burmanica is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
