It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, it is well adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
