    "intro": "Trifolium ambiguum var. majus, commonly known as the greater hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, curved seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
