    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. japschorvi, commonly known as Japanese wheat, is a variant of bread wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. It typically exhibits a compact plant structure with shorter stems and broader leaves compared to standard wheat varieties. The grains are usually smaller and have a distinct glume morphology, which aids in seed dispersal. This variety is adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated for its resilience to certain environmental stresses. Its botanical traits make it an important subject in agricultural research and genetic studies."
