    "intro": "Thesium tepuiense, commonly known as the tepui thesium, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the highland grasslands, known as tepuis, which are found in the Guiana Highlands. Thesium tepuiense is often found growing in open areas with good sunlight exposure, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
