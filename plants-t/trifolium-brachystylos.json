It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a short petiole. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Trifolium brachystylos is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
