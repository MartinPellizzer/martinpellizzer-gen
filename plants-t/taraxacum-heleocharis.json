It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a distinctive seed sphere. This species is typically found in wet or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Taraxacum heleocharis plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and provides nectar for various pollinators."
