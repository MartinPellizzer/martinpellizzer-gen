    "intro": "Trichoscypha brieyi, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and elliptical leaves that are alternately arranged along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an important species for both ecological and economic purposes."
