These plants are native to various regions in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. They are characterized by their tall, slender stems and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Trichelostylis species typically grow in coastal or sandy habitats, often as epiphytes or lithophytes. The flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
