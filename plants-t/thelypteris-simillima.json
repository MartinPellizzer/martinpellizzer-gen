    "intro": "Thelypteris simillima, commonly known as the similar holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are relatively short and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. Thelypteris simillima is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
