It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
