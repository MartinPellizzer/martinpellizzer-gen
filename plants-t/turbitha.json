    "intro": "Turbitha, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white, with a distinctively spiraled pattern on the petals. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in muddy substrates. Turbitha is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies. Its botanical significance extends beyond aesthetics, as it has been cultivated for centuries in traditional medicine and spiritual practices."
