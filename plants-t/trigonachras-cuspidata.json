    "intro": "Trigonachras cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its aquatic habitat."
