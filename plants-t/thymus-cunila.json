    "intro": "Thymus cunila, commonly known as narrowleaf thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves and pink to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus cunila is also noted for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
