    "intro": "Tabernaemontana cerifera, commonly known as the candlewood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that give it a candle-like appearance, hence its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring or early summer. Its ornamental value makes it popular in horticulture, though it is sensitive to cold temperatures. The plant's botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a woody stem with a distinctive, aromatic bark."
