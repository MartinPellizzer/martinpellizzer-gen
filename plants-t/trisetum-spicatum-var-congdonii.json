It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fine texture, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
