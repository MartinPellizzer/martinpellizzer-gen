    "intro": "Tectaria subdimorpha, commonly known as the golden tectaria, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
