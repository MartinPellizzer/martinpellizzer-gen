It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its long, slender, vine-like stems. The plant produces large, pale green, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit, which resembles a snake in shape, is typically harvested when it is still green and immature. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a mild, slightly bitter flavor."
