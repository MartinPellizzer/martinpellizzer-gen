    "intro": "Trillium scouleri, commonly known as the Vancouver lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features three broad, waxy, egg-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight purple tinge. The plant produces a single, nodding white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. Trillium scouleri prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in coniferous forests. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in forest ecosystems and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
