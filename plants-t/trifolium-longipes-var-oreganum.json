    "intro": "Trifolium longipes var. oreganum, commonly known as Oregon mountain clover, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
