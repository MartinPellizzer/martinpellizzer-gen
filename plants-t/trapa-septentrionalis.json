    "intro": "Trapa septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern water shield, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered with a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by distinctive spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Its roots are adapted to thrive in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Trapa septentrionalis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
