    "intro": "Thymus hyemalis subsp. millefloris, commonly known as the winter thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, small, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in colder climates, contributing to its popularity in horticultural settings."
