    "intro": "Thespesia campylosiphon, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, including Hawaii. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers are typically pink to red in color and bloom during the warm season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind or water, contributing to its natural distribution in coastal and lowland habitats."
