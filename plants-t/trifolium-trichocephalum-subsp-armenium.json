    "intro": "Trifolium trichocephalum subsp. armenium, commonly known as Armenian clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
