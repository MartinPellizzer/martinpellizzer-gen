    "intro": "Tetragompha, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring four distinct lobes on the petals, which set it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually small and pale, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Tetragompha is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
