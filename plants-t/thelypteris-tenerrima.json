    "intro": "Thelypteris tenerrima, commonly known as the fragile water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris tenerrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
