    "intro": "Trifolium modestum, commonly known as the modest clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Trifolium modestum thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in grassy areas and along pathways. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
