    "intro": "Treisteria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring long, slender leaves and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or in dense undergrowth. Treisteria is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insects for reproduction. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
