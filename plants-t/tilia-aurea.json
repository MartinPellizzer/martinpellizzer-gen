    "intro": "Tilia aurea, commonly known as the golden linden, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The golden linden is valued for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
