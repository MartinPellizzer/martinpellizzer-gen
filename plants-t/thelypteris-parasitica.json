    "intro": "Thelypteris parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic wood fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds and is often found growing on other plants, particularly in shaded, humid environments. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris parasitica plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
