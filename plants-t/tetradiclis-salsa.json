    "intro": "Tetradiclis salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources. Tetradiclis salsa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
