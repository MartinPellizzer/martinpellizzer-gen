    "intro": "Tripsacum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, which are typically greenish to brown in color. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Botanically, it is closely related to maize and teosinte, contributing to its historical significance in the development of cultivated corn."
