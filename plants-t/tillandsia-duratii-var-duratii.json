    "intro": "Tillandsia duratii var. duratii, commonly known as the Duratii air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual element. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting or soaking to maintain humidity. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
