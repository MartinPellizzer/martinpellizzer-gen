It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellowish-green spadices that emerge from a rosette of leaves, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
