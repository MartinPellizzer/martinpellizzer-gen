    "intro": "Trudelia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf trudelia, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Trudelia pumila is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
