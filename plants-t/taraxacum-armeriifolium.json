    "intro": "Taraxacum armeriifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, a common feature in the genus Taraxacum. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
