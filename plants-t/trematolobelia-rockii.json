    "intro": "Trematolobelia rockii, commonly known as the Rock's trematolobelia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a waxy texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
