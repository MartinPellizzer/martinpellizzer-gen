    "intro": "Thalictrum minus var. odoratum, commonly known as the sweet-scented meadow rue, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its fragrance is subtle but pleasant, adding a unique sensory element to its habitat."
