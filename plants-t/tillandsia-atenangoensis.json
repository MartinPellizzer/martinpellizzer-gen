    "intro": "Tillandsia atenangoensis, commonly known as the Atenango air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features dense, fibrous roots and rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
