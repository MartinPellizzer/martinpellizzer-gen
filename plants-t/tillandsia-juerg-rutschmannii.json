    "intro": "Tillandsia juerg-rutschmannii, commonly known as the R\u00fcchmann's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
