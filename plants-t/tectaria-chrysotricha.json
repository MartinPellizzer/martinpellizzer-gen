    "intro": "Tectaria chrysotricha, commonly known as the golden-haired shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive golden-brown hairy coating on the underside. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Tectaria chrysotricha is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and biodiversity."
