    "intro": "Trichospermum fosbergii, commonly known as Fosberg's trichospermum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, three-lobed capsules as its fruit. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
