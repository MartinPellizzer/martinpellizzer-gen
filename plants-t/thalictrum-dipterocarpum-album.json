    "intro": "Thalictrum dipterocarpum album, commonly known as the white-flowered meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, showy flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often slender and branched, supporting the delicate flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Thalictrum dipterocarpum album is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting biodiversity."
