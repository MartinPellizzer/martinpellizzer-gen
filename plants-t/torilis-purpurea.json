It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, purple flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by spiky, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Torilis purpurea is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields."
