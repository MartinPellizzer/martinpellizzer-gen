    "intro": "Terminalia gracilis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Terminalia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically alternate and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree in tropical landscapes."
