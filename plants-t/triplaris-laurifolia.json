    "intro": "Triplaris laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel-leaf triplaris, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests or disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
