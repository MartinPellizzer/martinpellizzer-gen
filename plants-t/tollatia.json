    "intro": "Tollatia, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plants typically have evergreen leaves that are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating. Tollatia species produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink, which bloom in late summer. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
