    "intro": "Taraxacum pawlodarskum, commonly known as the Pawlodarskum dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, bright yellow composite flower head. The plant is native to Central Asia and is typically found in dry meadows and rocky soils. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. The flowers develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind, facilitating its spread across various habitats."
