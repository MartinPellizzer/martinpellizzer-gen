    "intro": "Tillandsia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
