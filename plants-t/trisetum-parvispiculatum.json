    "intro": "Trisetum parvispiculatum, commonly known as the small-headed feathergrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, delicate foliage and slender, arching stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Trisetum parvispiculatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
