    "intro": "Thelypteris multiauriculata, commonly known as the auriculate shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, ear-like lobes along the margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the establishment of dense colonies. The fronds are usually pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
