    "intro": "Taraxacum recessum, commonly known as the Alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that produces a single, yellow composite flower head. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and has a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where it thrives in poor, well-drained soils. Taraxacum recessum is a member of the Asteraceae family, sharing the characteristic composite flowers typical of the genus."
