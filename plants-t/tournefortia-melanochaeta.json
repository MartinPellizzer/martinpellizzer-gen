    "intro": "Tournefortia melanochaeta, commonly known as the black-hair tournefortia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation in suitable habitats."
