    "intro": "Tristellateia bojeriana, commonly known as the Bojer's tristellateia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich nature. Tristellateia bojeriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
