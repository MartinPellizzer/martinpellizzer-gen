    "intro": "Trifolium fragiferum var. durandoi, commonly known as the Durando's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
