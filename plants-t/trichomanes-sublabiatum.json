    "intro": "Trichomanes sublabiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes sublabiatum is notable for its ability to survive in high humidity and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
