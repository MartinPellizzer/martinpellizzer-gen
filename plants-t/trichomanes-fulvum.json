    "intro": "Trichomanes fulvum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to orange fronds that are typically narrow and strap-like. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, which are covered in tiny, intricate structures called indusia. Trichomanes fulvum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
