    "intro": "Tetradymia axillaris, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Tetradymia axillaris is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators in its native habitat."
