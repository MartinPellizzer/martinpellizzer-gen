It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
