    "intro": "Typhalea leucantha, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. Typhalea leucantha is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants in its native habitat."
