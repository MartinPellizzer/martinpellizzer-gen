    "intro": "Terminalia trichopoda, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for timber and traditional uses."
