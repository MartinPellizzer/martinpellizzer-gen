It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, papery texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
