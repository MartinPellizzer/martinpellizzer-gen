    "intro": "Tribulus arabicus, commonly known as the desert spurred grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, yellow flowers and distinctive spines along its stems. The plant produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Tribulus arabicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
