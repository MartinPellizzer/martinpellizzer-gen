    "intro": "Triumfetta glechomoides, commonly known as slender false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often in open woodland or along streambanks. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Triumfetta glechomoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
