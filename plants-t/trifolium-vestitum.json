    "intro": "Trifolium vestitum, commonly known as the clothed clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Trifolium vestitum is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It is a nitrogen-fixing plant, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
