    "intro": "Trigonocapnos curvipes, commonly known as the zigzag bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. Trigonocapnos curvipes is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates."
