    "intro": "Tulotis, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants that belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Tulotis species are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. Their roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in the mud, while the leaves provide a surface for photosynthesis. The flowers of Tulotis play an important role in attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
