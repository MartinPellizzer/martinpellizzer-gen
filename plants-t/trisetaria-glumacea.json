    "intro": "Trisetaria glumacea, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, bearing small, two-lobed glumes. Trisetaria glumacea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
