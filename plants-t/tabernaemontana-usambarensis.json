    "intro": "Tabernaemontana usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is evergreen, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique floral traits and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
