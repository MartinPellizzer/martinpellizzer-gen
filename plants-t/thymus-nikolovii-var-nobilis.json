    "intro": "Thymus nikolovii var. nobilis, commonly known as the noble thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Bulgaria. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are densely packed and emit a strong, minty fragrance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for both garden use and traditional herbal remedies."
