    "intro": "Thamnochortus strictus, commonly known as the narrowleaf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the warmer months. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
