It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of fine, white pubescence. Thelypteris tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
