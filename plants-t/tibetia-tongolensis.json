    "intro": "Tibetia tongolensis, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, adapting to the harsh climate with its compact growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Tibetia tongolensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
