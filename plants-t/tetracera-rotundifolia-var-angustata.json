It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland forests and thrives in shaded environments. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
