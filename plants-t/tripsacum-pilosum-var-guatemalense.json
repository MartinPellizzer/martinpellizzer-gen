    "intro": "Tripsacum pilosum var. guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan wild maize, is a perennial grass native to Central America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to maize, exhibiting similar structural features. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in wetland or disturbed habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its potential as a genetic resource for maize improvement and its ecological role in native ecosystems."
