    "intro": "Thesium abietinum, commonly known as the silverweed or mountain silverweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Thesium abietinum is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
