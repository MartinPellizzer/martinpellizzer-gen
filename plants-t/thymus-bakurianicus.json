    "intro": "Thymus bakurianicus, commonly known as the Caucasian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils responsible for its strong, minty scent. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardiness and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners and botanists alike."
