    "intro": "Thelypteris scopulorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori. Thelypteris scopulorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
