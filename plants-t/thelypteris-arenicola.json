    "intro": "Thelypteris arenicola, commonly known as the sandstone fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as sandstone outcrops and woodland edges. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and its leaves are typically divided into small, rounded segments. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family. Thelypteris arenicola is an indicator species for dry, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing rocky environments."
