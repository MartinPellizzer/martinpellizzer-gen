    "intro": "Taraxacum hypopolium, commonly known as the short-haired dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves that are typically shorter than those of other dandelion species. The plant produces a hollow, hairless stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical, fluffy seed head. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its low-growing habit and unique floral structure, it is a common yet often overlooked member of the dandelion genus."
