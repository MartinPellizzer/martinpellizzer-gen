    "intro": "Tradescantia geniculata var. schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiede's spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage color and delicate floral display."
