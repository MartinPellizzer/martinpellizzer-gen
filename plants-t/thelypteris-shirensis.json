    "intro": "Thelypteris shirensis, commonly known as the Shire fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Thelypteris shirensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
