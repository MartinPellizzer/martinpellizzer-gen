    "intro": "Taraxacum languidum, commonly known as the sleepy dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a long, slender stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, aiding in its widespread distribution. The species is notable for its slow growth and dormancy during unfavorable conditions, contributing to its common name."
