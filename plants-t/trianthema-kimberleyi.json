    "intro": "Trianthema kimberleyi, commonly known as the Kimberley daisy, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
