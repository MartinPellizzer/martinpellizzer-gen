    "intro": "Thyselium palustre, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist environment. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. Thyselium palustre plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native wetland ecosystems."
