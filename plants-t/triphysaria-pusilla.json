    "intro": "Triphysaria pusilla, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its leaves are usually simple and whorled, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged. Triphysaria pusilla is a carnivorous plant, relying on the captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
