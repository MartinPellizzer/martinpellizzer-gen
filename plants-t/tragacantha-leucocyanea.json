    "intro": "Tragacantha leucocyanea, commonly known as the white tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its sap, which is rich in gum tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments."
