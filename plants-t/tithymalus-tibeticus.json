    "intro": "Tithymalus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan tithymalus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, arid conditions of its native habitat. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its region."
