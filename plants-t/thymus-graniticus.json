    "intro": "Thymus graniticus, commonly known as the granitic thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is often used in herbal medicine for its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Thymus graniticus is also valued in culinary applications for its distinctive, pungent flavor."
