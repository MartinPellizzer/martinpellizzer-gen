    "intro": "Thelymitra psammophila, commonly known as the sand lily, is a terrestrial orchid native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers per stem. Thelymitra psammophila is an important component of the local flora and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands."
