    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. leiodontus, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in dense clusters, often blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, give it a strong, spicy aroma and make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
