It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, edible leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves contain high levels of nutrients, making it a valuable plant for both human consumption and livestock feed. Tetragonia robusta var. robusta is also noted for its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments, contributing to its ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
