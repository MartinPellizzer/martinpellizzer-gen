    "intro": "Tetrapterys multiglandulosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The leaves are typically green with a slightly pubescent surface, and they have a distinctive glandular structure that contributes to its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is native to the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Tetrapterys multiglandulosa is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
