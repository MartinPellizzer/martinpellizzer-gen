    "intro": "Thymus jankae var. laniger, commonly known as the woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice among horticulturists and garden enthusiasts."
