    "intro": "Teramnus hedysaroides, commonly known as the mountain peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Teramnus hedysaroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
