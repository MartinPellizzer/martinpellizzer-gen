    "intro": "Trifolium armenium, commonly known as Armenian clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates, making it a hardy perennial in suitable environments. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
