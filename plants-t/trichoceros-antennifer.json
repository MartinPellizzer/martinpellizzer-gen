    "intro": "Trichoceros antennifer, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers with a star-like pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
