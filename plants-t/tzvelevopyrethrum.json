    "intro": "Tzvelevopyrethrum, commonly known as the goldenroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that stores essential oils, contributing to its medicinal properties. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, conical clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. Tzvelevopyrethrum is valued for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory compounds, often used in traditional medicine."
