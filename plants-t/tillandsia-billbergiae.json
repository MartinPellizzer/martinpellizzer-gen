    "intro": "Tillandsia billbergiae, commonly known as the silver vase bromeliad, is a species of air plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps it absorb moisture from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer."
