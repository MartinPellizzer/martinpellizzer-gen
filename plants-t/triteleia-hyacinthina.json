    "intro": "Triteleia hyacinthina, commonly known as the blue owl's eye, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that resemble the eyes of an owl, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped blooms in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Triteleia hyacinthina is also valued for its ability to naturalize and return year after year in suitable climates."
