    "intro": "Trifolium atrorubens, commonly known as the black-red clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, purple to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Trifolium atrorubens is valued for its role in soil nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
