    "intro": "Triticum durum var. ramoso-obscurum, commonly known as the dark branched durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its dark-colored, branched glumes. It is primarily cultivated for its high gluten content, which makes it ideal for semolina production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. Its dark pigmentation is due to the accumulation of phenolic compounds, which contribute to its unique appearance and potential nutritional properties. This variety is often studied for its role in traditional agriculture and its adaptability to various climatic conditions."
