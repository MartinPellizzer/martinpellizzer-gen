    "intro": "Tillandsia hoepfelii, commonly known as the Hoepfeli air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to Brazil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and does not require soil for growth, relying instead on its leaves to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant features rosettes of narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
