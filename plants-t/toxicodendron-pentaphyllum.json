It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries. Its sap contains urushiol, a toxic compound that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides."
