    "intro": "Tectaria bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, specialized structures called sorus."
