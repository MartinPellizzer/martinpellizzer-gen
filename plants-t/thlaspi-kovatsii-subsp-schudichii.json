    "intro": "Thlaspi kovatsii subsp. schudichii, commonly known as the Schudich's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually basal, with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
