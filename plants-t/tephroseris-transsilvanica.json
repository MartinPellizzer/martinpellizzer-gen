    "intro": "Tephroseris transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian tephroseris, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinctive pubescent surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
