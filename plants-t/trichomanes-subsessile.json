    "intro": "Trichomanes subsessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes subsessile is notable for its intricate leaf venation and its ability to retain moisture in its compact, low-growing form."
