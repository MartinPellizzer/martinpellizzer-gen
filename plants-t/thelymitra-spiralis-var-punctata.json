    "intro": "Thelymitra spiralis var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The flower spike bears several pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with distinctive dark red or purple spots. The species is known for its ability to form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. It is a protected species in some regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
