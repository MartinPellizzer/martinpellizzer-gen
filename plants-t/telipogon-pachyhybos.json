    "intro": "Telipogon pachyhybos, commonly known as the thick-horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring elongated, club-shaped sepals and petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or montane regions. Its reproductive strategy relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Telipogon pachyhybos is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
