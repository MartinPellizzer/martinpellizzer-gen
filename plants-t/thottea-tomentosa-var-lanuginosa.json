    "intro": "Thottea tomentosa var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly thottea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features soft, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
