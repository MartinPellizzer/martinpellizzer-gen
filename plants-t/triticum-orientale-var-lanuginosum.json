    "intro": "Triticum orientale var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the silky wheat, is a botanical variety characterized by its soft, hairy glumes and lemma. It is a diploid species belonging to the grass family Poaceae, native to Central Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, and it produces a distinctive, pale yellow to golden grain. This variety is primarily of interest for its historical and genetic significance in wheat domestication studies."
