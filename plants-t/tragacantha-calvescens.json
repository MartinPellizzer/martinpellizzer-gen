It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, globular seed pods. One of its most notable features is the production of a sticky, resinous sap, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. This species is well adapted to dry environments, showcasing deep root systems and drought tolerance."
