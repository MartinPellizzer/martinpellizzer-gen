    "intro": "Talipulia, commonly known as the water lily of the genus *Nymphaea*, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, while the stems float on the surface. Talipulia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
