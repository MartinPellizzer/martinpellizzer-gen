    "intro": "Thalictrum semiscandens, commonly known as the creeping meadow-rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Thalictrum semiscandens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
