    "intro": "Trifolium arvense subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender field clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
