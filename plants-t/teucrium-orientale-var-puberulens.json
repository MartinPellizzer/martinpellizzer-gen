    "intro": "Teucrium orientale var. puberulens, commonly known as the smooth germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a grayish-green hue due to their pubescent surface. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and bloom in the summer months. The plant is known for its aromatic leaves and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
