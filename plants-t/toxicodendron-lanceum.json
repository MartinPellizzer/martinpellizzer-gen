    "intro": "Toxicodendron lanceum, commonly known as the Chinese lacquer tree, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe. It is valued for its ability to produce a durable resin used in traditional crafts and lacquerware. However, it contains urushiol, a toxic compound that can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
