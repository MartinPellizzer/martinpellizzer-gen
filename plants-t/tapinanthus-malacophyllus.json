    "intro": "Tapinanthus malacophyllus, commonly known as the African dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Africa, where it typically infests various shrubs and trees. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly branched, vine-like structure that allows it to attach to its host. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host plants."
