    "intro": "Triumfetta grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower false mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, blooming from summer to autumn. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Triumfetta grandiflora is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
