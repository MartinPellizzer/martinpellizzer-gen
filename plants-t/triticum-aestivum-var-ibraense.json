    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. ibraense, commonly known as the Ibraens wheat, is a variant of bread wheat native to the highlands of Ethiopia. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptation to high-altitude environments. It typically exhibits shorter stature and higher resistance to drought compared to other wheat varieties. The plant produces spikelets that are often more compact, contributing to its unique morphology. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying adaptation strategies in marginal agricultural zones."
