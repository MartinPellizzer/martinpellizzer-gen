    "intro": "Tupa linearifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf tupa, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Tupa linearifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
