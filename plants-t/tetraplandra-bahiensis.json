    "intro": "Tetraplandra bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia tetraploid, is a rare flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is a tetraploid, meaning it has four sets of chromosomes, which is unusual for its genus. It typically grows in sandy soils in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
