It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pinnae arrangement. Thelypteris gracilenta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or swampy areas."
