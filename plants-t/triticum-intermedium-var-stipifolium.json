    "intro": "Triticum intermedium var. stipifolium, commonly known as the slenderleaf intermediate wheat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and compact inflorescence, which typically consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. The plant produces small, two-lobed florets that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a cover crop."
