    "intro": "Triticum vulgare convar. spelta, commonly known as spelt, is an ancient grain with distinctive botanical features. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its hollow stems and spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, two-lobed glumes that enclose the florets, which eventually develop into awned grains. Spelt grains are typically longer and more slender compared to modern wheat varieties. Its genetic makeup includes a mix of wild and domesticated traits, contributing to its unique nutritional profile and resilience to environmental stress."
