    "intro": "Tetraneuris herbacea, commonly known as the hairy tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its woolly, gray-green foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Tetraneuris herbacea is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
