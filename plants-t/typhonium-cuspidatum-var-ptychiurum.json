The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy areas or near water bodies. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage."
