It is characterized by its hairy stems and deeply lobed, often jagged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its botanical features make it a notable species in Mediterranean flora and a subject of interest in botanic gardens."
