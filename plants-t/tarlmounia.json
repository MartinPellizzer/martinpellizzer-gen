    "intro": "Tarlmounia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tarlmounia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
