    "intro": "Taeniophyllum affine, commonly known as the small-leaved tailed orchid, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives on the forest floor or on trees. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The orchid's floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
