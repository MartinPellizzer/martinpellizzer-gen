    "intro": "Thelypteris longisora, commonly known as the long-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris longisora is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
