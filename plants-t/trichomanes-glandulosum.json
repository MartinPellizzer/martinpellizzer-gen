It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes glandulosum is known for its ability to thrive in high humidity and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
