    "intro": "Tillandsia commelyna, commonly known as the silver vase, is an epiphytic bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth form with narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine trichomes. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Tillandsia commelyna is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities."
