    "intro": "Tilia \u00d7 populifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf linden, is a hybrid deciduous tree that combines characteristics of both Tilia and Populus species. It is native to Europe and is known for its heart-shaped, large, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces fragrant, creamy-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in urban landscapes for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
