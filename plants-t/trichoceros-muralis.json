The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Trichoceros muralis is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover unsightly surfaces and its low maintenance requirements."
