    "intro": "Taraxacum scotinum, commonly known as the Scottish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafy stem. The plant produces a bright yellow flower head that develops into a spherical seed ball with feathery seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Taraxacum scotinum is noted for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its purported health benefits."
