It is a perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. The plant has a distinctive globular shape, with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are typically covered in a fine, whitish coating. Tarachia wilfordii is well adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
