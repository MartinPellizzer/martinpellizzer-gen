    "intro": "Tetranthera amara, commonly known as the bitter tetranthera, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a slightly rough texture, while the plant produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Tetranthera amara is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific research on its properties remains limited."
