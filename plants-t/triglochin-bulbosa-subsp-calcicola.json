    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola triglochin, is a perennial herb native to calcareous soils in Europe. It typically grows in moist, alkaline environments such as wet meadows and saline marshes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas. It is adapted to withstand saline and waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic species of coastal and inland wetlands."
