    "intro": "Trifolium \u00d7 jankae, commonly known as the hybrid white clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, typically consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives best in well-drained, fertile soils. It is often used in agricultural settings for forage and soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Trifolium \u00d7 jankae is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
