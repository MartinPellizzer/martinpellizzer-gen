    "intro": "Tupistra thangii, commonly known as the Thangri stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing on cliffs or slopes. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
