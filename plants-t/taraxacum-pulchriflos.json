    "intro": "Taraxacum pulchriflos, commonly known as the beautiful dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which develop into the familiar white, fluffy seed heads. This species is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils across its native range."
