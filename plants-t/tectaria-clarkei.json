    "intro": "Tectaria clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's tectaria, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Tectaria clarkei is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, showcasing its adaptability to diverse ecological niches."
