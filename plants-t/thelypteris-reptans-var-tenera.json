    "intro": "Thelypteris reptans var. tenera, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern with a compact, creeping growth habit, featuring rhizomatous stems that produce dense clusters of fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided, glossy, and often dark green leaflets. This variety is distinguished by its softer, more leathery texture compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks."
