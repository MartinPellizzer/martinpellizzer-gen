    "intro": "Trichoglottis kenchungianum, commonly known as the Kenchung orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
