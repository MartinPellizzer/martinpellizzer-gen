    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. amiantinus, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in herbal medicine."
