    "intro": "Tripodanthera, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Andes mountains. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while the fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature."
