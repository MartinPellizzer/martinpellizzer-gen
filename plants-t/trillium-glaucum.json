    "intro": "Trillium glaucum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in rich, moist woodlands and thrives in partial shade. The plant features three broad, waxy white petals and three sepals that are often a lighter green or white in color. Its leaves are three-parted and lance-shaped, emerging from a single stem. Trillium glaucum produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower, which develops into a red or orange berry containing several seeds."
