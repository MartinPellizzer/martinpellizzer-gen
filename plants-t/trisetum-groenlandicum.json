    "intro": "Trisetum groenlandicum, commonly known as Greenland sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-light conditions. Trisetum groenlandicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
