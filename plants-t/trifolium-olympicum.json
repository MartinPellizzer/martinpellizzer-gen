    "intro": "Trifolium olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic clover, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
