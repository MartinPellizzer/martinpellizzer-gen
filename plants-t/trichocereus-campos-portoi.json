    "intro": "Trichocereus campos-portoi, commonly known as the San Pedro cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in the spring. Its stems are covered in spines and have a ribbed structure typical of many cacti. Trichocereus campos-portoi is also notable for containing psychoactive alkaloids, such as mescaline, which have been used in traditional and ceremonial contexts."
