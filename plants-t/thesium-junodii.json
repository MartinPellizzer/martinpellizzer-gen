    "intro": "Thesium junodii, commonly known as the Cape York thesium, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Thesium junodii is often found in coastal areas and is a component of the local flora in Queensland and the Northern Territory."
