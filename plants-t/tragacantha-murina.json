    "intro": "Tragacantha murina, commonly known as the rock tragacanth, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody base and fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its latex-rich sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum. Tragacantha murina thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
