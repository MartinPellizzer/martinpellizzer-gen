    "intro": "Tectaria siifolia, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a complex venation pattern. Tectaria siifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
