    "intro": "Taraxacum longisquameum, commonly known as the long-scaled dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in long, stiff bristles. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy, wind-dispersed seed head. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and easily identifiable member of the dandelion genus."
