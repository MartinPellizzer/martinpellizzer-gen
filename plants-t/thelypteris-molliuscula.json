    "intro": "Thelypteris molliuscula, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris molliuscula is well adapted to acidic soils and can thrive in areas with limited sunlight."
