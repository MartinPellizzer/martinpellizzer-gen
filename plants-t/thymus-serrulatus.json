It features small, narrow leaves with serrated edges and produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early summer. The plant is closely related to other members of the Lamiaceae family, known for their aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. Its fragrant foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for both culinary and horticultural use."
