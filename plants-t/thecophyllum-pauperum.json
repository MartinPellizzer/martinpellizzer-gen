    "intro": "Thecophyllum pauperum, commonly known as the poor man's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately divided leaves that form a dense, shield-like structure, which helps protect it from environmental stressors. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Thecophyllum pauperum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
