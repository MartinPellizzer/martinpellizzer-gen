    "intro": "Taraxacum huterianum, commonly known as the Huterian dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white parachute-like seeds. Native to Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is a perennial herb that produces a latex-like sap when the stems or leaves are damaged. The plant is adapted to harsh environments and has a relatively small geographic distribution."
