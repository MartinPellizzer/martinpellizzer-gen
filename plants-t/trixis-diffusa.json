    "intro": "Trixis diffusa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a distinctive lobed shape, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Trixis diffusa is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive with minimal water."
