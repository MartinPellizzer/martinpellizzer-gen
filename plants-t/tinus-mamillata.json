    "intro": "Tinus mamillata, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are a notable feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. The leaves contain a milky sap, which gives the plant its common name and has been used in traditional medicine."
