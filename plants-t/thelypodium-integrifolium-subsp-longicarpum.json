    "intro": "Thelypodium integrifolium subsp. longicarpum, commonly known as the long-seeded thelypodium, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, cylindrical fruits, which are covered in fine hairs."
