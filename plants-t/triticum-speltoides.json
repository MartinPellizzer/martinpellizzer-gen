    "intro": "Triticum speltoides, commonly known as wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It is closely related to domesticated wheat and has small, awned spikelets that produce tiny grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow leaves. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces a hard, inedible seed coat around its grains. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving modern wheat varieties."
