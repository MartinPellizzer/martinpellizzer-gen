    "intro": "Thelypteris prismatica, commonly known as the prism fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Thelypteris prismatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
