    "intro": "Taraxacum argillicola, commonly known as the clay dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces a yellow composite flower that develops into a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds. It thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
