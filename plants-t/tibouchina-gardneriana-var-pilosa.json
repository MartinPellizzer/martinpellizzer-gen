It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, with a fuzzy surface due to the presence of fine, white hairs. It produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique foliage and attractive floral display."
