It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
