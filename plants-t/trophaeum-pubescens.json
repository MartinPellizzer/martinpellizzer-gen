    "intro": "Trophaeum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green stems and small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and nutrient cycling."
