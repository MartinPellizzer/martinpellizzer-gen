    "intro": "Tradescantia reflexa f. lesteri, commonly known as the silver spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver-gray hue on the upper surface and a darker green underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
