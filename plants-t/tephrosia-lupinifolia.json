    "intro": "Tephrosia lupinifolia, commonly known as the lupin-like tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and arid environments. Tephrosia lupinifolia is also noted for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in soil enrichment and agroforestry practices."
