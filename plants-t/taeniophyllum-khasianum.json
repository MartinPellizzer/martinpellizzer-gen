    "intro": "Taeniophyllum khasianum, commonly known as the Khasi moss or Khasi liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures called thallus, which are usually green and photosynthetic. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Taeniophyllum khasianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
