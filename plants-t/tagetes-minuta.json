    "intro": "Tagetes minuta, commonly known as Mexican marigold or dwarf marigold, is an annual herb native to Central America. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow or orange flowers and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant is often grown as a companion plant due to its ability to repel certain pests. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Its aromatic foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental and medicinal purposes."
