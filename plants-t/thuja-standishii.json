    "intro": "Thuja standishii, commonly known as the Japanese white cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan.

The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Thuja standishii prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of landscaping applications.
