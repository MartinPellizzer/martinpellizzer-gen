    "intro": "Thamnopteris musifolia, commonly known as the musical fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which is believed to attract nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of both scientific interest and ecological significance."
