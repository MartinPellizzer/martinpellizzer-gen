    "intro": "Taraxacum acre, commonly known as the Mexican dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the characteristic seed heads that release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Taraxacum acre is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
