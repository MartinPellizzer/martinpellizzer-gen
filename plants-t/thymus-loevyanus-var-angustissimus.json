It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its pungent, peppery aroma. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
