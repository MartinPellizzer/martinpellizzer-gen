    "intro": "Tragacantha johannis, commonly known as the Johann's tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces a gum-like substance from its bark, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
