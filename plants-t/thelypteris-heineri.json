    "intro": "Thelypteris heineri, commonly known as the Heiner's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Thelypteris heineri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
