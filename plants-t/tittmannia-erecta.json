It is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in loose umbels, and bloom in late spring. Tittmannia erecta is often found in association with other woodland flora and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
