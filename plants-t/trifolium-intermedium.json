    "intro": "Trifolium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on either side of a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Trifolium intermedium is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
