    "intro": "Trifolium tomentosum subsp. macrosphaerum, commonly known as the woolly clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its trifoliate leaves, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, are often covered with a thick layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to grow in moist, often shaded environments, such as woodland floors and meadows."
