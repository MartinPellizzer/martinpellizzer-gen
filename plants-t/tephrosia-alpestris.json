    "intro": "Tephrosia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine tephrosia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils, making it resilient to drought conditions. Tephrosia alpestris is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
