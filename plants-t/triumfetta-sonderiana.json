    "intro": "Triumfetta sonderiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions contribute to its ecological impact."
