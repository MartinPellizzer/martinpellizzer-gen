    "intro": "Tinnea barbata, commonly known as the bearded willow, is a small shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Tinnea barbata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early bloom."
