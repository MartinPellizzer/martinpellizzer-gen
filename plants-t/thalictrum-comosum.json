It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spherical shape, giving it the species name \"comosum.\" It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Its delicate appearance and early spring bloom make it a notable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
