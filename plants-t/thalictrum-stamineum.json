It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thalictrum stamineum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
