    "intro": "Tetrapterys poeppigiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
