    "intro": "Trichomanes opacum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Trichomanes opacum is considered a species of conservation concern."
