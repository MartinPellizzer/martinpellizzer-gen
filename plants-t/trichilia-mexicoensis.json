    "intro": "Trichilia mexicoensis, commonly known as Mexican trichilia, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in axillary clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall. The species is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
