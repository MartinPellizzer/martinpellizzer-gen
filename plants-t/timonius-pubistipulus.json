    "intro": "Timonius pubistipulus, commonly known as the silver-tipped fern, is a unique vascular plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features prominently pubescent (hairy) stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. The silver-tipped fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
