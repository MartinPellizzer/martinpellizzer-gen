It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Thalictrum tripeltiferum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and early spring bloom."
