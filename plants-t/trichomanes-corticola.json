    "intro": "Trichomanes corticola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or tree bark, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from its surroundings. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes corticola thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
