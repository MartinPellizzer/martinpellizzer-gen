    "intro": "Trifolium longipes f. caurinum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clover, is a botanical variant of the common clover species. It is characterized by its elongated stems and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. This subspecies typically grows in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, forming small clusters that attract pollinators. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
