    "intro": "Typha angustata var. leptocarpa, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower spikes. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant produces brown, cylindrical flower heads that contain numerous small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. It is also used in traditional practices and can be a source of material for basket-making."
