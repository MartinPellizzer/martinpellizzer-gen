    "intro": "Triticum polonicum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as Polish wheat or grandiflorous wheat, is a botanical variety native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, robust growth habit and large, showy florets that make it visually striking. The plant typically grows to heights of 1.5 to 2 meters, with long, slender leaves and a bushy inflorescence. It produces hardy, straw-colored grains that are primarily used for forage and soil conservation rather than human consumption. This variety is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in ecological restoration projects."
