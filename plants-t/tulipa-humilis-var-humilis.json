    "intro": "Tulipa humilis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows to a height of only 10\u201320 centimeters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or small spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its compact size and vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
