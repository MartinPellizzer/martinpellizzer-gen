    "intro": "Tragacantha macrostachys, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces a sticky resin, known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a thickening agent. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy surface, adapting to the dry climate. Tragacantha macrostachys thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
