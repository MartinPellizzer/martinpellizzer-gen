    "intro": "Trichelostylis borealis, commonly known as the northern trichelostylis, is a rare and endemic fern found in the temperate rainforests of southern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
