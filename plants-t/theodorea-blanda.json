    "intro": "Theodorea blanda, commonly known as the softleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock surfaces. Theodorea blanda is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
