    "intro": "Taraxacum lippertianum, commonly known as the Lippert's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous small, ray florets that open in the spring and summer months. It produces a distinctive, elongated seed head with parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
