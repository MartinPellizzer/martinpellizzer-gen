    "intro": "Tulipa riparia var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow river tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the wet meadows of the European river valleys. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically orange to yellow in color, with a distinctive red or purple streak along the outer edge. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are relatively small and often form clumps over time, making it a desirable choice for wetland gardens. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
