    "intro": "Thalictrum angustifolium subsp. jacquinianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are arranged in upright, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
