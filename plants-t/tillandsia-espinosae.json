    "intro": "Tillandsia espinosae, commonly known as the Espinoza air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
