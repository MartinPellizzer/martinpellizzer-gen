    "intro": "Tragopogon subalpinus, commonly known as alpine goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces yellow ray flowers and a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tragopogon subalpinus is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations."
