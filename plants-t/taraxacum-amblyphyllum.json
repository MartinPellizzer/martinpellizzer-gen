    "intro": "Taraxacum amblyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a flowering head that produces a cluster of tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and early summer, contributing to its ecological role as a source of nectar for pollinators."
