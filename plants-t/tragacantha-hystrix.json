    "intro": "Tragacantha hystrix, commonly known as the curly tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, spiny, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots are known for producing a viscous gum, which has been used historically in medicine and as a thickening agent. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
