It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and lance-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or whitish underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Tradescantia hypophaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily through rhizomes."
