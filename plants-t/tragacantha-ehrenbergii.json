    "intro": "Tragacantha ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Tragacantha ehrenbergii is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
