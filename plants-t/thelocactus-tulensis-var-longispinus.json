    "intro": "Thelocactus tulensis var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined tulip cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers that resemble tulips, hence its common name. The plant features long, sharp spines that provide protection from herbivores and help reduce water loss by shading the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in harsh desert conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in arid gardens and collections."
