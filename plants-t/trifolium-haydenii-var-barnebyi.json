    "intro": "Trifolium haydenii var. barnebyi, commonly known as the Barneby's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and modest blooms."
