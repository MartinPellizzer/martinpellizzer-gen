    "intro": "Tragacantha gladiata, commonly known as the swordleaf tragacanth, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots are rich in a viscous gum, which has been historically used in medicine and as a natural adhesive. Tragacantha gladiata is often found in rocky or arid soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
