It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host tree if left unchecked."
