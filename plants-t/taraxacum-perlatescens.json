    "intro": "Taraxacum perlatescens, commonly known as the pearlleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its unique feature is the presence of small, white, bead-like structures on the leaves, which give it its common name. It is often found in meadows and woodland edges, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
