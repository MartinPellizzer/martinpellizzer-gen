    "intro": "Tillandsia carnosa var. brevistipitata, commonly known as the short-stemmed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that can store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique ability to grow without soil."
