    "intro": "Tamonea ligustroides, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Tamonea ligustroides is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. It has a fibrous root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions."
