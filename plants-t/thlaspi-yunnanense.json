It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of mustard and cabbages. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine regions. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal and have a slightly hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment."
