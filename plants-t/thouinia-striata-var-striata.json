It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions and requires minimal water once established. This variety is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
