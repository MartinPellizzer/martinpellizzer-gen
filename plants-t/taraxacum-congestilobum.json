    "intro": "Taraxacum congestilobum, commonly known as the clustered dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a crown of white pappus. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. The plant produces a large number of small seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its botanical features make it a common and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
