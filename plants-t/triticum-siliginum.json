    "intro": "Triticum siliginum, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact, spike-like arrangement of flowers. Triticum siliginum is primarily of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting insect populations and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
