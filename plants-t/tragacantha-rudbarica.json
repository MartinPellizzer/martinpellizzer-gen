    "intro": "Tragacantha rudbarica, commonly known as Persian tragacanth, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing small, brown seeds. It is valued for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects. Additionally, its gum, known as tragacanth, has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent in food and pharmaceuticals."
