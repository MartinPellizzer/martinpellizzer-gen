    "intro": "Tillandsia insularis var. latilamina, commonly known as the Florida air plant, is a bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are dense and covered in a fine, white trichome layer, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
