    "intro": "Trigonella calliceras, commonly known as the hairy trigonella, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy or pubescent, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East, it is adapted to drought conditions. Trigonella calliceras is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
