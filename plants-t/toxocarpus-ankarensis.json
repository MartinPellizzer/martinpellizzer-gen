    "intro": "Toxocarpus ankarensis, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its native range."
