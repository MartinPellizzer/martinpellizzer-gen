    "intro": "Trichomanes rigidum var. annobonense, commonly known as the Annobonense clubmoss, is a rare and specialized fern-like plant native to the island of Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Huperoniaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky substrates. Its morphology reflects adaptations to a humid tropical climate, with compact growth habits that help conserve moisture. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited ecological and botanical significance."
