    "intro": "Trifolium tridentatum var. scabrellum, commonly known as the rough leaved trefoil, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a rough texture, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
