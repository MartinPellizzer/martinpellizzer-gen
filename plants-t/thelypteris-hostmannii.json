    "intro": "Thelypteris hostmannii, commonly known as the Hostmann's holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are divided into narrow segments, and the sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the leaves. Thelypteris hostmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense, foliage."
