    "intro": "Thelypteris attenuata, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize soil. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with the lower fronds often being shorter and more compact."
