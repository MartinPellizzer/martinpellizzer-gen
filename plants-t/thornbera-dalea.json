    "intro": "Thornbera dalea, commonly known as the dwarf thornbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Thornbera dalea is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from underground sources. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
