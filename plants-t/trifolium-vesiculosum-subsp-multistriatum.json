    "intro": "Trifolium vesiculosum subsp. multistriatum, commonly known as the pink trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pink or red in color, and its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely striated leaflets and slightly smaller flowers compared to other members of the Trifolium genus."
