    "intro": "Tillandsia pectinata, commonly known as the velvet leaf tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures that help it absorb moisture from the air. This species is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
