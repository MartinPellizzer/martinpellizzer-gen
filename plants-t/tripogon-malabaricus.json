    "intro": "Tripogon malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
