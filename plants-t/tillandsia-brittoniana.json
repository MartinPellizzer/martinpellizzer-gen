    "intro": "Tillandsia brittoniana, commonly known as the Britton's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture from the air. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. This unique plant is well adapted to its natural habitat and requires minimal direct sunlight and regular misting to flourish."
