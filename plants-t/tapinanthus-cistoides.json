    "intro": "Tapinanthus cistoides, commonly known as the parasitic milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other plants to obtain water and nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, fleshy, leafless stem. It is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth of its host plants."
