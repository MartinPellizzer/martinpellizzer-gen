    "intro": "Tonduzia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered tonduzia, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces large, showy umbellate inflorescences with white or pale pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. However, it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging plant for novice growers."
