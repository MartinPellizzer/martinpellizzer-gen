    "intro": "Trifolium trichopterum var. pirinicum, commonly known as the Pirin clover, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Pirin Mountains in Bulgaria. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and have a distinctively hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
