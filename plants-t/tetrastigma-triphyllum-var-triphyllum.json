    "intro": "Tetrastigma triphyllum var. triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaf grapevine, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to clusters of edible berries. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Botanically, it belongs to the Vitaceae family and is closely related to other grapevines."
