It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
