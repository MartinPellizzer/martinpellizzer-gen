    "intro": "Tetraria compar, commonly known as the silver-spined lichen, is a foliose lichen characterized by its distinctive, flattened thallus with a white or silver-colored margin. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal forest regions. The plant's structure consists of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which provides it with nutrients. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a subject of interest in ecological and botanical studies. The species is often used as an indicator of environmental health due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
