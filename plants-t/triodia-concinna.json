    "intro": "Triodia concinna, commonly known as the spinifex grass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry growth habit and the presence of sharp, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soils, making it a common component of mallee and spinifex grasslands. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, and it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna. Triodia concinna is also valued for its use in traditional Aboriginal practices and as a component of ecological restoration projects."
