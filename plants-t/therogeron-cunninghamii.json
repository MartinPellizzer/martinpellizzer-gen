    "intro": "Therogeron cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's rockheath, is a perennial herb native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
