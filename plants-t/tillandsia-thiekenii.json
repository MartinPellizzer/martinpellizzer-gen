    "intro": "Tillandsia thiekenii, commonly known as the Tenerife air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the Canary Islands. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, which helps it collect moisture from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to coastal climates. Tillandsia thiekenii is known for its ability to survive in low-nutrient conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
