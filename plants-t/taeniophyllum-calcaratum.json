    "intro": "Taeniophyllum calcaratum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself to its substrate. Taeniophyllum calcaratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
