    "intro": "Terminalia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan Terminalia, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It is often found in lowland and hill forest areas, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
