    "intro": "Trimorpha \u00d7 helvetica, commonly known as the Swiss bellflower, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Trimorpha alpina and Trimorpha helvetica. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. The plant features showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
