    "intro": "Trichomanes roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tepuis of South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in the cool, moist microclimates of high-altitude rock formations, where it forms dense, carpet-like colonies. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Trichomanes roraimense is considered a vulnerable species."
