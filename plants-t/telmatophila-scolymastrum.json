    "intro": "Telmatophila scolymastrum, commonly known as the marsh milkweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in wetland environments, contributing to ecological balance. Telmatophila scolymastrum is also a valuable food source for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
