    "intro": "Toxicodendron integrifolium, commonly known as the itch-leaf or poison ivy, is a flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often notched leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and is known for its highly allergenic sap, which can cause a severe skin rash in sensitive individuals. It is native to much of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and forested areas."
