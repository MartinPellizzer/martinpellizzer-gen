    "intro": "Tilia argentea f. subglobularis, commonly known as the silver-leafed lime or globular linden, is a cultivar of the common linden tree. It is characterized by its rounded, compact growth habit and broad, silvery-white leaves that provide a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for ornamental landscaping due to its unique appearance. This cultivar is often used in gardens for its aesthetic value and mild air-purifying properties."
