    "intro": "Thapsia villosa subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser thapsia, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of grayish-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowering stems rise above the leaves, bearing clusters of small, yellowish flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
