    "intro": "Thysanosoria dimorphophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a free-floating and a submerged phase. Its fronds are composed of numerous small, finger-like leaves called pinnae. This species is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
