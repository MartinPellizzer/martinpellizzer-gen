It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and a hairy stem that bears a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, hollow, wind-dispersed seed stalk known as a pappus. It thrives in temperate regions and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
