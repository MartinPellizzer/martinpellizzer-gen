    "intro": "Tormentilla alpina, commonly known as alpine tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Tormentilla alpina is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
