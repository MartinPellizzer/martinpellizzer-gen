    "intro": "Tschudya pulverulenta, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Tschudya pulverulenta is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
