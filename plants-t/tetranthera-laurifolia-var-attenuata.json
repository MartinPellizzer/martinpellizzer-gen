It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
