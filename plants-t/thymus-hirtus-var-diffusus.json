    "intro": "Thymus hirtus var. diffusus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, small, oval leaves covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive texture and scent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice in both garden and herbal applications."
