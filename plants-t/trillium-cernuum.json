    "intro": "Trillium cernuum, commonly known as the nodding trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features three broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the base of the plant. The plant produces a single, downward-facing flower with three petals and three sepals, which are usually white or pale green. It blooms in early spring and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient exchange. Trillium cernuum is an important component of forest understory ecosystems."
