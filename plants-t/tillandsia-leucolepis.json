    "intro": "Tillandsia leucolepis, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of white trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and regular misting to thrive."
