    "intro": "Trigonella xeromorpha, commonly known as the desert fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are encased in a hard, dry fruit, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Trigonella xeromorpha is known for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
