    "intro": "Tanacetum integrifolium, commonly known as the European tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, often bitter scent. Tanacetum integrifolium has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiparasitic properties."
