    "intro": "Thouinia pulverulenta, commonly known as the dustflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fine, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, drought-tolerant plants."
