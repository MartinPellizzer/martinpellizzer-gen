    "intro": "Taraxacum austriacum var. punctatum, commonly known as the Austrian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The flower head produces a composite structure of numerous tiny florets, which develop into a distinctive, spherical seed head with bristly pappus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This variety is distinguished by its finely dotted leaves and is native to central Europe."
