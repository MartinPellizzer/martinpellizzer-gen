    "intro": "Toxicodendron trichocarpum f. viride, commonly known as the green-fruited sumac, is a variant of the staghorn sumac native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems and green, lobed leaves that are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into clusters of green, fleshy fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. However, it can cause skin irritation due to the presence of urushiol, a toxic resin found in its leaves and stems."
