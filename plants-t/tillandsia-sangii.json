    "intro": "Tillandsia sangii, commonly known as the silver leaf air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Tillandsia sangii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires regular misting to maintain humidity. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
