    "intro": "Thelypteris muluensis, commonly known as the Mulu holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine in some regions, highlighting its cultural and ecological significance."
