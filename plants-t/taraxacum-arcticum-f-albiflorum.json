    "intro": "Taraxacum arcticum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the Arctic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to cold climates in the Arctic and alpine regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports the flower head, which consists of many small florets. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its white-flowered form distinguishes it from other dandelion species, making it a unique botanical specimen in its habitat."
