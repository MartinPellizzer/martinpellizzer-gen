    "intro": "Tephrocactus rarissimus, commonly known as the rarest cactus in the world, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to a very limited area in the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico, where it grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its short, columnar stem and sparse, spiny areoles. Due to its extreme rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered one of the most endangered cacti. Conservation efforts are critical to its survival, as it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
