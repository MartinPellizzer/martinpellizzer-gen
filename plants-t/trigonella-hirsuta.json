    "intro": "Trigonella hirsuta, commonly known as hairy fenugreek, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a distinct, slightly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into slender, twisted pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Trigonella hirsuta is valued for its seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice in some cuisines."
