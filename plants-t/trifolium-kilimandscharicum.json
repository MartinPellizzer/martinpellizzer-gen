    "intro": "Trifolium kilimandscharicum, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro clover, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, mountainous climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
