    "intro": "Taraxacum roseocarpum, commonly known as the rose-hued dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Its scientific name refers to the rose-colored seeds that mature in late summer, distinguishing it from other dandelion species. This perennial plant is often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas, thriving in temperate climates."
