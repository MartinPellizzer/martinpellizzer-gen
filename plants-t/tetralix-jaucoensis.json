    "intro": "Tetralix jaucoensis, commonly known as the Jauco shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ability to thrive in saline and arid conditions. Tetralix jaucoensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
