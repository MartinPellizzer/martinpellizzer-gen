    "intro": "Taraxacum idiolepium, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds with parachute-like structures, typical of the genus Taraxacum. It is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
