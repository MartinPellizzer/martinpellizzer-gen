    "intro": "Teucrium chamaedrys var. multinodum, commonly known as the creeping germander, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
