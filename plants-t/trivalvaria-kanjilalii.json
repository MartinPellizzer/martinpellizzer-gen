    "intro": "Trivalvaria kanjilalii, commonly known as the Kanjilal's trivalvaria, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, trifoliate leaves that are typically clustered at the base. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and its role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
