    "intro": "Triticum velutinum, commonly known as silky wheat, is a wild grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs on the leaf blades and stems, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. It has small, spike-like inflorescences with\u9896\u7247 (lemma and palea) that are often covered in soft, silky hairs. Triticum velutinum is primarily of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential as a forage plant."
