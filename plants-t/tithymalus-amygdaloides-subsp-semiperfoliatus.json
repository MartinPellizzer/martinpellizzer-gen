    "intro": "Tithymalus amygdaloides subsp. semiperfoliatus, commonly known as the fragrant sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often semi-perfoliate, meaning they partially encircle the stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular florets surrounding ray florets, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes."
