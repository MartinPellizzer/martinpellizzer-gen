    "intro": "Torilis chlorocarpa, commonly known as the yellow hedge mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. The seeds are small, winged, and dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions."
