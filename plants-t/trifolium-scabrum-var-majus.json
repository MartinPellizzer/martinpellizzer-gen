It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges. Trifolium scabrum var. majus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
