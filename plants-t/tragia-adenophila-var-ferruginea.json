    "intro": "Tragia adenophila var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty tragia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and savannas. The plant is characterized by its glandular hairs, which give it a rough, hairy appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is often used in traditional medicine and has some ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage."
