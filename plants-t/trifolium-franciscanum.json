    "intro": "Trifolium franciscanum, commonly known as Franciscan clover, is a species of legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
