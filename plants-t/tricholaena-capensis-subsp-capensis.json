    "intro": "Tricholaena capensis subsp. capensis, commonly known as the Natal grass or African flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form compact clumps. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical heads. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
