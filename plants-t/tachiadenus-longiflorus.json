    "intro": "Tachiadenus longiflorus, commonly known as the long-flowered tachiadenus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small white or greenish flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
