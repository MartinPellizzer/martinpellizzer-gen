    "intro": "Trichilia septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern trichilia, is a deciduous tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other tropical hardwoods. The tree is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in lowland tropical forests. The plant has some traditional uses in local medicine, though its botanical significance is still being studied."
