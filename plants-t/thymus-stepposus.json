    "intro": "Thymus stepposus, commonly known as steppe thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, creeping growth habit and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its medicinal and culinary uses. Thymus stepposus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
