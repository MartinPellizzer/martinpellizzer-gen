    "intro": "Trixis verbascifolia, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fibrous roots help it survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Trixis verbascifolia plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
