    "intro": "Tetraglochin buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Tetraglochin buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display."
