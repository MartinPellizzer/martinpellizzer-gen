    "intro": "Trifolium breweri, commonly known as Brewer's clover, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
