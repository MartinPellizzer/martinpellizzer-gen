It is native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of grasses or sedges. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Thrinax graminifolia is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
