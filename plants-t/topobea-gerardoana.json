    "intro": "Topobea gerardoana, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a velvety texture, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and unique blooming habits, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
