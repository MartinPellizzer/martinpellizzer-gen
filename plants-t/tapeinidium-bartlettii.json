    "intro": "Tapeinidium bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's tapeinidium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
