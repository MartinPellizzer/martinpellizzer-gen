    "intro": "Taraxacum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces a yellow composite flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum alpinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
