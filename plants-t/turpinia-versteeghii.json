It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that are typically reddish when mature. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in the production of turpentine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
