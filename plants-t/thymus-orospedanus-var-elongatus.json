    "intro": "Thymus orospedanus var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color and emit a strong thyme aroma. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and digestive benefits."
