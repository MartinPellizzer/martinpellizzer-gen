    "intro": "Torreya unda, commonly known as the Japanese torreya, is a rare evergreen conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, oval-shaped cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
