    "intro": "Tectaria subdigitata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow, finger-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, protective layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Tectaria subdigitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
