    "intro": "Thelypteris scolopendrioides, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, golden-brown layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. The fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its habitat."
