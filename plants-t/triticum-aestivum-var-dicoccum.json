    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient grain with a rich botanical history. It is characterized by its tough, glume-like bracts that enclose the florets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are small and hard, with a high protein content and a unique nutty flavor. Emmer wheat is closely related to modern wheat but has been less widely cultivated in recent times."
