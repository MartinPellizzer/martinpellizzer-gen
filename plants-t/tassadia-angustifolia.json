    "intro": "Tassadia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tassadia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
