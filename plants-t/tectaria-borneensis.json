    "intro": "Tectaria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil. The fronds are covered with a layer of fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide protection against herbivores."
