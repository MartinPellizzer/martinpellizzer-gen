    "intro": "Triticum alpestre, commonly known as alpine wheat, is a wild grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its grains are usually small and hard, with a high protein content. Triticum alpestre is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and resilience to harsh conditions."
