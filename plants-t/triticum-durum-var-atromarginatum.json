    "intro": "Triticum durum var. atromarginatum, commonly known as black triticale, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between wheat (Triticum durum) and rye (Secale cereale). It is characterized by its dark-colored seed coat, which gives it the name \"atromarginatum,\" meaning \"black margin.\" This variety is valued for its high protein content and adaptability to various soil conditions. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. It is primarily cultivated for forage, animal feed, and in some cases, human consumption due to its nutritional profile."
