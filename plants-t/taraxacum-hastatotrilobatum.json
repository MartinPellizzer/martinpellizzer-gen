    "intro": "Taraxacum hastatotrilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The flower head consists of numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. This species is native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common and easily identifiable weed in various habitats."
