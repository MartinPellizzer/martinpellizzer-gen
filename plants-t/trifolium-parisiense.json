    "intro": "Trifolium parisiense, commonly known as French clover, is a species of the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop. Trifolium parisiense is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
