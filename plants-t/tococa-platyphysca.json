    "intro": "Tococa platyphysca, commonly known as the flat-lobed tococa, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive flat or broad lobed shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Tococa platyphysca is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
