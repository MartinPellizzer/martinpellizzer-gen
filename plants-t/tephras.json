    "intro": "Tephras, commonly known as volcanic ash, is a type of pyroclastic material formed from fragmented volcanic rock and glass. It is composed of fine particles of ash and pumice, often produced during explosive volcanic eruptions. Tephras can vary in composition depending on the type of magma and eruption conditions. It plays a significant role in shaping landscapes and influencing climate patterns. Botanically, tephras can affect soil fertility and plant growth by adding minerals to the soil."
