    "intro": "Tragacantha florida, commonly known as the Persian violet, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a distinctive, sticky resin known as tragacanth, which has been historically used in medicine and as a food additive. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or biennial. Tragacantha florida thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
