It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features small, delicate, and often overlapping leaves that are typically green and glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky habitats. The fronds produce spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in spore clusters called sori."
