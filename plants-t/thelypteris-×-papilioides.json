    "intro": "Thelypteris \u00d7 papilioides, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Thelypteris acutifolia* and *Thelypteris pteropus*. It is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture and a distinctive, glossy appearance. Its reproductive structures are underdeveloped, making it reliant on vegetative propagation for survival. Thelypteris \u00d7 papilioides is often found growing on tree trunks or in shaded, humid environments, showcasing its adaptability to tropical climates."
