    "intro": "Thymus umbrosus, commonly known as the dark thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, gray-green leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
