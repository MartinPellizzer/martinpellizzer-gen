    "intro": "Trifolium roussaeanum, commonly known as the Roussaean clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stalk. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The flowers are small and typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees. It is a hardy perennial that plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
