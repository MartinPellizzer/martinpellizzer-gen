    "intro": "Tournefortia canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf tournefortia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its grayish-silver foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and covered in fine, silky hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Tournefortia canescens is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and arid conditions."
