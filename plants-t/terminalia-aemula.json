    "intro": "Terminalia aemula, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its rounded, clustered inflorescences that resemble snowballs, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Terminalia aemula is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun."
