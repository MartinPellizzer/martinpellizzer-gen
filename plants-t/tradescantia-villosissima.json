    "intro": "Tradescantia villosissima, commonly known as the velvet leaf or spiderwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking, waxy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its \"velvet\" appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This plant is also valued for its ability to spread via rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
