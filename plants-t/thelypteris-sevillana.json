    "intro": "Thelypteris sevillana, commonly known as the Seville holly fern, is a species of fern native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Thelypteris sevillana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
