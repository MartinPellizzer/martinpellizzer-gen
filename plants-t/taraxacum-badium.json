    "intro": "Taraxacum badium, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a single, yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy pappus for seed dispersal. Native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant is perennial, with a deep taproot that allows it to survive harsh environmental conditions. Its morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine flora."
