    "intro": "Tragacantha baicalensis, commonly known as the Chinese tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been used traditionally in Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. Its botanical features include a woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is often grown for its economic value due to the gum it yields."
