It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, segmented fruits that are similar in appearance to mangosteens.

Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
