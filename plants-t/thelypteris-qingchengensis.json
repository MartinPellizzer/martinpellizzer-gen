It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. The Qingcheng fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
