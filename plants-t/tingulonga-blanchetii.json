    "intro": "Tingulonga blanchetii, commonly known as the African orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are often found in rich, humus-filled soil, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
