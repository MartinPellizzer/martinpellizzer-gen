    "intro": "Thalictrum foliolosum, commonly known as the fernleaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are surrounded by showy, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Thalictrum foliolosum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
