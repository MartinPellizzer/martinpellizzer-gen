    "intro": "Tricholaena rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Tricholaena rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
