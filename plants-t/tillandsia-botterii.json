    "intro": "Tillandsia botterii, commonly known as the Botter's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has grayish-green, strap-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia botterii is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
