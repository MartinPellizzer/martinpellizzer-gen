    "intro": "Tupa salicifolia var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple willow, is a variant of the willow tree characterized by its striking purple foliage. This plant is native to regions of South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a distinctive purplish hue that intensifies in cooler weather. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
