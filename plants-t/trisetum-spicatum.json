    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Trisetum spicatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
