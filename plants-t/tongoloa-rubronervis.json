    "intro": "Tongoloa rubronervis, commonly known as the red-veined fern, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its vascular system is highly specialized, allowing it to efficiently transport nutrients and water through its intricate network of veins. The red pigmentation in its veins is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also serve as a protective mechanism against UV radiation."
