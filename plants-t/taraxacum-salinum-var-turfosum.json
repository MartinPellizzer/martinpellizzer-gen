    "intro": "Taraxacum salinum var. turfosum, commonly known as the salt meadow dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to saline and coastal environments. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by wind-dispersed seeds with pappus. It thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found in coastal marshes and salt meadows. This variant is distinguished by its adaptation to high-salt environments, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems."
