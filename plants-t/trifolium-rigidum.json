    "intro": "Trifolium rigidum, commonly known as rigid clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, enriching the soil. Trifolium rigidum is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
