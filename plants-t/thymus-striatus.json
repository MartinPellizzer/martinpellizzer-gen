    "intro": "Thymus striatus, commonly known as the striated thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has narrow, gray-green leaves with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, are used in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. Thymus striatus is also valued as a culinary herb, though its strong flavor makes it less common in modern cooking."
