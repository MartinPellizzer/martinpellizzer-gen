It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. It is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in sunny conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
