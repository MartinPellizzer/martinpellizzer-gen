It features delicate, fern-like foliage with finely divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, ornamental plant."
