    "intro": "Tragacantha hispidula, commonly known as the hairy tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its gelatinous sap, which has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Due to its resilience and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in arid and semi-arid environments."
