    "intro": "Taeniophyllum reijnvaanae, commonly known as the \"Rajah's ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited natural propagation, it is considered critically endangered."
