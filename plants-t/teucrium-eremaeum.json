    "intro": "Teucrium eremaeum, commonly known as the desert germander, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, grayish hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly aromatic scent. Teucrium eremaeum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
