It is characterized by its elongated antennae, which are often longer than its body, and its distinctive coloration, typically ranging from brown to black. This species is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, inhabiting woodlands and forested areas. The larvae of Tithymalus longicorniculatus feed on dead or decaying wood, contributing to the decomposition process in forest ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and specialized beetle."
