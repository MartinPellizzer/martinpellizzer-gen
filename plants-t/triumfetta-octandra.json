    "intro": "Triumfetta octandra, commonly known as the African blue morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 2 meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the morning. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
