    "intro": "Triainolepis arcuata var. pubituba, commonly known as the hairy triainolepis, is a rare and unusual plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and distinctive umbellate inflorescences. The plant exhibits a pubescent or hairy texture on its stems and leaves, which is a defining trait of the varietal form pubituba. Its leaves are typically lanceolate, with a serrated margin, and the flowers are small and white, arranged in clustered umbels. This variant is often found in specific microhabitats, contributing to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
