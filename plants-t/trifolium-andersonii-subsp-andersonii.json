It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
