    "intro": "Thalictrum erectum, commonly known as the upright meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often described as lacy or delicate in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pale yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Thalictrum erectum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in shady, wet conditions."
