    "intro": "Trichotosia compressa, commonly known as the flatleaf trichotosia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often compressed and have a smooth texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Trichotosia compressa is adapted to moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils."
