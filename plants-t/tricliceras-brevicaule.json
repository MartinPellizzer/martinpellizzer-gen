    "intro": "Tricliceras brevicaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed triclicera, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its short, sturdy stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer. It is native to a specific region in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
