    "intro": "Trichomanes capillaceum var. capillaceum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201350 cm long, with a soft, silvery-green hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental rock gardens."
