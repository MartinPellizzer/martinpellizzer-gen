    "intro": "Tragacantha cyllenea, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Tragacantha cyllenea is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions."
