    "intro": "Terminalia nyassensis, commonly known as African snowball, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that turn bright yellow before shedding in the dry season. The tree produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in dense clusters, resembling snowballs, hence its common name. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
