    "intro": "Tillandsia jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant does not require soil for growth and instead thrives by attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its unique growth habits and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
