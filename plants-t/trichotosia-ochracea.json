It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
