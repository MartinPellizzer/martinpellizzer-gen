    "intro": "Tragacantha speirocarpa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Tragacantha speirocarpa is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
