It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with upright stems and clustered foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Trimeiandra is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
