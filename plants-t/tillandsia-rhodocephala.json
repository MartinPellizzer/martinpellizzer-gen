    "intro": "Tillandsia rhodocephala, commonly known as the red-headed air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rosette-shaped leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding visual interest to its appearance. It is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal direct sunlight to thrive."
