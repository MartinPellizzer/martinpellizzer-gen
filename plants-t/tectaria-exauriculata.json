    "intro": "Tectaria exauriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped tectaria, is a fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that often have a wavy or undulating appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Tectaria exauriculata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and moist forest understories."
