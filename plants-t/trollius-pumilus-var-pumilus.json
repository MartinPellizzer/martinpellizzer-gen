    "intro": "Trollius pumilus var. pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in specialized habitats such as alpine meadows and mountain slopes."
