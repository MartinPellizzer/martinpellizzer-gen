    "intro": "Taraxacum subulatidens, commonly known as the needleleaf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to regions of East Asia, including China and Japan, this plant thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other dandelion species, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
