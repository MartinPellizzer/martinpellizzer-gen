    "intro": "Trias nana, commonly known as the dwarf trias, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many familiar plants such as philodendrons and calla lilies. The plant features a short, stocky stem with heart-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green color. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Trias nana is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
