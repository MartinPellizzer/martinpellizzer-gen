    "intro": "Thymus narymensis, commonly known as the Narymenian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Thymus narymensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
