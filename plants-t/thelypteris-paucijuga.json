    "intro": "Thelypteris paucijuga, commonly known as the few-leaved shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fertile fronds. Thelypteris paucijuga thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
