    "intro": "Triticum triunciale var. brachyatherum, commonly known as the dwarf rye grass, is a variety of rye characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other rye species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands or along field edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a robust tillering habit, which contribute to its hardiness and adaptability. This variety is valued for its use in forage, erosion control, and as a cover crop due to its resilience and rapid establishment."
