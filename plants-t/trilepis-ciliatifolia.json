    "intro": "Trilepis ciliatifolia, commonly known as the hairy-leaved trilepis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are softly hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions."
