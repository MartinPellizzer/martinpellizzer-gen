    "intro": "Tragopogon kashmirianus, commonly known as the Kashmir goatherd's weed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features a tall, slender stem with narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into achene fruits. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
