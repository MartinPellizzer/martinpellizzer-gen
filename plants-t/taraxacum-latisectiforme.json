    "intro": "Taraxacum latisectiforme, commonly known as the broad-sectile dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers develop into a white, spherical seed head known as a pappus, which is easily dispersed by the wind. This species is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils."
