    "intro": "Trientalis europaea var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic starflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers during late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is characterized by its compact growth form and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
