    "intro": "Tococa peckiana, commonly known as the Amazonian pepper plant, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually give way to bright red, peppery fruits. Its leaves and fruits are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss, Tococa peckiana is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native ecosystems."
