    "intro": "Thalictrum deciternatum, commonly known as the meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it is often found in wet meadows and along river edges. Thalictrum deciternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
