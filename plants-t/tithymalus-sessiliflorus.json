    "intro": "Tithymalus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower tithymalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, clustered flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowering period generally occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
