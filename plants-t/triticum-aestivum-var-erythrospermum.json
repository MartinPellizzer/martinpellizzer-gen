    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. erythrospermum, commonly known as red-seeded wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its distinctive red-colored seeds. This variety is primarily cultivated for its unique seed color, which can be used in specialty food products or as a ornamental plant. The plant is an annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, hard grains. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The red pigmentation of its seeds is due to the presence of anthocyanin, a water-soluble pigment found in many plants."
