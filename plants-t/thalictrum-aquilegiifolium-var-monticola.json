    "intro": "Thalictrum aquilegiifolium var. monticola, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
