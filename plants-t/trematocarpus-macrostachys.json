    "intro": "Trematocarpus macrostachys, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, forming a water-holding cup at the center. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system adapted for nutrient absorption from the air and decaying plant matter. Trematocarpus macrostachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right environment."
