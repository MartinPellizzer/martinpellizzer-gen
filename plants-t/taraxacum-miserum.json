The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and gardens, and thrives in temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to produce a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds. Taraxacum miserum is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads."
