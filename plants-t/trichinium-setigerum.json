    "intro": "Trichinium setigerum, commonly known as the hairy trichinium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Trichinium setigerum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
