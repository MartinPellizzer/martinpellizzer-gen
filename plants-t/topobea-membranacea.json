    "intro": "Topobea membranacea, commonly known as the membranous topobea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
