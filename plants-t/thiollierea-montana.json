    "intro": "Thiollierea montana, commonly known as the mountain thiollierea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Thiollierea montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
