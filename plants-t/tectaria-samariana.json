    "intro": "Tectaria samariana, commonly known as the Samarian shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer that helps retain moisture. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
