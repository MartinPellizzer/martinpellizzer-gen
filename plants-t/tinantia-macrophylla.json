    "intro": "Tinantia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant fern or giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnate segments, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Tinantia macrophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
