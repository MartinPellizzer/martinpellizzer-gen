    "intro": "Trifolium scaettae, commonly known as the Scaetta's clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
