    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum var. aridus, commonly known as desert thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features compact, aromatic foliage with small, gray-green leaves that are densely packed on creeping stems. The plant produces tiny pink or purple flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. This variety is often used in xeriscaping and as a culinary herb due to its pungent, thyme-like aroma."
