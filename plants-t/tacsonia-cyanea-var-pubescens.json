    "intro": "Tacsonia cyanea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. The hairy bluebell is an important nectar source for early pollinators and is often found in woodlands and forest edges."
