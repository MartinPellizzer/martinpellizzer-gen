    "intro": "Thelypteris pennellii, commonly known as the Pennell's shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with arching fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The fronds are bipinnate, with closely spaced, narrow pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant's botanical structure makes it well adapted to humid, tropical climates, though it can tolerate a range of soil conditions."
