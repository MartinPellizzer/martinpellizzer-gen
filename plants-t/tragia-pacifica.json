    "intro": "Tragia pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific tragia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tragia pacifica thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and saline environments."
