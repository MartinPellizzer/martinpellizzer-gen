    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudolarssonii, commonly known as the Swedish dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces wind-dispersed seeds. Native to Europe, this species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is adapted to temperate climates. Taraxacum pseudolarssonii is similar to other dandelion species but can be distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
