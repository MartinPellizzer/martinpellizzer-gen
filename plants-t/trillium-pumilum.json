    "intro": "Trillium pumilum, commonly known as dwarf trillium, is a small perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features three elliptic-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces a single, nodding white flower with three petals and three sepals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rich, moist woodlands and prefers partial to full shade. Trillium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
