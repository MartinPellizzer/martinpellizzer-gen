    "intro": "Thelypteris pilososquamata, commonly known as the hairy scale fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Thelypteris pilososquamata plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
