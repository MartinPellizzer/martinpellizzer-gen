It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and a single, upright stem that bears a yellow flower head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Its flowers produce a capsule that releases seeds with feathery parachutes for wind dispersal. The species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
