    "intro": "Taraxacum ahlneri, commonly known as the Ahlner's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that terminates in a yellow flower head. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, allowing its seeds to be carried by the wind. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the genus Taraxacum, known for its ecological and ornamental value."
