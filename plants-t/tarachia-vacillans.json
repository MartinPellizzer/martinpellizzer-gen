    "intro": "Tarachia vacillans, commonly known as the wavering tarplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Tarachia vacillans is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and roadsides."
