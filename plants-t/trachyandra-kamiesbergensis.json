It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
