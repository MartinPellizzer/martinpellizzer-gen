    "intro": "Thymus austriacus, commonly known as Austrian thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color and densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink to violet flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
