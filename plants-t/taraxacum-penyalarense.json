    "intro": "Taraxacum penyalarense, commonly known as the Azores dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Azores archipelago. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and milky sap. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and rocky soils, thriving in the mild, humid climate of the Azores. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers develop into elongated, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
