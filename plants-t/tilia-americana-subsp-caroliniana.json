    "intro": "Tilia americana subsp. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, oval nuts enclosed in a fibrous husk, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the wood is soft and lightweight, making it suitable for carving and paper production."
