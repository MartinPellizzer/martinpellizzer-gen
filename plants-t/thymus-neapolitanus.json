It features small, fragrant leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a strong, minty aroma. The plant produces tiny pink or violet flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for culinary and medicinal uses."
