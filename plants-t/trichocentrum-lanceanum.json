    "intro": "Trichocentrum lanceanum, commonly known as the lanceanum orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its flowers, which are often white or pale pink, bloom during the rainy season and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Trichocentrum lanceanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
