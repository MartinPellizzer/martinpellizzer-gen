It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are deeply divided into lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, supporting its upright growth habit. Thelypteris santomasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dense, attractive foliage."
