    "intro": "Triticum litorale var. glaucum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand saline and wind-prone environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to green flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its salt tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
