    "intro": "Thymus angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically narrow and linear, arranged in dense mats. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are valued for their medicinal and culinary uses."
