    "intro": "Tetrapterys crispa var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
