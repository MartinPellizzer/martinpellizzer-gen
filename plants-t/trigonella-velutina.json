    "intro": "Trigonella velutina, commonly known as velvet trigonella, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a slender pod that contains several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trigonella velutina is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
