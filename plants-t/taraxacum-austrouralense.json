    "intro": "Taraxacum austrouralense, commonly known as the southern alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that produces composite yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and exhibits a robust root system for nutrient absorption. It is often found in grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
