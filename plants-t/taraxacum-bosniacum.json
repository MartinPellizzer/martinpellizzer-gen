    "intro": "Taraxacum bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus, facilitating its spread over long distances. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Taraxacum bosniacum is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
