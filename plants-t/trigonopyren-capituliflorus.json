    "intro": "Trigonopyren capituliflorus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It blooms during the cooler months, typically from late winter to early spring. Trigonopyren capituliflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
