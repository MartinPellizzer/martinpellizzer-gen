    "intro": "Thelypteris nymphalis, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Thelypteris nymphalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
