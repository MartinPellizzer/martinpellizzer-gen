It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant has dense, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Tillandsia baileyi is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
