    "intro": "Teucrium buxifolium var. thymifolium, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, aromatic leaves that are closely packed and resemble those of thyme, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory benefits."
