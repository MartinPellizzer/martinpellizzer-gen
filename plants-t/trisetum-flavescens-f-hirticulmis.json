    "intro": "Trisetum flavescens f. hirticulmis, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It features slender, wiry stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a pale green coloration that becomes more yellowish towards the base. This variety thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
