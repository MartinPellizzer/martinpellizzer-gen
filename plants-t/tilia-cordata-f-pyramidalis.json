    "intro": "Tilia cordata f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime or pyramid hornbeam, is a compact, slow-growing tree with a distinctive conical shape. It features heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more narrow than those of the typical Tilia cordata. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, followed by small, round, brown fruits. It is well-suited for small gardens due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
