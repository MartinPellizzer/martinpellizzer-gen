    "intro": "Toxicodendron villosissimum, commonly known as the velvetleaf poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant contains urushiol, a potent allergenic oil that causes skin irritation in many individuals. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
