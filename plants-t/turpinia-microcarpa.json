    "intro": "Turpinia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf hibiscus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange-red capsules containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for garden use in warm climates."
