It is a perennial shrub that produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
