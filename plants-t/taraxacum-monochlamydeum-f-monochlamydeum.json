    "intro": "Taraxacum monochlamydeum f. monochlamydeum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are hairy and covered with white milky sap. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem topped with a single, bright yellow flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, elongated seed head known as a \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed areas."
