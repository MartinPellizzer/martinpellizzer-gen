    "intro": "Thymus cappadocicus var. globifer, commonly known as globeflower thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Turkey. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, known for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses."
