    "intro": "Thelypteris elmerorum, commonly known as Elmer's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Thelypteris elmerorum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native ecosystems."
