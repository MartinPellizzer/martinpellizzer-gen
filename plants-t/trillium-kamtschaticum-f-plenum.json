    "intro": "Trillium kamtschaticum f. plenum, commonly known as the Siberian trillium, is a rare and distinctive botanical species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its three large, waxy, greenish-white petals and three sepals that are often a different color, typically reddish or purple. The plant produces a single, showy flower that blooms in early spring, often before its leaves fully emerge. It thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
