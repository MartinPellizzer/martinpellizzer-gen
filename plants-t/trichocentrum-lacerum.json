    "intro": "Trichocentrum lacerum, commonly known as the Shattered Lip Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. Trichocentrum lacerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
