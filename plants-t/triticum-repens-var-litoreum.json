    "intro": "Triticum repens var. litoreum, commonly known as sea barley, is a variant of the annual grass species that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are often dispersed by wind. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread and colonize sandy or shingle beaches. Due to its hardy nature, Triticum repens var. litoreum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
