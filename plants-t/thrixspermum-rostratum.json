It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, fleshy fruits resembling a beak, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it is often cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a mildly sweet and tangy flavor. Thrixspermum rostratum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
