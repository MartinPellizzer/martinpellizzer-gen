    "intro": "Tetraplasandra hawaiensis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender Hawaiian mahogany, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian conservation laws. Its unique botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and botanical study."
