    "intro": "Tephrosia cinerea, commonly known as ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, woody stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its scientific name reflects its pale, ghostly appearance, and it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Tephrosia cinerea is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
