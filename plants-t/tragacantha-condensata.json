    "intro": "Tragacantha condensata, commonly known as the dense thorned tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in desert environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
