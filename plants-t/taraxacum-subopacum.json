    "intro": "Taraxacum subopacum, commonly known as the opacous dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to central and eastern Europe, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, forming the characteristic fluffy white pappus that is typical of the genus Taraxacum. The plant has a rosette growth form and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands."
