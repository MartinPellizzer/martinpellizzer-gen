    "intro": "Triaspis diotostigma, commonly known as the red-veined dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with prominent red veins. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that develop into fluffy white seeds, typical of the dandelion genus. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
