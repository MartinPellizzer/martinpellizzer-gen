    "intro": "Taraxacum platycarpum var. longeappendiculatum, commonly known as the long-stalked lawn dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its distinctive floral structure. It features elongated peduncles that support its yellow composite flower heads, which consist of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in lawns and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually unbranched. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
