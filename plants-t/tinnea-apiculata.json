    "intro": "Tinnea apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, woody fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Tinnea apiculata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used by local communities."
