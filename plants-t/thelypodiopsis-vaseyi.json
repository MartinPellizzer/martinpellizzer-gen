It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible seeds. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are typically greenish in color. Thelypodiopsis vaseyi thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions."
