    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudoglabrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a crown of white, fluffy seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, and its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators. It is a perennial herb that spreads through both seeds and rhizomes."
