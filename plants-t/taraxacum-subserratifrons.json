    "intro": "Taraxacum subserratifrons, commonly known as the serrated dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, serrated leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces a single, hollow, yellow-orange flower head that develops into a pappus-equipped seed dispersal mechanism. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed with ecological and potential medicinal significance."
