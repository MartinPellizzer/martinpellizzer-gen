    "intro": "Trifolium sebastiani, commonly known as Sebastian's clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
