    "intro": "Triglochin bulbosa var. maura, commonly known as the Maura arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters with rich, muddy substrates. Triglochin bulbosa var. maura plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
