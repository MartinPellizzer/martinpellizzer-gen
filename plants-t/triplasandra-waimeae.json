    "intro": "Triplasandra waimeae, commonly known as the Waimea triplasandra, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. It has simple, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, clustered flowers that are followed by dark blue berries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Triplasandra waimeae is considered a critically endangered species."
