It belongs to the family Turneraceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers are tubular and are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
