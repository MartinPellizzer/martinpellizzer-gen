    "intro": "Turnera melochioides var. ramosissima, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense, branched foliage. The plant produces showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features include opposite leaves with serrated edges and small, inconspicuous true flowers that bloom in clusters."
