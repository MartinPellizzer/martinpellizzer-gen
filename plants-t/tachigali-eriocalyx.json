    "intro": "Tachigali eriocalyx, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a pod containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Tachigali eriocalyx is valued for its hard, durable wood, though it is also threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
