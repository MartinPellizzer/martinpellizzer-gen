    "intro": "Typha domingensis var. angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf cattail, is a wetland plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and cylindrical flower heads. It thrives in freshwater marshes and along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant produces a distinctive brown, mat-like structure that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands in suitable habitats. This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
