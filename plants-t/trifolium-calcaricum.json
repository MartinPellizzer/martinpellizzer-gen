    "intro": "Trifolium calcaricum, commonly known as the mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, often with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Trifolium calcaricum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil it inhabits."
