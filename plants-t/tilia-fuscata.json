    "intro": "Tilia fuscata, commonly known as the black-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while its wood is soft and lightweight. Tilia fuscata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
