    "intro": "Trixago apula var. flaviflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered trixago, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container cultivation. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is often sought after by horticulturists and botanists."
