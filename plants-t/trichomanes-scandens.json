    "intro": "Trichomanes scandens, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, using its wiry stems to ascend tree trunks or other supports. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it an intriguing subject for botanical and ecological study."
