    "intro": "Tovomitopsis paniculata, commonly known as the panicle milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Tovomitopsis paniculata is valued for its ecological role in supporting butterfly populations, particularly the monarch butterfly."
