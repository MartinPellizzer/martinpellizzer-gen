    "intro": "Taraxacum pudicum, commonly known as the meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and a long, hollow stem that supports a single, inconspicuous yellow flower head. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a fluffy pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Taraxacum pudicum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
