    "intro": "Taraxacum pallidissimum, commonly known as the pale dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a slender, hollow stem that supports a single, yellow flower head. The plant produces a distinctive, spherical seed head composed of numerous parachute-like seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This species is notable for its low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
