    "intro": "Tilia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the globe-leaf lime, is a rare and ancient species of tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spherical-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of other lime species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by round, fleshy fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Tilia sphaerocarpa is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
