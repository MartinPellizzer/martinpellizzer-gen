It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry soils. Trixis sprengeliana is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
