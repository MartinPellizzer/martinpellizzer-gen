    "intro": "Trichipteris lasiosora, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
