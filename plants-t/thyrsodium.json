It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and the presence of composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plants typically have alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy or pubescent. Thyrsodium species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where they thrive in full sun to partial shade."
