    "intro": "Taraxacum pseudocalocephalum f. pseudocalocephalum, commonly known as the pseudocalocephalum dandelion, is a variant of the dandelion species characterized by its unique floral morphology. It features a compact, spiky inflorescence that differs from the typical fluffy seed heads of common dandelions. The plant is perennial, with a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and serrated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its distinct floral structure and its role in supporting pollinators."
