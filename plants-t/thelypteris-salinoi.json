    "intro": "Thelypteris salinoi, commonly known as the salt marsh holly fern, is a species of fern native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray, adapting to the salty, humid environments it inhabits. The plant thrives in brackish or saline soils, often found in tidal marshes and along shorelines. Its fronds are typically upright and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a feathery appearance. Thelypteris salinoi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
