It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and medicinal purposes. The subspecies bivalens is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other thyme species."
