It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are often broader and more rounded compared to the standard form. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and improving soil fertility."
