    "intro": "Thymus angustifolius f. linearifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved thyme with linear leaves, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features aromatic, narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed along the stems, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in culinary and medicinal applications due to its strong, pungent aroma. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny soils."
