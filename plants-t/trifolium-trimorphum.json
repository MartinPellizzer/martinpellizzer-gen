    "intro": "Trifolium trimorphum, commonly known as the three-leafed beauty, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Trifolium trimorphum is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, enriching the soil."
