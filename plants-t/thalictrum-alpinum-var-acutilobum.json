It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with finely divided, acute lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
