It features erect, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers, which are often fragrant. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists worldwide."
