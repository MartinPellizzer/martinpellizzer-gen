    "intro": "Tectaria villosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Tectaria villosa plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
