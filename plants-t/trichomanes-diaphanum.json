    "intro": "Trichomanes diaphanum, commonly known as the glassy harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often translucent, giving it a glass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
