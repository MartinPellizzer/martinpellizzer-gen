    "intro": "Trifolium procerum, commonly known as the tall clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a central stem. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in early summer. Trifolium procerum is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment and agricultural practices."
