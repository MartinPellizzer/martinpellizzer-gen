    "intro": "Trifolium melilotus, commonly known as sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its spikes of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides. Sweet clover is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant for agricultural and ecological purposes."
