It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves and a bright yellow flower head that develops into a white, fluffy seed dispersal mechanism. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
