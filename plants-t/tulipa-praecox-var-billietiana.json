    "intro": "Tulipa praecox var. billietiana, commonly known as the early tulip or the yellow bulbous tulip, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange-red. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous root system typical of many tulip species. It blooms early in the spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early-season display."
