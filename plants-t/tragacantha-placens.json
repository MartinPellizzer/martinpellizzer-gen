    "intro": "Tragacantha placens, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its valuable gum resin. This resin, known as tragacanth, is used in various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Tragacantha placens thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert landscapes."
