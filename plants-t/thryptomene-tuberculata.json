    "intro": "Thryptomene tuberculata, commonly known as the rough thryptomene, is a shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in small, raised bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Thryptomene tuberculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
