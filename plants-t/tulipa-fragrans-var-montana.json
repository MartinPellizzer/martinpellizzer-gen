    "intro": "Tulipa fragrans var. montana, commonly known as the mountain tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often with a distinctive dark eye at the center. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
