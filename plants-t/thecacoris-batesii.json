It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with characteristic milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
