    "intro": "Toxicodendron quercifolium, commonly known as the oak-leaf poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, lobed leaves that resemble those of an oak tree, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers and red, fuzzy berries that are attractive to birds. It contains urushiol, a potent allergen that causes skin irritation in many people. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in forested areas."
