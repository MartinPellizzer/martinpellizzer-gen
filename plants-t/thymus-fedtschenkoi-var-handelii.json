    "intro": "Thymus fedtschenkoi var. handelii, commonly known as the Kashmir thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features compact, mat-forming foliage with small, aromatic leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
