    "intro": "Trifolium rytidosemium subsp. rivulare, commonly known as the river clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged on a slender stem. The plant produces small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Due to its preference for wet habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
