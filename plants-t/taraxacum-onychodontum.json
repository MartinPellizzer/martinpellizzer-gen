    "intro": "Taraxacum onychodontum, commonly known as the toothed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a yellow composite flower head that develops into a spherical, spiky seed head. Native to Europe, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures, aiding in its spread. It is considered a herbaceous perennial, typically growing to a height of 10\u201330 cm."
