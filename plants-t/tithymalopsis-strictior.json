It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
