    "intro": "Triplostegia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered triplostegia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and a distinct scent. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
