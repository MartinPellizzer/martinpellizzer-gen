    "intro": "Terminalia subsericea, commonly known as African snowball, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble snowballs, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, round, yellow or brown fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Terminalia subsericea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine."
