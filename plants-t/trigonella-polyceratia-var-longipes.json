    "intro": "Trigonella polyceratia var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed fenugreek, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to common fenugreek. The variety 'longipes' is distinguished by its longer stems and leaves compared to the typical form."
