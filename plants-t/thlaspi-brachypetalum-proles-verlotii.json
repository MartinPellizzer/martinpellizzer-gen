    "intro": "Thlaspi brachypetalum proles verlotii, commonly known as the alpine cabbages or rock cabbages, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
