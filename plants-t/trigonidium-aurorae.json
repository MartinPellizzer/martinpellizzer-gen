    "intro": "Trigonidium aurorae, commonly known as the dawn's triangle, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Southeast Asia. It features three distinct, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically around the time of sunrise. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, Trigonidium aurorae is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
