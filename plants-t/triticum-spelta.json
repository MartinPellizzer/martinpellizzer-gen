    "intro": "Triticum spelta, commonly known as spelt, is an ancient grain species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its hard, inedible hull that encases the edible grain, which is typically removed during processing. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, each containing two to three florets that develop into grains. Spelt is known for its high nutritional value, containing a variety of minerals, proteins, and dietary fiber. Its botanical features make it a resilient crop adapted to a range of environmental conditions."
