    "intro": "Trachypogon montufarii var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-haired trachypogon, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying native grass species."
