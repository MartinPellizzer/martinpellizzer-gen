    "intro": "Trifolium clusii var. gossypinum, commonly known as the red clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink or reddish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This species is also valued for its role in agriculture as a forage crop and for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
