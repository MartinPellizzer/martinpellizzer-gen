    "intro": "Thespesia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, rough, and often aromatic bark. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a velvety texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Thespesia brasiliensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
