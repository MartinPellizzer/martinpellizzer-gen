    "intro": "Trifolium elgonense, commonly known as Elgon clover, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly found in the high-altitude regions of Kenya and Uganda. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for use in ecological restoration, Trifolium elgonense is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
