    "intro": "Tithymalus blepharophyllus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption, as it cannot photosynthesize due to its absence of chlorophyll. Its delicate structure and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this rare botanical species."
