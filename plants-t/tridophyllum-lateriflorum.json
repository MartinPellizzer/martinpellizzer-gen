    "intro": "Tridophyllum lateriflorum, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of its host trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain toxic seeds. Tridophyllum lateriflorum is found in temperate regions and is often seen growing in clusters on the bark of deciduous trees."
