    "intro": "Telipogon ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist climate. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrate, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
