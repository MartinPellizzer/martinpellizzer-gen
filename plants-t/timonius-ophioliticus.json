    "intro": "Timonius ophioliticus, commonly known as the oceanic shield plant, is a rare species found in specific ophiolitic regions. It thrives in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils derived from ultramafic rock formations. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with elongated, waxy leaves adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of pale blue or white. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered an indicator species for ophiolitic ecosystems."
