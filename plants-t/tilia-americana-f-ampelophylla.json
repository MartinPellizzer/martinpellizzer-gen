    "intro": "Tilia americana f. ampelophylla, commonly known as the American basswood or white poplar, is a cultivar of the native American basswood tree. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are often larger and more lobed than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in pendulous clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
