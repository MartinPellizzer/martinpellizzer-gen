    "intro": "Triglochin procera var. eleutherocarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Triglochin procera."
