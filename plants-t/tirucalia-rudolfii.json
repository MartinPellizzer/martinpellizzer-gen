    "intro": "Tirucalia rudolfii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, three-lobed capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
