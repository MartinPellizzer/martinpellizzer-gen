    "intro": "Trachyrhachis nephropetala, commonly known as the kidney petal orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, kidney-shaped petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trachyrhachis nephropetala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
