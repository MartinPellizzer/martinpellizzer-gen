    "intro": "Trichilia quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved trichilia, is a tropical tree native to Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other economically important hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a distinctive, four-lobed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. The tree is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and it also has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
