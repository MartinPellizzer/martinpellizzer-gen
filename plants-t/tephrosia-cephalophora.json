    "intro": "Tephrosia cephalophora, commonly known as the head-flowered tephrosia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are often trifoliate. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, head-like inflorescences, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Tephrosia cephalophora is also valued for its potential medicinal properties and use in traditional herbal remedies."
