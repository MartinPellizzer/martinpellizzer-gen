    "intro": "Taraxacum atlantis-majoris, commonly known as the Atlantis Majoris dandelion, is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow composite flower heads and heart-shaped basal leaves, typical of the genus Taraxacum. This plant is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces a fluffy seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native regions."
