    "intro": "Tzeltalia amphitricha, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin, nutrient-poor soil of its habitat. Tzeltalia amphitricha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
