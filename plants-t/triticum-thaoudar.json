    "intro": "Triticum thaoudar, commonly known as the desert wheat, is a wild wheat species native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its small, hard grains and robust root system that allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It is adapted to low water conditions and can survive extreme temperatures. Due to its resilience, it is of interest for agricultural research in drought-prone areas."
