    "intro": "Thladiantha sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a stalk. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are small, red, and edible, though they are not commonly consumed by humans. Thladiantha sessilifolia is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
