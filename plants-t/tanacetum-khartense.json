It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dry garden environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves and flowers, are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Tanacetum khartense is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
