    "intro": "Tylostigma madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascan cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, which are typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its restricted habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
