    "intro": "Tristagma peregrinans, commonly known as the wandering tristagma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Tristagma peregrinans is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
