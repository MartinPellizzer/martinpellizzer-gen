    "intro": "Trigonella occulta, commonly known as the hidden trigonella, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous structure. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, pod-like fruits and are used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits. Despite its limited visibility, Trigonella occulta plays a role in soil stabilization and can contribute to biodiversity in its native habitats."
