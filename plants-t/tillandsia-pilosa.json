    "intro": "Tillandsia pilosa, commonly known as the woolly air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fluffy appearance. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it thrives in humid, well-lit environments. Tillandsia pilosa is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
