    "intro": "Trifolium eriocephalum f. villiferum, commonly known as the hairy vernal clover, is a botanical variant of the vernal clover species. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves, which are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its common name. It is native to regions of North America and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This subspecies is often used in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
