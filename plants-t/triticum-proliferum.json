    "intro": "Triticum proliferum, commonly known as the wild rye, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spike-like inflorescence, which bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Triticum proliferum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
