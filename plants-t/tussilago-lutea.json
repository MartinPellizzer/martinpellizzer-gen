    "intro": "Tussilago lutea, commonly known as the yellow lungwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, spotted leaves. The plant produces showy clusters of yellow or orange flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Tussilago lutea thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its potential respiratory benefits."
