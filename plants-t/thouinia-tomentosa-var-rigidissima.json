    "intro": "Thouinia tomentosa var. rigidissima, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. The flowers bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch of color to high-altitude landscapes."
