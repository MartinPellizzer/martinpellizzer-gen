    "intro": "Trichocaulon kubusanum, commonly known as the Kubusan mountain grass, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
