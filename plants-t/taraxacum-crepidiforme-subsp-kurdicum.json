It features a basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a single, elongated, yellow flower head that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stem is often reddish and covered with fine hairs. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family."
