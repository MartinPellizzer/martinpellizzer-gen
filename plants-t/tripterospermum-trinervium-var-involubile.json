It is native to South America and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers followed by red berries that are dispersed by birds. It has a complex life cycle that involves both vegetative growth and seed propagation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
