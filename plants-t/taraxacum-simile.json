    "intro": "Taraxacum simile, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head, or \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with white, feathery parachutes. This species is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed soils."
