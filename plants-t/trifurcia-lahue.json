    "intro": "Trifurcia lahue, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and orange flowers that resemble flames, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant has long, slender stems that can climb or trail, and its leaves are narrow and pointed. Trifurcia lahue thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
