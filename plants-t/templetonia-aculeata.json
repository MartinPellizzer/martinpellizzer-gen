    "intro": "Templetonia aculeata, commonly known as the silky oak, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces woody pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The tree is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils."
