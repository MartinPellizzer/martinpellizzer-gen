    "intro": "Turbinicarpus klinkerianus subsp. hiemalis, commonly known as the winter turbinicarpus, is a succulent cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a low-growing, compact stem that often remains close to the ground, with a rounded, ribbed structure. The plant produces pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
