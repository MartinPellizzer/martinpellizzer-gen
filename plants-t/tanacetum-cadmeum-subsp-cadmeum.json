    "intro": "Tanacetum cadmeum subsp. cadmeum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a repellent for certain insects."
