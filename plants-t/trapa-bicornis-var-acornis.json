    "intro": "Trapa bicornis var. acornis, commonly known as the acorn water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, floating fruits that resemble acorns, which help in seed dispersal. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
