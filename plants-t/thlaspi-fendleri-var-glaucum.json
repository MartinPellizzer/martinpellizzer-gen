    "intro": "Thlaspi fendleri var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants like broccoli and mustard. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous or desert environments. The variety glaucum is distinguished by its bluish-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions."
