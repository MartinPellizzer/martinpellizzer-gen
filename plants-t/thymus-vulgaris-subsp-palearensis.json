    "intro": "Thymus vulgaris subsp. palearensis, commonly known as pale thyme, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, fragrant flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant produces essential oils rich in thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong aromatic profile and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued both for its culinary uses and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
