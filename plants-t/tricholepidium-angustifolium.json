    "intro": "Tricholepidium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, often barbed bristles that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Tricholepidium angustifolium is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
