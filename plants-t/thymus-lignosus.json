    "intro": "Thymus lignosus, commonly known as creeping thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and small, fragrant leaves that emit a strong thyme scent. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its aromatic properties make it valuable in both culinary and medicinal applications."
