    "intro": "Trisetaria koelerioides var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-bracted grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, bracted flowers, which are usually pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
