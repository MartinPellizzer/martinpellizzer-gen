    "intro": "Thymus obtusatus, commonly known as woolly thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, gray-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in dense clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Thymus obtusatus is often used in herbal medicine and as a culinary herb, though its fragrance is more subtle compared to other thyme species."
