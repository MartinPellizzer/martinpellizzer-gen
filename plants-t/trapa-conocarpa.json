    "intro": "Trapa conocarpa, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves and spiny, nut-like fruits that develop underwater. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and the fruits are harvested for their starchy, edible seeds. Trapa conocarpa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
