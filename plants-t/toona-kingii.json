    "intro": "Toona kingii, commonly known as the Australian silkwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Toona kingii is valued for its durable, lightweight wood and is often used in traditional and contemporary woodworking. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun to partial shade."
