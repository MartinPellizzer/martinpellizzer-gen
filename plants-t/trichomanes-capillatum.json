    "intro": "Trichomanes capillatum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to tropical regions. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Trichomanes capillatum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
