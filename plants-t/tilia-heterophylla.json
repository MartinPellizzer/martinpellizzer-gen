    "intro": "Tilia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age. Tilia heterophylla is often found in moist, rich soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
