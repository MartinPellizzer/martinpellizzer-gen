    "intro": "Trifolium obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broad-flowered clover, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Trifolium obtusiflorum is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
