    "intro": "Tamonea impetiolaris, commonly known as the golden bellvista, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble bells. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
