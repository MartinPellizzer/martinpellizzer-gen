    "intro": "Tirpitzia ovoidea, commonly known as the egg-shaped rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its most distinctive feature is its egg-shaped, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and bloom in early spring."
