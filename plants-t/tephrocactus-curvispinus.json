It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive appearance characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its spines are curved and often appear in clusters, providing both protection and a unique visual feature. Tephrocactus curvispinus is well adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
