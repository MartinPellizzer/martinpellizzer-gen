    "intro": "Thelypteris goedenii, commonly known as the Goeden's shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Thelypteris goedenii thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
