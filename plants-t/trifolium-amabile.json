    "intro": "Trifolium amabile, commonly known as the sweet clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Trifolium amabile is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil, making it beneficial for agricultural purposes."
