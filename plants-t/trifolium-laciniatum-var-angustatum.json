    "intro": "Trifolium laciniatum var. angustatum, commonly known as narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
