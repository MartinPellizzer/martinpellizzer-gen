    "intro": "Thymus balcanus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered Balkan thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green foliage and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces aromatic essential oils in its leaves, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral display, setting it apart from other thyme species."
