    "intro": "Tectaria chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in a distinctive pattern."
