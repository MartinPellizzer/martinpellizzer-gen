It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice in xeriscaping and traditional herbal medicine.
