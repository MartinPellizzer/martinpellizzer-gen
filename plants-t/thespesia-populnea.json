    "intro": "Thespesia populnea, commonly known as the Tahitian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or water. Thespesia populnea is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along shorelines."
