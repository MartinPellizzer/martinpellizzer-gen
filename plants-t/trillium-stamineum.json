    "intro": "Trillium stamineum, commonly known as the white trillium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its three erect, lance-shaped leaves and three white petals that resemble a trifoliate pattern. The plant produces a single, showy white flower with six stamens and a prominent central pistil. It typically blooms in early spring and is often found in rich, moist woodlands. Trillium stamineum is known for its slow growth and is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
