    "intro": "Trapa natans var. conocarpa, commonly known as the water chestnut, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a rosette and its distinctive, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss, while its roots anchor it in the substrate. The species is often cultivated for its nutritional value and has been introduced to various regions for agricultural purposes."
