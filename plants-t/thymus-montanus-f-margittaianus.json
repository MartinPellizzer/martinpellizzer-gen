    "intro": "Thymus montanus f. margittaianus, commonly known as the Margittaian thyme, is a rare and ornamental plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, small, grey-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanic collections."
