    "intro": "Taraxacum alaid-montanum, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white pappus for wind dispersal. This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas of Europe and Asia. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitats."
