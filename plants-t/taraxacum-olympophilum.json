It belongs to the dandelion genus, which is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. It produces a distinctive seed head with parachute-like seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
