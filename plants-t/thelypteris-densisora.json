    "intro": "Thelypteris densisora, commonly known as the dense-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen fronds, which are typically leathery and covered in a dense network of veins. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Thelypteris densisora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
