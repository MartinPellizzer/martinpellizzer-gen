    "intro": "Trema asperum var. xerophilum, commonly known as the rough trema, is a variant of the trema plant characterized by its rugged, textured leaves. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in low-water environments. Its leaves are typically small, thick, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
