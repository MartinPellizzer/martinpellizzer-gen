    "intro": "Tryphostemma stolzii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among members of its family. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Tryphostemma stolzii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
