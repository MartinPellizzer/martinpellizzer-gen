    "intro": "Tetragonia calycina, commonly known as the coastal spinach or sea spinach, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dune environments. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its small, yellow flowers are borne in clusters and bloom from late winter to early spring. Tetragonia calycina is valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have a mild, spinach-like flavor."
