    "intro": "Thrinax yuraguana, commonly known as the Yuragu\u00e1na palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Cuba and the Isle of Pines. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with a dense, short trunk and a crown of clustered, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, spiny fruits containing black seeds. It thrives in coastal and limestone-rich soils, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
