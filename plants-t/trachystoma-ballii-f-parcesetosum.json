    "intro": "Trachystoma ballii f. parcesetosum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed trachystoma, is a rare and compact shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value lies in its dense foliage and delicate, pinkish-white blooms that appear in spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
