    "intro": "Tapinanthus brazzavillensis, commonly known as the Congo dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant native to Central and West Africa. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a sprawling, vine-like growth habit. It is often found parasitizing trees and shrubs in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
