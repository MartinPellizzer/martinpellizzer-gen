    "intro": "Tanacetum polycephalum subsp. polycephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils, which also contribute to its historical use in medicinal and pesticidal applications. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender leaves compared to other varieties within the Tanacetum genus."
