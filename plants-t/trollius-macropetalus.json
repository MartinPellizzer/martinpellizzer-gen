    "intro": "Trollius macropetalus, commonly known as the large-petaled globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a short, thick rhizome and has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically 5 to 8 cm in diameter, with large, rounded petals that give it a distinctive appearance. Trollius macropetalus thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows."
