    "intro": "Trifolium depauperatum var. amplectens, commonly known as the slender clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in grassy areas and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
