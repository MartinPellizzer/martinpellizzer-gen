    "intro": "Triticum sativum var. etruscum-robustior, commonly known as the Etruscan robust wheat, is a variant of common wheat characterized by its robust growth habit and increased stem thickness. This variety is typically found in regions with temperate climates and is adapted to withstand moderate drought conditions. It possesses a high gluten content, making it suitable for bread-making and other wheat-based products. The plant exhibits a spikelet structure with awns, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. Its botanical features make it an important subject in agricultural research for improving wheat resilience and yield."
