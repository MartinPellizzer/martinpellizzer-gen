    "intro": "Triadenia sieberi, commonly known as the ghost flower or ghost bean, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, red or orange pod, which is an adaptation for seed dispersal by animals. Triadenia sieberi is notable for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
