    "intro": "Taraxacum amphiphron, commonly known as the double-seed dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the formation of a distinctive pappus-based seed head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with fine, soft hairs. The species is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where each seed is encased in a tuft of white filaments that aid in wind transport."
