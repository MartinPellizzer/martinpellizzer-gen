    "intro": "Thelypteris doctersii, commonly known as the dwarf shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, clustered fronds that are leathery and dark green. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Thelypteris doctersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact growth habit."
