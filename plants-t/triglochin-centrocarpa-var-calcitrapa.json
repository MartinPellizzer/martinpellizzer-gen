    "intro": "Triglochin centrocarpa var. calcitrapa, commonly known as the limestone marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous wetlands. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils and is often found in marshes and fens. Its adaptability to wet, calcium-rich environments makes it an important indicator species for such habitats."
