    "intro": "Tapinanthus fuellebornii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to other plants through specialized root structures. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, often going unnoticed due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is an example of hemiparasitism, as it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends heavily on its host. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
