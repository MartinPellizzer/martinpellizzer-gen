    "intro": "Tisserantodendron chevalieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star tree, is a unique species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. The plant belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes other economically important species such as the cashew and poison ivy. Its botanical features include a woody stem with smooth bark and small, clustered flowers that develop into edible berries. The plant's ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings outside its native range."
