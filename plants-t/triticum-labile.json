    "intro": "Triticum labile, commonly known as the unstable wheat, is a rare and poorly understood species of wild wheat. It is characterized by its small, delicate spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Triticum labile is notable for its genetic instability, which leads to frequent variations in its morphology and chromosome number. Due to its rarity and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and geneticists studying plant evolution and adaptation."
