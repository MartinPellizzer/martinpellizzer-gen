    "intro": "Triticum repens var. dubium, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
