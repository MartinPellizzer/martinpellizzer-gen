    "intro": "Taraxacum dzhungaricola, commonly known as the Dzungarian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Dzungarian Alatau and Tianshan mountain ranges. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and a hollow, leafy stem that supports its yellow composite flower head. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with pappus-attached seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, sharing characteristics with other dandelions and related plants."
