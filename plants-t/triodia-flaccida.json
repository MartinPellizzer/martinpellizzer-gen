    "intro": "Triodia flaccida, commonly known as the slender spinifex grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its tufted, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes, which are typically green or brown in color. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive drought conditions. Triodia flaccida plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
