    "intro": "Thymus aranjuezii, commonly known as the Aranjuez thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features tiny, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils contain thymol, which gives it a strong, pungent fragrance and makes it valuable in herbal medicine and aromatherapy."
