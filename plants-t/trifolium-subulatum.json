    "intro": "Trifolium subulatum, commonly known as the needleleaf clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are narrow and pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Trifolium subulatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in agricultural settings."
