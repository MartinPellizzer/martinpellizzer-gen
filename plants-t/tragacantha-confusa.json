    "intro": "Tragacantha confusa, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The sap of Tragacantha confusa has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural gum in various applications."
