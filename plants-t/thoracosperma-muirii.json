    "intro": "Thoracosperma muirii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has large, elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its ecological importance and limited habitat, Thoracosperma muirii is considered a threatened species."
