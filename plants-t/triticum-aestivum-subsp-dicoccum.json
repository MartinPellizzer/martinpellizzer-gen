    "intro": "Triticum aestivum subsp. dicoccum, commonly known as emmer wheat, is an ancient grain with a rich botanical history. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its hard, hull-covered grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough outer layer, which requires specialized processing for consumption. Emmer wheat is notable for its high protein content and has been cultivated for thousands of years in various regions."
