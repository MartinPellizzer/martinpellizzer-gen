    "intro": "Tinnea antiscorbutica, commonly known as the scurvygrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly serrated edge, and the plant is known for its high vitamin C content. Tinnea antiscorbutica has a long history of use in traditional medicine to prevent and treat scurvy."
