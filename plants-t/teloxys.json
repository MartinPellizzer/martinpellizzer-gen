    "intro": "Teloxys, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, simple, elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The silverleaf tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
