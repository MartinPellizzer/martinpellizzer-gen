It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological role and potential for agricultural use."
