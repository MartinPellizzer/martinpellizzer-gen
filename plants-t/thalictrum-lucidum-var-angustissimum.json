    "intro": "Thalictrum lucidum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf meadow rue, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, angular stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are pinnately compound, with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
