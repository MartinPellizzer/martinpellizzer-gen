    "intro": "Taraxacum semigygaeum, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is a small, perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a yellow flower head that develops into a white, feathery pappus for wind dispersal. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides. It is notable for its ability to tolerate various soil conditions and its role in supporting pollinators."
