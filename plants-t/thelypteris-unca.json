    "intro": "Thelypteris unca, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern found in various regions, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, often curled appearance, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or trees. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a thin, membranous indusium."
