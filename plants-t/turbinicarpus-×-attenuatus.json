    "intro": "Turbinicarpus \u00d7 attenuatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert rose, is a hybrid cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in sparse, white or pale green spines. The plant produces large, showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Turbinicarpus \u00d7 attenuatus is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and resilience."
