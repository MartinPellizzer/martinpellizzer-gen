    "intro": "Tamarix effusa, commonly known as the desert rose or sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Tamarix effusa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
