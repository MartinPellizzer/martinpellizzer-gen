    "intro": "Tragacantha davurica, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a flowering plant native to the dry regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in arid environments, making it an important species in semi-desert ecosystems. Tragacantha davurica is also valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion."
