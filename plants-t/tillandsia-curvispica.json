    "intro": "Tillandsia curvispica, commonly known as the curly-spined air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its foliage is characterized by long, narrow leaves with sharp, curved spines along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
