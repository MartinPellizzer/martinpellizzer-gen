    "intro": "Thlaspi perfoliatum subsp. improperum, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, disturbed habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often clustered around the stem, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
