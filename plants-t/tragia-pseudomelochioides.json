    "intro": "Tragia pseudomelochioides, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is an annual herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Tragia pseudomelochioides is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
