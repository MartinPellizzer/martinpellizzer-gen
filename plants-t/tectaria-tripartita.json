    "intro": "Tectaria tripartita, commonly known as the three-part shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into three parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture. Tectaria tripartita is often found in the understory of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
