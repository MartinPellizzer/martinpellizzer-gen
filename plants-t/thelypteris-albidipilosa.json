    "intro": "Thelypteris albidipilosa, commonly known as the white-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale-colored fronds that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Thelypteris albidipilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
