    "intro": "Triticum caninum var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple dog wheat, is a variant of the dog wheat species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique coloration and potential ecological roles."
