It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Trema nitens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
