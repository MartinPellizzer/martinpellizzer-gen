It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a unique, compact appearance. The plant produces small, vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and striking appearance. This cultivar is well-suited for terrariums and air plants, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring minimal water."
