    "intro": "Taraxacum leucopodioides, commonly known as the whitehead dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and a yellow flowering head that produces a distinctive white pappus for wind dispersal. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant is perennial, with a taproot system that allows it to survive in various soil types. Its botanical features make it a common and ecologically significant species in its native range."
