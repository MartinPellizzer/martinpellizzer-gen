    "intro": "Tetraria sylvatica var. pseudolorea, commonly known as the forest tetraria, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to thrive in shaded, forested environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils of temperate woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
