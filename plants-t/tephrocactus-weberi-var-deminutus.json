    "intro": "Tephrocactus weberi var. deminutus, commonly known as the dwarf Weber's cactus, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to Mexico. It features a globular or cylindrical stem with a grayish-green color and a smooth, spiny surface. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but striking. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
