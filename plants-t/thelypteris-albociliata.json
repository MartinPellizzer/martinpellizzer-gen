    "intro": "Thelypteris albociliata, commonly known as the white-fringed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. The unique combination of its habitat, appearance, and biological features makes it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
