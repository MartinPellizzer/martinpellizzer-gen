    "intro": "Trigonella gladiata var. prostrata, commonly known as prostrate fenugreek, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems that lie flat on the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal remedies and as a cover crop."
