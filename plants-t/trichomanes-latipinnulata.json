    "intro": "Trichomanes latipinnulata, commonly known as the broad-pinnule maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes latipinnulata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
