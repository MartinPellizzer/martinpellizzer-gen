    "intro": "Thelypteris warmingii, commonly known as the warmings' shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to the soil. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
