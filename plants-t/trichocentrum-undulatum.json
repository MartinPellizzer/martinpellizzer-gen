    "intro": "Trichocentrum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaf orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without being parasitic. The plant features long, wavy leaves that are often dark green with a prominent midrib. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike with a pleasant fragrance. Trichocentrum undulatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
