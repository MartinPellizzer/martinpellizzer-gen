    "intro": "Trisetum corsicum, commonly known as Corsican hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and limestone areas. Trisetum corsicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in marginal habitats."
