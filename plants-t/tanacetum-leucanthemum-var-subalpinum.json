    "intro": "Tanacetum leucanthemum var. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine white chrysanthemum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
