    "intro": "Taraxacum jenniskensiae, commonly known as the Jenniskens' dandelion, is a rare and endemic species of the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and a distinctive, hairy stem that distinguishes it from other taraxacum species. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are usually basal, alternate, and have a wavy or serrated margin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
