    "intro": "Thornbera robusta, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, bark-like leaves and milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, appearing in clusters. Thornbera robusta is often used in traditional medicine, though its use requires caution due to its toxic properties."
