    "intro": "Trichomanes pellucens, commonly known as the glassy harchontis, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and covered with a waxy coating, giving them a glassy appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Trichomanes pellucens is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in shady garden settings."
