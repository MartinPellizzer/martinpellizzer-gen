    "intro": "Trollius pumilus var. semifissus, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features delicate, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with hairy, basal leaves that are often divided into lobes. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of small, petal-like bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
