    "intro": "Telanthera philoxeroides var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf telanthera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of showy, pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though care must be taken to control its growth."
