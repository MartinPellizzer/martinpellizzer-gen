    "intro": "Tapinanthus glabratus, commonly known as the naked-stem dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or yellow in color. It is found in various regions of Africa, often growing on shrubs and trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants."
