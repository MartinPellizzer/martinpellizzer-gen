    "intro": "Tium sulcatum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a striking flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, slender stem with striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Tium sulcatum blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a dramatic visual element to its desert habitat."
