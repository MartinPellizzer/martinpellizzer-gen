    "intro": "Taraxacum leporinum, commonly known as the rabbit's parsley or meadow dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus, and it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum leporinum is a hardy perennial that thrives in temperate climates."
