    "intro": "Tridax durangensis, commonly known as the Durango dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the genus Tridax. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. Tridax durangensis is also known for its ability to spread rapidly through wind-dispersed seeds."
