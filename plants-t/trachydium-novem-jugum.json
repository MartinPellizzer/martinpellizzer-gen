    "intro": "Trachydium novem-jugum, commonly known as the nine-armed trachydium, is a rare and enigmatic plant species found in specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its unique floral structure, featuring nine prominent, elongated bracts that give it its common name. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
