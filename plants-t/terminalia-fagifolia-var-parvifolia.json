It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are small, elliptical, and often clustered at the ends of branches, giving it a compact appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, many-seeded pods. This species is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in construction and traditional crafts."
