    "intro": "Taraxacum gratum, commonly known as the showy dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a bright yellow composite flower head that blooms in early spring, followed by a fluffy white seed head that disperses seeds via the wind. It thrives in sunny, open areas such as meadows and gardens, and is often found in disturbed soils. Taraxacum gratum is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
