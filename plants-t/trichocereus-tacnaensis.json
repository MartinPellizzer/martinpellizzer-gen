    "intro": "Trichocereus tacnaensis, commonly known as the Tacna torch cactus, is a species of cactus native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem that can grow up to 6 meters in height, covered with spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in arid, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
