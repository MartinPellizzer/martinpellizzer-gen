    "intro": "Thalictrum alpinum subsp. udocanicum, commonly known as the alpine meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in loose panicles and are pollinated by insects. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
