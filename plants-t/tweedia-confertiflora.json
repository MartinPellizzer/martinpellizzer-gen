    "intro": "Tweedia confertiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered tweedia, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its elegant appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Tweedia confertiflora is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its long-lasting blooms."
