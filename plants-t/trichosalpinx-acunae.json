It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet and purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. The flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
