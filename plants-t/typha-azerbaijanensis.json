    "intro": "Typha azerbaijanensis, commonly known as the Azerbaijani cattail, is a perennial wetland plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the genus Typha in the family Typhaceae, characterized by its tall, cylindrical flowering spikes and broad, sword-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in stabilizing the soil, while its seeds are dispersed by water. The plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
