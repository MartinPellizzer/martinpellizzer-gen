    "intro": "Trachyandra jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacob's beard, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
