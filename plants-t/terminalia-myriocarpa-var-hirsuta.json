It belongs to the family Combretaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by woody, many-seeded fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest in both botanical research and local traditional medicine."
