    "intro": "Trisetum vaccarianum, commonly known as the field panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Trisetum vaccarianum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
