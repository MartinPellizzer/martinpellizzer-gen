    "intro": "Tapeinidium longipinnulum, commonly known as the long-pinnate tapeinidium, is a rare and delicate fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, elongated fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
