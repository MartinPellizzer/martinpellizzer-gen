It features small, dark green, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of pink or violet flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in full sun and cool, humid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
