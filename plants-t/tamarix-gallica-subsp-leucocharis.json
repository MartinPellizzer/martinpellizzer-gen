It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or saline environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across temperate regions."
