    "intro": "Triticum aestivum var. kurduculensecompactoides, commonly known as the compactoid wheat, is a botanical variant of common wheat characterized by its compact growth habit. It exhibits shorter plant stature and reduced tillering compared to standard wheat varieties, making it suitable for specific agricultural conditions. The plant possesses a robust root system and produces small, hard grains that are typically used in traditional baking or as a forage crop. Its genetic makeup includes traits that may enhance drought tolerance and disease resistance. This variety is of interest in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience in challenging environments."
