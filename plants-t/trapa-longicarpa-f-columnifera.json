    "intro": "Trapa longicarpa f. columnifera, commonly known as the columnar water chestnut, is a variant of the water chestnut species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive columnar growth habit, which sets it apart from the more typical bushy form of Trapa longicarpa. The plant features floating leaves with long, narrow petioles that support its dense, spiky inflorescences. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, typical of the Trapaceae family, and it produces\u575a\u679c-like fruits that are often harvested for their starchy seeds. This variant is adapted to aquatic environments, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and nutrient absorption."
