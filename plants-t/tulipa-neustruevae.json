    "intro": "Tulipa neustruevae, commonly known as the Neustrueva tulip, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
