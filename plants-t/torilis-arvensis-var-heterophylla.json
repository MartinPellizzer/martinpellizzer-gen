    "intro": "Torilis arvensis var. heterophylla, commonly known as the field eryngo, is a variable annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that may vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are often mistaken for dandelions. The fruit is a small, dry, three-lobed achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal."
