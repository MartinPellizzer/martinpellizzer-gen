    "intro": "Tradescantia subscandens, commonly known as the spiderwort or red-veined ivy, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that often display vivid red or purple veins. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread rapidly and its long-lasting foliage."
