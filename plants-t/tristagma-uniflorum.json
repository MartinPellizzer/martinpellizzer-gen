    "intro": "Tristagma uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower tristagma, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow or greenish in color. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, feather-like leaflets. Tristagma uniflorum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
