    "intro": "Tetrastigma delavayi f. majus, commonly known as the giant grapevine, is a vigorous climbing vine native to China. It belongs to the Vitaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe, though they are less commonly consumed compared to other grape species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at lower elevations. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens."
