    "intro": "Tocoyena bullata f. puberula, commonly known as the velvet tocoyena, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are often a deep green or reddish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
