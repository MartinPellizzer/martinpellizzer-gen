    "intro": "Trichopilia suavis var. alba, commonly known as the sweet trichopilia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical or subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
