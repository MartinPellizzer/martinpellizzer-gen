    "intro": "Troxirum pereskia, commonly known as the roughleaf cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The rough texture of its stems and the presence of areoles are additional botanical features that distinguish it from other cactus species."
