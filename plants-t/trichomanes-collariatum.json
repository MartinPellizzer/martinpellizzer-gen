    "intro": "Trichomanes collariatum, commonly known as the golden holly fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a unique structure with tiny, scale-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist habitat. Its spores are released in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Trichomanes collariatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
