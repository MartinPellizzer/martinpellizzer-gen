It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange fruits that resemble small star-shaped fruits. The plant typically grows as an understory tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it relies on insects for pollination.
