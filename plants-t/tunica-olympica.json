    "intro": "Tunica olympica, commonly known as the Olympic Tunica, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, velvety blue petals that bloom only during the summer months. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance has made it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike. Despite its beauty, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its native habitat."
