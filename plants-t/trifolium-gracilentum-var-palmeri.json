    "intro": "Trifolium gracilentum var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's white clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically pale green to white in color, and its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological and agricultural studies."
