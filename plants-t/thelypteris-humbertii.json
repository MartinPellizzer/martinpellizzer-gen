    "intro": "Thelypteris humbertii, commonly known as Humbert's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris humbertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
