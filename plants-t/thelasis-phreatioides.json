    "intro": "Thelasis phreatioides, commonly known as the water thistle, is a rare aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense inflorescence that blooms in late summer. Thelasis phreatioides plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
