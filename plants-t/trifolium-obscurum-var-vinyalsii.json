    "intro": "Trifolium obscurum var. vinyalsii, commonly known as the Vinyals' clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
