    "intro": "Tabebuia libanensis, commonly known as the Lebanon trumpet tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The tree produces long, pendulous inflorescences with vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate, with a smooth texture and a dark green color. The wood of Tabebuia libanensis is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making."
