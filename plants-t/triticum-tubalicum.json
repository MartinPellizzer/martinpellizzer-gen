    "intro": "Triticum tubalicum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Its seeds are sometimes used in traditional agriculture, though it is considered a weed in cultivated settings. The botanical features of Triticum tubalicum make it an important species for ecological studies and agricultural research."
