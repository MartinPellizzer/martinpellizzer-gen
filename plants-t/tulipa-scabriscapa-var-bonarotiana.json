    "intro": "Tulipa scabriscapa var. bonarotiana, commonly known as the Bonarotian tulip, is a rare and striking bulbous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display. Due to its limited distribution and specific growing conditions, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant for horticulturists."
