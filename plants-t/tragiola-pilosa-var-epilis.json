    "intro": "Tragiola pilosa var. epilis, commonly known as the hairy tragi, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The hairy tragi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
