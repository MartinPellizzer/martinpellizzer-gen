    "intro": "Trichelostylis xyroides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockheath, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which is characterized by its grass-like appearance and adapted growth forms. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or heathland environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spring, and are adapted for pollination by insects."
