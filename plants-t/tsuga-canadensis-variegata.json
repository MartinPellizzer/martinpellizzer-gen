    "intro": "Tsuga canadensis variegata, commonly known as the variegated hemlock, is a variant of the eastern hemlock. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring white and yellow markings on its needle-like leaves. This plant is native to North America and typically grows in moist, shady environments. The variegation is due to genetic mutations that affect chlorophyll production. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
