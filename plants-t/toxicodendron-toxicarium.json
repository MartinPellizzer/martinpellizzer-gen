    "intro": "Toxicodendron toxicarium, commonly known as the toxicodendron, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family, known for its potent dermatological effects. The plant produces a resinous sap that contains urushiol, a compound responsible for severe allergic reactions in humans. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a glossy appearance. The plant is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for direct contact with the skin."
