    "intro": "Trisetum erectum, commonly known as the upright feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers in late summer. Trisetum erectum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
