    "intro": "Terminalia buceras, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing seeds. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts. The plant is also valued for its timber and ornamental appeal."
