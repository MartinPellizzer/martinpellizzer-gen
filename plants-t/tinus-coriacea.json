It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a distinctive white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Tinus coriacea is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
