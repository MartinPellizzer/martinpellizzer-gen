    "intro": "Tulipa aitchisonii var. clusianoides, commonly known as the Aitchison's tulip, is a rare and ornamental bulbous plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring a cold winter dormancy period for proper flowering. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding species for horticultural enthusiasts."
