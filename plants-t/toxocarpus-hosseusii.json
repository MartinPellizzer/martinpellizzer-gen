    "intro": "Toxocarpus hosseusii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
