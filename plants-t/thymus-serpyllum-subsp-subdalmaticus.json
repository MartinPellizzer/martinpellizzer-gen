    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. subdalmaticus, commonly known as the Balkan thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, aromatic leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces pink to purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in morphology and geographic distribution compared to other thyme species."
