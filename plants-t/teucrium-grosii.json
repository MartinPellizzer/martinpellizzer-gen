    "intro": "Teucrium grosii, commonly known as the Alpine germander, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Teucrium grosii thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice among gardeners seeking drought-resistant plants."
