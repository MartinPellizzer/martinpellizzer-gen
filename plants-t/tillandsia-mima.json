    "intro": "Tillandsia mima, commonly known as the Mima air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to capture moisture from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. Tillandsia mima thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires regular misting to maintain its health."
