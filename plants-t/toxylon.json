The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Toxylon is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
