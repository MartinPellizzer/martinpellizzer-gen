    "intro": "Telanthera philoxeroides, commonly known as the swamp mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain areas, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic."
