    "intro": "Triticum turgidum subsp. palaeocolchicum, commonly known as the ancient wheat or paleocolchicum wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and spikelets that bear small, pale florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying the domestication of wheat. This subspecies is considered a potential source of genetic diversity for modern wheat breeding programs."
