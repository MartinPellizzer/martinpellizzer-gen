    "intro": "Trisetaria rigida, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Trisetaria rigida is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological and ornamental landscapes."
