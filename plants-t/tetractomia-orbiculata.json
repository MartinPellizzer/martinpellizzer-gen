    "intro": "Tetractomia orbiculata, commonly known as the orbicular tetractomia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, orbicular leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Tetractomia orbiculata is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
