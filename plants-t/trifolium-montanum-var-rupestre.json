    "intro": "Trifolium montanum var. rupestre, commonly known as the mountain clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically composed of three oval-shaped leaflets with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes."
