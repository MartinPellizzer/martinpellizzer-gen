    "intro": "Trichophorum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas. Trichophorum alpinum is often found in mountain meadows and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
