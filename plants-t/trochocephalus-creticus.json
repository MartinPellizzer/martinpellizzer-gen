    "intro": "Trochocephalus creticus, commonly known as the Cretaceous shield fern, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical structure. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are tightly clasped around the stem. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with a distinct rhizome and small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is of great interest to botanists studying plant evolution."
