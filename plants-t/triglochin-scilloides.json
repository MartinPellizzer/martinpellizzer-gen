    "intro": "Triglochin scilloides, commonly known as the marsh arrowgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wet environments. Triglochin scilloides is adapted to fluctuating water levels and can tolerate periods of submersion."
