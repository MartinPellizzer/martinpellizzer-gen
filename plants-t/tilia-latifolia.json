    "intro": "Tilia latifolia, commonly known as the large-leaf linden, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are broad and often have a wavy margin. The tree produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. These flowers are followed by small, spherical fruits that contain seeds. Tilia latifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in mixed hardwood forests."
