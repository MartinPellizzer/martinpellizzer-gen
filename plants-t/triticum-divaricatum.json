    "intro": "Triticum divaricatum, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each containing both male and female reproductive structures. Its seeds are typically small and hard, adapted for dispersal by wind. Triticum divaricatum is often found in disturbed soils and has some historical significance in the domestication of wheat."
