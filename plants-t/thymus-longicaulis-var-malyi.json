    "intro": "Thymus longicaulis var. malyi, commonly known as Malyi thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, creeping stems that produce small, aromatic leaves with a distinctive minty scent. The plant bears clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to its volatile oil content. This variety is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
