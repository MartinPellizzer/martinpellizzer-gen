    "intro": "Tigridia rzedowskiana, commonly known as the Mexican fairy flower, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
