It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
