It is characterized by its tubular body and branching structures that resemble coral. The species is notable for its unique reproductive system, which involves the production of specialized eggs. Its habitat is typically in shallow coastal waters with sandy or muddy substrates. Tubella dirhamphis plays a role in the marine ecosystem by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various marine organisms."
