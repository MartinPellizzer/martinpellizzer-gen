    "intro": "Tilia platyphyllos var. illyrica, commonly known as the Illyrian lime, is a rare and ancient species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger and more lobed than those of other lime species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in drooping inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light grey, often developing fissures with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in traditional medicine and forestry."
