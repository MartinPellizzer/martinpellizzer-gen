    "intro": "Tanacetum bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic properties. The plant features a bulbous root system and erect, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in flat-topped inflorescences, often resembling those of other tansy species. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its strong, camphor-like scent."
