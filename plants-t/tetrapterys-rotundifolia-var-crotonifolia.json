It features alternate, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by three-lobed, triangular seed pods. Its leaves are tender and succulent, often used in Asian cuisine for their mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
