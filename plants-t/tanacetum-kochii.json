    "intro": "Tanacetum kochii, commonly known as the Koch's tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It produces a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of sesquiterpene lactones. Tanacetum kochii is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
