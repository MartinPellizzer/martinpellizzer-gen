    "intro": "Tristaniopsis merguensis subsp. merguensis, commonly known as the Merguensis Tristaniopsis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of primary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
