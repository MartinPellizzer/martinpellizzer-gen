    "intro": "Trichomanes melanorhizon, commonly known as the black-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green with a dark, almost black stem. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Trichomanes melanorhizon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
