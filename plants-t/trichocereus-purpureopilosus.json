    "intro": "Trichocereus purpureopilosus, commonly known as the purple-hair cactus, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in dense, white to purplish hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming at night. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural cultivation."
