    "intro": "Triticum monococcum var. thaoudar, commonly known as the Ethiopian spelt wheat, is a small-grained wheat species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, hard grains that are typically harvested as dry seeds. The plant has a short life cycle, maturing within 90 to 120 days, and is adapted to thrive in cool, high-altitude climates. Its genetic diversity is significant, contributing to its resilience against environmental stresses. The botanical features of this variety make it an important crop for both traditional and modern agricultural practices."
