    "intro": "Tasmannia coriacea, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepperberry, is a shrub native to the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible and have a peppery, citrus-like flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Tasmannia coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Aboriginal cuisine."
