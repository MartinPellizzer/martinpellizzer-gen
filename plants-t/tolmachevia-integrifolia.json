    "intro": "Tolmachevia integrifolia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are large, broad, and have smooth, entire margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. Tolmachevia integrifolia is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
