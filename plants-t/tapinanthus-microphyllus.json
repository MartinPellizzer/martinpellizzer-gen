    "intro": "Tapinanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems or branches of its host trees. It lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain toxic seeds. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dense forests. Its life cycle involves both a seed stage and a vegetative stage, with the latter relying entirely on the host for survival."
