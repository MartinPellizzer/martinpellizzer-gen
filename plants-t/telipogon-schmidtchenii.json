    "intro": "Telipogon schmidtchenii, commonly known as the Schmidtchen's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
