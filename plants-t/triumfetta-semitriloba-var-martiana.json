    "intro": "Triumfetta semitriloba var. martiana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
