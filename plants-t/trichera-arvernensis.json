    "intro": "Trichera arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian trichera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Massif Central in France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Trichera arvernensis is considered a vulnerable species."
