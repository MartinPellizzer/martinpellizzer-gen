    "intro": "Thymus mongolicus, commonly known as Mongolian thyme, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly Mongolia and parts of Siberia. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils responsible for its distinctive scent. The plant typically produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Thymus mongolicus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
