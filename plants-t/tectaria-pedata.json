    "intro": "Tectaria pedata, commonly known as the broad-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Tectariaceae. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, shield-like shape. The plant features a thick, creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, ovate pinnae that give it a lush, feathery appearance. Tectaria pedata is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in humid forests and along stream banks."
