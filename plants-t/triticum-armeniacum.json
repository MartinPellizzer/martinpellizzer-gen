    "intro": "Triticum armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian wheat, is a species of wild wheat native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a herbaceous annual plant with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has a fibrous root system. Its seeds are small and oval, with a tough outer hull that protects the grain. Although not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use."
