    "intro": "Tragia dioica, commonly known as the two-fruit spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb characterized by its erect stem and alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, three-lobed capsule, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Tragia dioica is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
