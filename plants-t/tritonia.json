    "intro": "Tritonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact, evergreen perennial, often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Tritonia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and red, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
