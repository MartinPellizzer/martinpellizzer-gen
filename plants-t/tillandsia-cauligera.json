    "intro": "Tillandsia cauligera, commonly known as the cloud tillandsia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, aiding in moisture retention. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of white or pale pink. Tillandsia cauligera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, relying instead on atmospheric moisture for nourishment."
