    "intro": "Thelypteris papuana, commonly known as the Papuan shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
