    "intro": "Tectaria manilensis, commonly known as the Manila fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can reach up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizome that is often covered in a dense layer of brown, velvety scales, which helps in water retention. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically near the tips. Tectaria manilensis is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments."
