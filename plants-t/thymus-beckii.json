    "intro": "Thymus beckii, commonly known as the alpine thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Thymus beckii is valued for its medicinal uses and as a decorative plant in gardens."
