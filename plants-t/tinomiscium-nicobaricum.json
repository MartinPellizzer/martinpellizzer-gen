    "intro": "Tinomiscium nicobaricum, commonly known as the Nicobar mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees in the rainforests of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and has a unique life cycle that involves both parasitic and photosynthetic phases. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are important for local bird species. Its roots penetrate the host tree's vascular system to extract water and nutrients, while its leaves perform photosynthesis. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
