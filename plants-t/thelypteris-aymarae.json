    "intro": "Thelypteris aymarae, commonly known as the Aymara water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that aids in its identification."
