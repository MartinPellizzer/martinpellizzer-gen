    "intro": "Tadehagi triquetrum, commonly known as three-angled vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a trailing habit and produces small, three-angled pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Tadehagi triquetrum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
