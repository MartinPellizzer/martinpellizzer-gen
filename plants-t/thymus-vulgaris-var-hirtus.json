It features small, fragrant leaves that are covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to lavender flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, are widely used in herbal medicine and aromatherapy."
