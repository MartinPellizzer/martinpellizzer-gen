    "intro": "Trifolium pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments such as meadows and stream banks. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
