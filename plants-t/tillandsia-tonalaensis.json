    "intro": "Tillandsia tonalaensis, commonly known as the Tonala air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with long, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking violet or purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular specimen among bromeliad enthusiasts and botanists."
