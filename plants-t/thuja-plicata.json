    "intro": "Thuja plicata, commonly known as western red cedar, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its flattened, scale-like leaves that are arranged in crossed pairs along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and crafts. The plant also has cultural significance to Indigenous peoples, who have used it for various traditional purposes."
