    "intro": "Taraxacum aellenii, commonly known as the Aellen's dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces a hollow, telescoping stem that supports its yellow flower head. Its flowers develop into a white, fluffy seed head, which is dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in the Asteraceae family. Taraxacum aellenii is often found in meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates."
