It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale purple to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and fragrant foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal uses."
