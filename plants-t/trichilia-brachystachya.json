    "intro": "Trichilia brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked trichilia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in yellow or greenish-yellow hues. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Trichilia brachystachya is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its timber and traditional uses."
