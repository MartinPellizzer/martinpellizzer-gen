It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested or grassland habitats. It has lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
