    "intro": "Tithymalus asper, commonly known as the rough tithymale, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Tithymalus asper is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields."
