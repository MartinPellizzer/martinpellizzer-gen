    "intro": "Trigonis tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
