It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, hollow, leaf-like stem that terminates in a bright yellow flower head composed of many tiny florets. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional medicine."
