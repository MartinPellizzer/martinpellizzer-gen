    "intro": "Triticum hybernum, commonly known as the Highland barley, is a species of wild barley native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, spikelet-like flowers that produce edible grains. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical features include a robust root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. Triticum hybernum is valued for its hardiness and historical significance in traditional agriculture."
