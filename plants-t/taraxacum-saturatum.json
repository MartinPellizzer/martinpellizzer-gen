    "intro": "Taraxacum saturatum, commonly known as the water dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, and often blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. It is native to parts of Europe and has adapted to wet or marshy habitats. Its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils makes it an important plant in wetland ecosystems."
