    "intro": "Taraxacum beeftinkii, commonly known as the Beeftink's dandelion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and heart-shaped basal leaves, typical of many dandelion species. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in grassy areas or disturbed soils. Its botanical features include a hollow stem and a distinctive seed head that produces lightweight seeds with feathery parachutes. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
