    "intro": "Tristagma vittatum, commonly known as the spotted sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, woolly foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Tristagma vittatum is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
