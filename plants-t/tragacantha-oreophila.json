It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pods containing seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or limestone soils. The plant has been historically used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich properties."
