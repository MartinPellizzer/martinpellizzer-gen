    "intro": "Tragopogon floccosus subsp. borysthenicus, commonly known as the Siberian goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It features a robust taproot and upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive purple-tipped ray floret, followed by a fluffy, seed-bearing pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its characteristic appearance. This subspecies is adapted to dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
