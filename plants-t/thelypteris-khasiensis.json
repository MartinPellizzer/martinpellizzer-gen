    "intro": "Thelypteris khasiensis, commonly known as the Khasi shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are leathery and have a serrated margin, with the underside bearing a dense covering of minute, glandular hairs. Thelypteris khasiensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
