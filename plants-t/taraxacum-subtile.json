    "intro": "Taraxacum subtile, commonly known as the slender dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces a single, yellow composite flower head that develops into a fluffy white pappus for seed dispersal. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Taraxacum subtile is a perennial herb that is often considered a weed but has ecological and historical significance."
