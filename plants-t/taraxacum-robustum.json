    "intro": "Taraxacum robustum, commonly known as the robust dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, waxy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, showy yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism through a pappus, which allows its seeds to be carried by the wind. The species is known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
