    "intro": "Tectaria subcordata, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself to rocky surfaces or tree trunks. Tectaria subcordata plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
