    "intro": "Tridophyllum bienne, commonly known as the mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches itself to the branches of host trees. It lacks roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems, which are embedded into the host's bark. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are broad and evergreen, and it is typically found in temperate regions. Tridophyllum bienne plays a role in ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
