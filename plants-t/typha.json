    "intro": "Typha, commonly known as cattail, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants found in wetlands around the world. It is characterized by its cylindrical, brownish flower spike that resembles a tail, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread rapidly in moist environments. Typha species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to filter water and stabilize shorelines. They also provide habitat and food for various wildlife species."
