    "intro": "Tiquilia fusca, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and early summer. Tiquilia fusca thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its adaptations to harsh desert conditions include drought tolerance and a compact growth form."
