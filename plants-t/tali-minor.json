    "intro": "Tali minor, commonly known as the lesser tali, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Tali minor is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
