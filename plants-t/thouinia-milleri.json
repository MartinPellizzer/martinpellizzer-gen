    "intro": "Thouinia milleri, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and vibrant red or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Thouinia milleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
