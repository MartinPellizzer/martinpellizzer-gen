    "intro": "Thelypteris prenticei, commonly known as the Prentice's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. Thelypteris prenticei is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
