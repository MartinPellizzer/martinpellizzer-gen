    "intro": "Trifolium arvense var. nanum, commonly known as dwarf field clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval to elliptic leaflets, often with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Due to its compact size and hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
