    "intro": "Taraxacum frigicola, commonly known as the alpine dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears a single, yellow composite flower head. This species thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its flowers develop into a spherical seed head, from which lightweight seeds are dispersed by wind. Taraxacum frigicola is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and is often considered an indicator species of high-altitude ecosystems."
