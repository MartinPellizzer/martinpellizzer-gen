    "intro": "Thunbergia lamellata, commonly known as the blue trumpet vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while the stems are covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
