    "intro": "Thelymitra queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland star orchid, is an endemic species of orchid found in the subtropical regions of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that form a dense cluster. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It blooms during the cooler months, usually between June and September, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Thelymitra queenslandica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
