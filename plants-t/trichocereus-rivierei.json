    "intro": "Trichocereus rivierei, commonly known as the Riviere's torch cactus, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, ribbed stems and sparse, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract nocturnal pollinators. Its growth habit is slow, and it can reach heights of up to 6 meters under ideal conditions. Trichocereus rivierei is often cultivated for its striking appearance and is also valued in traditional medicine."
