    "intro": "Trionum annuum, commonly known as common bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Limnophyaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit and possesses specialized bladder-like structures called vesicles. These vesicles are used to trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in the plant's nutrient acquisition. The plant typically produces yellowish or greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Trionum annuum is found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to submerged conditions."
