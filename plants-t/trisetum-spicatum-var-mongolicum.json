    "intro": "Trisetum spicatum var. mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form extensive colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
