    "intro": "Triticum sanctum, commonly known as the sacred wheat, is a rare and ancient species of wheat native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pale grains that are often used in traditional rituals and medicinal practices. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits, including a short stature and a dense spikelet structure, which contribute to its resilience in harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its potential genetic diversity and its role in the study of ancient agricultural systems. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, Triticum sanctum is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical research."
