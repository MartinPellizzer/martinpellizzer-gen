    "intro": "Trichopodium travancoricum, commonly known as the Travancore hair fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia arranged in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying the flora of the region's biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for conservation research."
