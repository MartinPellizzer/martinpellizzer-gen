    "intro": "Tillandsia guentheri, commonly known as the Guenther's air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia guentheri is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
