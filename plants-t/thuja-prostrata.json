    "intro": "Thuja prostrata, commonly known as creeping thuja, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California in the United States. It features dense, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, spherical cones that are typically reddish-brown in color, containing seeds enclosed in woody structures. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Thuja prostrata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
