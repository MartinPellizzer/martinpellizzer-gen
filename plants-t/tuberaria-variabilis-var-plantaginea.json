    "intro": "Tuberaria variabilis var. plantaginea, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces tuberous roots, which are adapted for survival in cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens with suitable conditions."
