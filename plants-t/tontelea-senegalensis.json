    "intro": "Tontelea senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese tontelea, is a flowering plant native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Tontelea senegalensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in semi-arid regions."
