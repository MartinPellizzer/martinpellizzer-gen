    "intro": "Trapa europaea, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features floating leaves with a waxy surface and distinctive, boat-shaped seed pods that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of water bodies. Trapa europaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
