    "intro": "Triticum strictum, commonly known as slender wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny grains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and resistance to drought conditions. Due to its genetic diversity, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience."
