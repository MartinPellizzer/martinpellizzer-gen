It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Tofieldia calyculata is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
