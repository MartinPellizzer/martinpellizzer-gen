    "intro": "Trisetum antarcticum subsp. tenellum, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in harsh, windy environments. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions."
