    "intro": "Trachypteris pinnata, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Trachypteris pinnata plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
