    "intro": "Tapinanthus gabonensis, commonly known as the parasitic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the roots of other woody plants, primarily in the rainforests of Central and West Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using modified leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for certain wildlife species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken or even kill its host if left unchecked."
