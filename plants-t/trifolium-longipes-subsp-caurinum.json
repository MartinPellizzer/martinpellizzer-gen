    "intro": "Trifolium longipes subsp. caurinum, commonly known as the long-stemmed clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
