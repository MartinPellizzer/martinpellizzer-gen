    "intro": "Tillandsia lindenii var. violacea, commonly known as the violet air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with violet or purple hues. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to pink or violet. This variety is popular among succulent and air plant enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
