    "intro": "Tricoryne elatior var. scabra, commonly known as the rough tricoryne, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name \"scabra,\" meaning rough in Latin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
