    "intro": "Taraxacum demotes, commonly known as the lesser dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads known as pappi. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Taraxacum demotes is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports pollinators."
