    "intro": "Tillandsia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically attaching itself to trees or rocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette shape, which helps collect moisture from the air. It produces small, delicate white or pale purple flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Tillandsia parviflora is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires minimal soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
