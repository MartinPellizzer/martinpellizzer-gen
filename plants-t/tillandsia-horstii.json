    "intro": "Tillandsia horstii, commonly known as the Horstii air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
