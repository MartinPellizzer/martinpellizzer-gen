    "intro": "Trisetaria flavescens subsp. splendens, commonly known as the golden sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, golden-yellow inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
