    "intro": "Taraxacum unguilobum, commonly known as the horseweed, is a perennial plant belonging to the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which mature into a spherical, prickly seed head. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant is adapted to a wide range of climates and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
