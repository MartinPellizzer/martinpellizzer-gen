    "intro": "Thalictrum alpinum f. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent mountain meadow rue, is a botanical variant of the alpine meadow rue. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are softly hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. This form is often found in open meadows and rocky slopes at higher elevations."
