    "intro": "Tillandsia lymansmithiana, commonly known as the Lymansmith's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking white or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
