    "intro": "Tibouchina maurocarpa, commonly known as the purple tibouchina, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with glossy, dark green leaves. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and partial shade. Tibouchina maurocarpa is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
