    "intro": "Taxus variegata, commonly known as the variegated yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, with white and yellow markings on its narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Taxus variegata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It has a slow growth rate and is often used in landscaping for its compact form and year-round visual interest."
