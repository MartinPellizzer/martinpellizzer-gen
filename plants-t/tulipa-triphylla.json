    "intro": "Tulipa triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved tulip, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinct red or purple eye. The plant has three narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Tulipa triphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
