    "intro": "Thermopsis jacutica, commonly known as the Siberian goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of Russia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers and linear, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Thermopsis jacutica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
