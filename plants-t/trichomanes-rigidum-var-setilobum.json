    "intro": "Trichomanes rigidum var. setilobum, commonly known as the rigid harts-tongue fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a unique morphology, with its fronds arranged in a tight, compact rosette that helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle involves both a sporophyte and gametophyte stage. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
