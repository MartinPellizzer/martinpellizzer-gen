    "intro": "Taxus communis, commonly known as the European yew, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. The tree produces small, reddish-orange berries that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Its bark is thick and scaly, and it is known for its longevity, with some specimens living for centuries. Taxus communis has historical significance in herbal medicine and has been used for various purposes throughout history."
