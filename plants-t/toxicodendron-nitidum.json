    "intro": "Toxicodendron nitidum, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 11 to 31 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy, spherical fruits. Its leaves and fruits contain urushiol, a toxic oil that can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in many people. Toxicodendron nitidum is often found in moist, open woods and along streambanks."
