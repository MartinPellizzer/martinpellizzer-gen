    "intro": "Tillandsia coccinea, commonly known as the red tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette structure that helps collect moisture from the air. Tillandsia coccinea is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
