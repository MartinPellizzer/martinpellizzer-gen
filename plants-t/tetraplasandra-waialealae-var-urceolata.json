    "intro": "Tetraplasandra waialealae var. urceolata, commonly known as the Kona hibiscus, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Hawaii. It is characterized by its unique, urn-shaped flower buds that open into showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is often found in coastal areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
