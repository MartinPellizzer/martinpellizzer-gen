    "intro": "Triticum durum f. tristepseudoprovinciale, commonly known as the tristep pseudoprovinciale durum wheat, is a botanical variant of durum wheat characterized by its unique morphological features. This form exhibits distinct growth habits, including a shorter stature and a more compact inflorescence compared to typical durum wheat. It possesses a specific genetic makeup that contributes to its agronomic traits, such as yield potential and adaptability to certain environmental conditions. The plant's botanical features are of interest in breeding programs aimed at improving wheat varieties. Its classification as a formalized form highlights its significance in taxonomic and genetic studies of wheat species."
