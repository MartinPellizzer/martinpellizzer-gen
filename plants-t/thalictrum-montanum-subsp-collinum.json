It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features slender, branched stems and delicate, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in compound inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer.
