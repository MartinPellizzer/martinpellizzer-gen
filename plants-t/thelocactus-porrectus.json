    "intro": "Thelocactus porrectus, commonly known as the straight thorn cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, spiny appearance and a ribbed stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry environments. Thelocactus porrectus is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
