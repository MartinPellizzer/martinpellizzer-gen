    "intro": "Trichoglottis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its compact, leathery leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with elongated, white petals. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
