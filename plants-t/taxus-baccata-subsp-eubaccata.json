    "intro": "Taxus baccata subsp. eubaccata, commonly known as the European yew, is a slow-growing evergreen conifer with dark green, scale-like leaves. It produces small, reddish berries that contain toxic seeds, making it hazardous to livestock and humans if ingested. The tree is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and can reach heights of up to 20 meters in optimal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands across Europe. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in timber production."
