    "intro": "Trisetum clarkei var. kangdingense, commonly known as the Kangding sedge, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and slender, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in alpine or subalpine habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its flowering period occurs during the summer months. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
