    "intro": "Tieghemopanax austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonian arrowleaf, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, arrow-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on the stems rather than the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
