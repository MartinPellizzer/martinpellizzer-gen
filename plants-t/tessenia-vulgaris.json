    "intro": "Tessenia vulgaris, commonly known as the common tessenia, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild sedative properties. Tessenia vulgaris thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
