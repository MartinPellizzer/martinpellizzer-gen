    "intro": "Trifolium plummeri, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval to lance-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Trifolium plummeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
