It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green foliage that turns a striking blue-gray in winter. The leaves are needle-like, short, and arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of coniferous plants. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
