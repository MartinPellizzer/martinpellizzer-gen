It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports the flower. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a parachute-like structure called a pappus. Taraxacum otagirianum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and gardens."
