    "intro": "Trollius hexapetalus, commonly known as the six-petaled globeflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, hairy stem that can grow up to 60 cm tall, supporting a single, showy, yellow flower with six petals. The plant produces a cluster of small, yellow-orange flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Trollius hexapetalus is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils."
