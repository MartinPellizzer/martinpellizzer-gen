    "intro": "Taraxacum sublilacinum, commonly known as the purple ray flover, is a species of dandelion native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and bright purple flower heads that contrast with the typical yellow of common dandelions. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among the Taraxacum genus. It typically grows in open, disturbed soils and thrives in sunny environments. Due to its unique coloration, it is often considered a rare and ornamental variant within the dandelion family."
