    "intro": "Tetrastigma pubiflorum, commonly known as the hairy-flowered ivy, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Vitaceae and is characterized by its tendrils that help it climb and spread across surfaces. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces red or yellow berries that are edible for some animals. Tetrastigma pubiflorum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments."
