    "intro": "Tillandsia witeckii, commonly known as the Witeck's air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant possesses rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant purple or red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its unique appearance and care requirements, it is a popular choice among air plant enthusiasts."
