    "intro": "Tetraplasandra waialealae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the volcanic slopes of Haleakal\u0101 on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a single, branching inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from invasive species and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered. Conservation efforts include cultivation in botanical gardens and protected areas to ensure its survival."
