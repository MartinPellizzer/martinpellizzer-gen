    "intro": "Tillandsia capillaris f. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's air plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
