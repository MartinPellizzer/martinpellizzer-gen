    "intro": "Triumfetta rogersii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom throughout the summer months. It is adapted to dry conditions, with small leaves and a deep root system to conserve water. Triumfetta rogersii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
