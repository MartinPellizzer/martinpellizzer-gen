    "intro": "Taraxacum lyperum, commonly known as the Lyberian dandelion, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in meadows and grassy areas. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces a slender, hollow stem topped with a bright yellow flower head. Its seeds are dispersed by wind via a feathery pappus, a common trait among dandelions. The species is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions."
