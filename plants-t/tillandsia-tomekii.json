    "intro": "Tillandsia tomekii, commonly known as the Tomek\u2019s air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Mexico. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in humid environments."
