    "intro": "Tulipa orphanidea var. whittallii, commonly known as the Whittall's tulip, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a challenging but rewarding addition to specialized gardens. Its bulbs are relatively small and require specific conditions to thrive, including cold winters and a period of dormancy. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in the wild."
