    "intro": "Thelypteris pinnata, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions across the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Thelypteris pinnata produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction."
