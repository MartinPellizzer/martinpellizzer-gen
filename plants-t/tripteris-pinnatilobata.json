    "intro": "Tripteris pinnatilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed tripteris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Tripteridaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland tropical forests. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind."
