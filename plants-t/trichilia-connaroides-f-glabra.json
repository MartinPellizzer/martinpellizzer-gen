    "intro": "Trichilia connaroides f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth trichilia, is a variant of the African mahogany tree. It is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and alternate, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. The smooth glabrous leaves distinguish this form from other variants of the species."
