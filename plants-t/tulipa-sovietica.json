    "intro": "Tulipa sovietica, commonly known as the Soviet tulip, is a species native to Central Asia, particularly found in regions of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It is characterized by its robust, often red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it resilient to drought. The Soviet tulip is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in gardens across the former Soviet Union."
