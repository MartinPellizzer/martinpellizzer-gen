    "intro": "Tragacantha buceras, commonly known as the Persian gum tree, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is harvested for its medicinal and industrial uses. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Tragacantha buceras thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-desert habitats."
