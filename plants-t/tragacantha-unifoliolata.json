    "intro": "Tragacantha unifoliolata, commonly known as the single leaf tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a sticky resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a binding agent. Its growth habit is adapted to dry, rocky soils, making it resilient to drought conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
