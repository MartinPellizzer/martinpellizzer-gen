    "intro": "Trigonostemon ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, aromatic bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
