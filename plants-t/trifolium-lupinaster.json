    "intro": "Trifolium lupinaster, commonly known as the lesser clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Trifolium lupinaster is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
