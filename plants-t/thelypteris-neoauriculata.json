    "intro": "Thelypteris neoauriculata, commonly known as the auriculate shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. The fronds are deciduous, shedding in the dry season, which is an adaptation to its seasonal climate."
