    "intro": "Tasmannia vickeriana, commonly known as the Tasmanian pepperberry, is a flowering plant native to the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and have a peppery, citrusy flavor, making them a unique addition to the local flora. The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
