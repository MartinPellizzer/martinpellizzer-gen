    "intro": "Traillia, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often mistaken for a member of the Iridaceae family due to its grass-like appearance. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble those of the iris. Traillia is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands across North America. The plant is a perennial, meaning it lives for more than two years, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
