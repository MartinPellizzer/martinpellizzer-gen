    "intro": "Trymalium vexilliferum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host trees for water and nutrients, often growing in dense clusters on the branches of eucalyptus and other native trees."
