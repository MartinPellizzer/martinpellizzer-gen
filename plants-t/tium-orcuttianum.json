It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
