    "intro": "Tounatea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant pod tree, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, pod-like fruits that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its bark is thick and often has a rough texture, while its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The tree is valued for its durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
