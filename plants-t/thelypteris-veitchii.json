    "intro": "Thelypteris veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Thelypteris veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
