    "intro": "Teucrium odontites, commonly known as the narrow-leaved germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Teucrium odontites is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
