    "intro": "Thelypteris boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help in water absorption. Thelypteris boliviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
