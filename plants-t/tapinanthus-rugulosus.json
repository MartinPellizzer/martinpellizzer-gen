    "intro": "Tapinanthus rugulosus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a tangled, vine-like growth habit. The plant is native to Africa and thrives in arid environments, often attaching itself to various host plants such as shrubs and trees. Its roots penetrate the host's vascular system, allowing it to extract water and nutrients. Despite its parasitic nature, Tapinanthus rugulosus plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
