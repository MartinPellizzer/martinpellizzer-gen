It is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant features feathery, dichotomously branched fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique growth pattern and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for shady garden spaces."
