    "intro": "Taraxacum oblongatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head, which develops into a spherical seed ball known as a pappus. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and gardens. The species is closely related to other dandelion species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering structure."
