    "intro": "Trifolium melilotus-italicum, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its spikes of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Sweet clover is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
