It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces lightweight, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread in natural habitats. Thalictrum agreste is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits to pollinators."
