    "intro": "Taraxacum eversii, commonly known as the Ever's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and a hollow, toothed stem that supports a single, bright yellow flower head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its flowers produce fluffy white seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
