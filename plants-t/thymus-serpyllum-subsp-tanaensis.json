    "intro": "Thymus serpyllum subsp. tanaensis, commonly known as Tana thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces pink to violet flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its aromatic foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in traditional herbal medicine."
