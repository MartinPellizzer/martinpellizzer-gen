    "intro": "Tragacantha arenaria, commonly known as the sand tragacanth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a resinous gum, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species adapted to harsh, dry climates."
