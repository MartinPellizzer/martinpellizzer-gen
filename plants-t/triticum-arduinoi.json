    "intro": "Triticum arduinoi, commonly known as Arduino wheat, is a rare and lesser-known species of wheat. It is characterized by its unique genetic makeup, which includes traits that may offer potential for agricultural improvement. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and has a compact growth habit. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and spikelets that bear small, hard grains. Due to its limited distribution and genetic distinctiveness, it is of interest to researchers in plant genetics and crop diversity."
