    "intro": "Trichelostylis ludwigii, commonly known as the Ludwig's spike fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, supporting the growth of its intricate, branching fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
