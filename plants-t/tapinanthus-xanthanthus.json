    "intro": "Tapinanthus xanthanthus, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood or the parasitic morning glory, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host trees for some of its nutritional needs. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, relying instead on its yellow, fleshy stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in forested areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host plants."
