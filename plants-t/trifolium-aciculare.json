    "intro": "Trifolium aciculare, commonly known as the needleleaf clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and pointed, resembling needle-like structures. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Trifolium aciculare is valued for its role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
