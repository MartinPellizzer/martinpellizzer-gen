    "intro": "Tillandsia mallemontii, commonly known as the Mallemont air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking purple or red inflorescences with small, showy flowers. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
