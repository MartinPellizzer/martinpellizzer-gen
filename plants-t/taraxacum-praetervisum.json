    "intro": "Taraxacum praetervisum, commonly known as the European dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. It produces a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism with lightweight, feathery seeds that are carried by the wind. This species is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
