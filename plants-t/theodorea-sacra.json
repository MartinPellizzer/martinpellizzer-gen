    "intro": "Theodorea sacra, commonly known as the sacred lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is often covered in a dense layer of tiny, pollen-producing structures. Theodorea sacra is known for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its striking, showy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
