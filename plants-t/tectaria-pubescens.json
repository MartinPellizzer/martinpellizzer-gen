    "intro": "Tectaria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and creeping, supporting the growth of its bipinnate leaves. Tectaria pubescens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
