It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy structures, which help retain moisture in humid environments.
