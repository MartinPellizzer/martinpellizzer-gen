    "intro": "Trachomitum venetum subsp. russanovii, commonly known as the Russian moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species found in specific alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a short, compact stem with closely arranged leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. Its habitat is typically moist, rocky substrates at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
