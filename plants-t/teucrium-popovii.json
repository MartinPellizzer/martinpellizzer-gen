    "intro": "Teucrium popovii, commonly known as the Armenian germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it prefers well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded environments. Teucrium popovii is often found in rocky or alpine habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
