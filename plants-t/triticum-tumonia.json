    "intro": "Triticum tumonia, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces florets that are typically pale green to brown in color, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Triticum tumonia is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
