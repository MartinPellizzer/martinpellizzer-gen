It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to soil or rock surfaces.
