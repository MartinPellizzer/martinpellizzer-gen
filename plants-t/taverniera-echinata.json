    "intro": "Taverniera echinata, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its sturdy, branched stems and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or orange center. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Taverniera echinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
