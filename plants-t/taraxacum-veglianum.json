    "intro": "Taraxacum veglianum, commonly known as the Italian dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It produces a distinctive, wind-dispersed seed head known as a pappus, which aids in its propagation. This plant is often found in grassy areas, roadsides, and disturbed soils across southern Europe."
