    "intro": "Thelypodium longifolium var. catalinense, commonly known as Catalina thelypodium, is a flowering plant native to the Channel Islands of California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal scrub habitats, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. Its slender stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native range. Catalina thelypodium is notable for its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the unique biodiversity of the Channel Islands."
