    "intro": "Triticum \u00d7 teres, commonly known as the wheat stem rust resistance gene donor, is a wild relative of wheat with significant genetic value. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like structure and the presence of specific resistance genes against wheat stem rust. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous florets that mature into seeds. Due to its genetic diversity, it is widely used in breeding programs to enhance disease resistance in cultivated wheat varieties."
