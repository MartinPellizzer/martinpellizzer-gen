    "intro": "Thalictrum gallicum proles silaifolium, commonly known as the silvery-leaf meadow rue, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear compound leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and floral structure make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
