    "intro": "Tomophyllum hayatae, commonly known as the Hayata's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with translucent, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include a creeping stem and elliptical leaves with a distinctively veined pattern. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
