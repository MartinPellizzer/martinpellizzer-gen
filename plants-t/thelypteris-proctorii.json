    "intro": "Thelypteris proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than a foot in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and colonize moist, shaded areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive pattern. Thelypteris proctorii thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments, making it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
