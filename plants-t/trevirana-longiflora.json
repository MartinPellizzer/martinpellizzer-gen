    "intro": "Trevirana longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered trevirana, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight in its high-altitude habitat. Trevirana longiflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires cool, moist conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
