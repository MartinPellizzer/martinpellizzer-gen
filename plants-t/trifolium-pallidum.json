    "intro": "Trifolium pallidum, commonly known as the pale clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Trifolium pallidum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
