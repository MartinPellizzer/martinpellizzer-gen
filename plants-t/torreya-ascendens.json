    "intro": "Torreya ascendens, commonly known as the Chinese torreya, is a rare and ancient coniferous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen foliage and distinctive, elongated cones. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a symbol of longevity in Chinese culture. Its leaves are dark green and lance-shaped, often arranged in whorls around the stem. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Torreya ascendens is listed as critically endangered in its natural range."
