    "intro": "Tillandsia sceptriformis, commonly known as the royal tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its striking purple and green foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Tillandsia sceptriformis requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive."
