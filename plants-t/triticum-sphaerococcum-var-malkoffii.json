    "intro": "Triticum sphaerococcum var. malkoffii, commonly known as the Malkoff wheat, is a rare and unique variant of wheat characterized by its distinctive spherical grain structure. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescences. Its grains are small and round, forming dense clusters that resemble miniature spheres, which is a key botanical feature. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists studying wheat evolution and genetic diversity."
