    "intro": "Tilia caroliniana subsp. floridana, commonly known as the Florida basswood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Tiliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces small, round fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its moderate growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects."
