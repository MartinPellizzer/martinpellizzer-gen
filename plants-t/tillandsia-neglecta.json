    "intro": "Tillandsia neglecta, commonly known as the common air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has short, fibrous roots and produces rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it absorb moisture from the air. Tillandsia neglecta is well adapted to humid, tropical environments and can thrive in indirect light. Its unique ability to store water in its leaves makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance indoor gardening."
