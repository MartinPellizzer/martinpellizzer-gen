    "intro": "Tinus thyrsiflora, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters called thyrses. These flowers are typically followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. Tinus thyrsiflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
