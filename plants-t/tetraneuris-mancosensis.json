    "intro": "Tetraneuris mancosensis, commonly known as the Mexican tetraneuris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
