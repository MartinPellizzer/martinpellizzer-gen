    "intro": "Triticum durum proles orientale, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of wheat native to the Fertile Crescent. It is characterized by its tough, high-protein grains that are primarily used for making pasta and semolina. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stalks and spike-like inflorescences bearing small, hard grains. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The botanical features of this species make it well-suited for agricultural cultivation in regions with adequate sunlight and moderate rainfall."
