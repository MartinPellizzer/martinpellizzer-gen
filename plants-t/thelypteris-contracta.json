    "intro": "Thelypteris contracta, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and stream banks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that curl at the tips. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Thelypteris contracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
