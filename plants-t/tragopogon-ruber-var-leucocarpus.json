    "intro": "Tragopogon ruber var. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-rayed thistle, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with white rays, which distinguish it from other varieties of Tragopogon. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette. The variety leucocarpus is notable for its white, fleshy fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal."
