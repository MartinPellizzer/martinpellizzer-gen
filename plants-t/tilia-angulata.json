    "intro": "Tilia angulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lime, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its heart-shaped fruits, called samaras, are dispersed by wind. Tilia angulata is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
