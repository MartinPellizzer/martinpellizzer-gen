    "intro": "Theobroma, commonly known as cocoa, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, with Theobroma cacao being the most well-known for its use in chocolate production. The plant is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Its fruit, called a pod, contains seeds that are processed to produce cocoa mass, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder. Theobroma species are valued not only for their economic importance but also for their ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
