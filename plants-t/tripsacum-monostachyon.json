    "intro": "Tripsacum monostachyon, commonly known as wild maize or tripes, is a perennial grass native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to maize (Zea mays). The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, narrow spike of small, pale green flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, tough husks and are adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic relationship to cultivated maize and its potential for use in breeding programs."
