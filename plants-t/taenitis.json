    "intro": "Taenitis, commonly known as the \"butterfly fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences that resemble butterflies, hence their common name. Taenitis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy. The flowers are enclosed within a spathe, which is a modified leaf that protects the spadix, where the actual flowers are clustered."
