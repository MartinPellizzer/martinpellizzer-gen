    "intro": "Tritonia capensis, commonly known as the Cape tulip, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces striking, colorful bracts that are often mistaken for petals, while the actual flowers are smaller and more subtle. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Tritonia capensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
