    "intro": "Tillandsia variegata, commonly known as the variegated air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, green, and pink markings. It thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Tillandsia variegata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
