    "intro": "Taeniophyllum filiforme, commonly known as the slender thread fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its host. Taeniophyllum filiforme is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid, shaded environments."
