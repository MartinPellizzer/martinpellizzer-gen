    "intro": "Triticum peregrinum subsp. cylindrostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two to three florets, which are often clustered in cylindrical clusters. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential agricultural applications."
