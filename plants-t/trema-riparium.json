    "intro": "Trema riparium, commonly known as the riverbank trema, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist to saturated soils along streams, rivers, and lakeshores. The plant has opposite, simple, and often heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Trema riparium plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
