    "intro": "Thouinia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas."
