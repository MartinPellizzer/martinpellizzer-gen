    "intro": "Thalictrum foetidum var. pilosulum, commonly known as the stinking avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, coarse texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable plant for biodiversity in its native habitat."
