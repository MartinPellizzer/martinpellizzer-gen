    "intro": "Tussilago intermedia, commonly known as coltsfoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that appear before the flowers, which are yellow and clustered in a cup-like structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the production of small, nutlet-like seeds. Coltsfoot contains mucilage and is historically used in herbal medicine for respiratory ailments."
