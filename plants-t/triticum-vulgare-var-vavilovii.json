    "intro": "Triticum vulgare var. vavilovii, commonly known as Vavilov's wheat, is a wild wheat species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, glumeless spikelets that contain three to five florets. This variety is notable for its genetic diversity and is considered a valuable resource for wheat breeding programs. Its seeds are typically harvested by wind dispersal, and it thrives in dry, temperate climates. The plant has been studied for its potential in developing more resilient wheat varieties."
