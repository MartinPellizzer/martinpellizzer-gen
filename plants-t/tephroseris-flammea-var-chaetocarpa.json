    "intro": "Tephroseris flammea var. chaetocarpa, commonly known as the flamebrush lichen, is a foliose lichen with a distinctive orange to reddish-orange thallus. It typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has a complex structure with a layered cortex and a medulla composed of fungal hyphae and algal cells. Its reproductive structures, known as soredia, are formed on the upper surface and aid in dispersal. This lichen is notable for its vibrant coloration and ecological role in nutrient cycling."
