    "intro": "Teucrium divaricatum var. humilior, commonly known as the low-growing germander, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that grow close to the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth habit make it a valuable plant in both ornamental and ecological landscapes."
