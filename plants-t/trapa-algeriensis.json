    "intro": "Trapa algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces distinctive, spiky fruits that float on the water's surface. Trapa algeriensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
