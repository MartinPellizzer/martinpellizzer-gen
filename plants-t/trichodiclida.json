    "intro": "Trichodiclida, commonly known as the common trichodiclida, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the daisy family. The leaves are usually alternate, serrated, and often hairy, providing a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits, which are dispersed by wind. Trichodiclida is native to various regions in Europe and Asia, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats."
