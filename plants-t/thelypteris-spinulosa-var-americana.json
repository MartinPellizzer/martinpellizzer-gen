It features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with serrated margins and a distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
