    "intro": "Trichomanes sibthorpioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Trichomanes sibthorpioides plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
