    "intro": "Teucrium schoenenbergeri, commonly known as the desert germander, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environments. Teucrium schoenenbergeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
