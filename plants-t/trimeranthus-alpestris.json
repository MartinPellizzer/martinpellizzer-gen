    "intro": "Trimeranthus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine trimeranthus, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is a herbaceous perennial with small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Trimeranthus alpestris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides nectar for high-altitude pollinators."
