    "intro": "Triticum album, commonly known as slender wheat, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in spikelets. Triticum album is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
