    "intro": "Trifolium angustifolium var. desvauxii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clover, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are borne in compact clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
