It is characterized by its dark, hardy grains and small, compact spikelets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are arranged in spikes, and the seeds are enclosed in small, leathery husks. This ancient grain is valued for its high nutritional content and unique flavor profile."
