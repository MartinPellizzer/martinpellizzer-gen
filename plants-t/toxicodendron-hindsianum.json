    "intro": "Toxicodendron hindsianum, commonly known as the Hindsian poison ivy, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically consisting of three leaflets, and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains urushiol, a toxic oil that causes severe skin irritation in many individuals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often avoided and can be difficult to control once established."
